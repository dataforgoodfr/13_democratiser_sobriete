The biodiversity of food and agriculture (Agrobiodiversity) in the anthropocene: Research advances and conceptual framework,"Multiple knowledge systems are crucial to understand human-environment interactions of the biodiversity of agriculture and food systems (agrobiodiversity). This article synthesizes these knowledge systems to formulate the novel Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework comprised of four themes: (1) ecology and evolution; (2) governance; (3) food, nutrition, and health; and (4) global environmental and socioeconomic changes. Resulting characterization of these knowledge themes, joined with cross-theme integration, demonstrate advances of agrobiodiversity research, management, and policy amid the accelerated global environmental and socioeconomic transformations of the Anthropocene. Framework results guide the presentation of new data from the Agrobiodiversity, Food, and Nutrition project (AFN) in Peru. These results integrate an emphasis on factors of global change, including climate change. The combination of the new knowledge framework and project results is utilized to point toward future directions for research, policy, and management. The Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework is essential to address the transformative planetary challenges of the Anthropocene that include sustainable development with nutritional security, biodiversity conservation, social justice, climate change, and nutrient pollution. Strengthening the focus on and analysis of the complex human-environment interactions of biodiversity in agriculture and food is vital as a nexus of science, scholarship, management, and policy in the era of Earth systems dominated by human activity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Role of mineral-based industrialization in promoting economic growth: Implications for achieving environmental sustainability and social equity,"This research's problem statement centers on balancing economic development with environmental protection and social well-being. As mineral resources represent a crucial driver of economic growth in these regions, examining how their exploitation impacts economic indicators and the broader dimensions of sustainability and equity is imperative. Over the past decade (2010–2020), the role of mineral-based industrialization in fostering economic growth has garnered significant attention, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This study delves into the complex interplay between mineral-based industrialization, environmental sustainability, and social equity in these regions, employing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model as a critical analytical tool. The results of this study reveal multifaceted insights. While mineral-based industrialization has indeed contributed to economic growth in these regions, the environmental implications are significant. Often, the extraction and processing of minerals come at the cost of environmental degradation, posing challenges to sustainability. Moreover, the distribution of benefits from this growth is often unequal, exacerbating social inequities. This research underscores the complex dynamics surrounding mineral-based industrialization in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It highlights the need for a nuanced approach considering economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social equity. Policymakers and stakeholders must carefully navigate these challenges to ensure that mineral resources serve as catalysts for comprehensive and inclusive development in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Optimal timing of phasing out producer subsidies towards carbon neutrality: Interaction between fossil energy extraction and environmental uncertainties,"Since subsidies for fossil-fuel producers entail “carbon locked-in” risks, phasing out the subsidies is widely agreed to be critical for progress on climate change towards carbon neutrality. However, due to the uncertainties and irreversibilities associated with environmental degradation and economic losses, delaying removal efforts allows us to benefit from cheaper abatement options and less total abatements owning to self-regeneration of pollution stock. Therefore, whether the removal action should be taken currently or be delayed becomes vital for policy making. We develop a real option model of policy timing using a green social welfare as the objective, consisting of the standard Hotelling model of exhaustible resource extraction, and a stochastic state variable to capture uncertainties over the social costs of environmental damage. Analytic solutions are derived to show the implication of these uncertainties for policy adoption, and the results are presented: (i) a higher volatility of economic costs per emissions leads to a positive incentive for delaying removal in some bounds of uncertainties; (ii) amount of subsidies, pollution stocks, depletion of fossil fuel production and its marginal costs have negative impacts on the timing threshold, which implies that adopting currently is better than waiting; and (iii) discount rate increases the option value of delaying the policy. Our study provides a valuable framework to determine the energy and environmental policy timing with uncertainties for regulators. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Spatiotemporal evolution and driving factors of green energy efficiency in Jiangsu Province: a sustainable development perspective,"With the ongoing global climate change and energy structure transformation, green energy efficiency has become one of the key indicators for achieving sustainable development. This study uses panel data from 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province, China, from 2012 to 2022 to explore the spatiotemporal evolution and driving factors of green energy efficiency. The study employs the super-efficiency Slack-Based Measure (SBM) method to measure the green energy efficiency of each region. It uses the Gini coefficient and kernel density estimation methods to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of green energy efficiency. Furthermore, based on a fixed effects model, the study delves into the main driving factors influencing green energy efficiency. The results show that green energy efficiency in Jiangsu Province is generally on an upward trend. The Gini coefficients of both the southern and northern regions of Jiangsu have increased, but the gap in green energy efficiency between the two regions has gradually widened. The degree of government intervention and the level of industrialization are unfavorable to the growth of green energy efficiency. In contrast, foreign investment levels, financial development, and urbanization show significant positive effects. Finally, based on the empirical findings, targeted recommendations are provided to promote green energy efficiency, offering important theoretical support and empirical evidence for the country’s strategic goals of achieving green and low-carbon development.

Low-Carbon Fresh Produce Supply Chain Decision-Making Considering Government Subsidies,"With the deterioration of the greenhouse effect, countries around the world have introduced all kinds of carbon emission reduction policies to cope with the challenge of global climate change. In this background, the development of fresh produce supply chain in China has also encountered new challenges, and there is a large amount of carbon emissions in each link from production to transport to final sales of agricultural products, so the study of fresh produce supply chain decision-making problems considering carbon emissions is conducive to promoting its low-carbon and efficient operation. This paper introduces the policy of government subsidy for unit products, uses the conflict analysis method based on graph model to determine the object of government subsidy, constructs a three-stage game model under these two mandatory policies respectively, solves and numerically analyses the problem, and finally makes suggestions for the low-carbon and fresh produce decision-making of the enterprises as well as the government’s formulation of relevant policies. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",About Sufficiency
The unintended impact of carbon trading of China's power sector,"Carbon trading is considered a strategy for reallocating carbon permits and reducing abatement costs that may also change energy consumption and the distribution of atmospheric pollution emissions, resulting in environmental health benefits or damage on a regional scale. In this research, we use an agent-based model to construct a national carbon emissions trading market of the power sector based on the year of 2013, and simulate the key atmospheric pollution emission patterns and the corresponding environmental health effects. We find that compared with a command and control policy, the carbon trading policy is able to reduce the CO2 emissions and save abatement costs by approximately 63.53 RMB/ton. Meanwhile, the results show the carbon trading policy would synergistically reduce PM2.5 emissions by 1.55 million tons. Addition, we use a simplified exposure-response model to estimate health benefits by synergistically reducing PM2.5 emissions, and find that the carbon trading policy would decrease 45,200 cases of all-cause mortality and generate 307.07 billion RMB in environmental health benefits. The co-benefit accounts for 0.52% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013. However, compared with the command and control policy, carbon trading changes the pollution emission distribution among the different provinces, and results in unintended environmental health damages in some provinces. Setting reasonable trading directions and exchange ratios, increasing stringency of environmental regulations in some provinces with worsening air pollution should be implemented to complement the carbon trading policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Transportation-Induced Carbon Emissions Jeopardize Healthcare Logistics Sustainability: Toward a Healthier Today and a Better Tomorrow,"Background: Logistics operations are considered essential for transporting commodities from one location to another, helping to promote global economic activity. On the other hand, its negative impact eclipses its positive impact, namely the rise in healthcare expenditures due to its ecological footprint. Globally, rising out-of-pocket health expenses result from logistic-induced carbon emissions, posing a danger to the long-term viability of healthcare. Methods: Based on this critical fact, this study examined the impact of logistics operations on healthcare costs by controlling for carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic development across a large cross-section of 131 nations by using the Robust Least Squares Regression. Results: The findings demonstrate a U-shaped association between logistical operations and healthcare expenditures, i.e., if there is a 1% increase in logistics operations, healthcare expenditures decrease by −2.421% initially, while at later stages, healthcare costs would increase by 0.139%. On the other hand, increased fuel imports and economic growth due to logistics activities are increasing healthcare expenditures with an elasticity estimate of 0.087% and 0.147%, respectively. According to the forecasting predictions, logistics-induced carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic expansion will increase healthcare expenses. Conclusions: A sustainable logistics operation is critical for strengthening healthcare infrastructure and meeting the global carbon neutrality goal. © 2022 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Aspects of renewable energy influenced by natural resources: How do the stock market and technology play a role?,"Subsidies for fossil fuels are one of the major financial barriers to the shift to renewable energy in the world. A sustainable and safe world is based on renewable energy, which is derived from natural resources that are abundant and continuously replenished. This study investigates the impact of natural resources on renewable energy consumption in N-11 countries. It moderates the roles of economic growth, stock market capitalization, and technology from 1990 to 2020. This study involves the development of an empirical analysis, the application of advanced econometric methodologies, and the development of a comprehensive policy report. Technology and the stock market are negatively related to renewable energy consumption in the short and long run. There is a positive relationship between natural resources and renewable energy consumption both in the short and long term. A positive relationship exists between economic growth and renewable energy consumption over the long term. Energy policies must be clear, robust, transparent, supported by public support, and backed up by modern energy transmission systems implanted in N-11 countries to accelerate wind and solar energy adoption. In addition to reducing emissions, shifting subsidies to renewable energy supports sustainable economic growth, job creation, improved public health, and greater equity is recommended.

Can ratoon cropping improve resource use efficiencies and profitability of rice in central China?,"Identifying cropping systems with small global warming potential (GWP) per unit of productivity is important to ensure food security while minimizing environmental footprint. During recent decades, double-season rice (DR) systems in central China have progressively shifted into single-crop, middle-season rice (MR) due to high costs and labor requirements of double-season rice. Ratoon rice (RR) has been proposed as an alternative system that reconciliates both high annual productivity and relatively low costs and labor requirements. Here we used on-farm data collected from 240 farmer fields planted with rice in 2016 to evaluate annual energy balance, environmental impact, and net profit of MR, DR, and RR cropping systems in central China. Energy factors, emission values, and commodity prices obtained from literature and official statistics were used to estimate energy balance, GWP, and economic profit. Average annual yield was 7.7, 15.3. and 13.2 Mg ha −1 for MR, DR, and RR systems, respectively. Average total annual energy input (36 GJ ha −1 ), GWP (9783 kg ha −1 ), and production cost (3057 $ ha −1 ) of RR were 35–48% higher than those of MR. However, RR achieved 72–129% higher annual grain yield (13.2 Mg ha −1 ), net energy yield (159 GJ ha −1 ), and net economic return (2330 $ ha −1 ) than MR. Compared with DR, RR produced statistically similar net energy yield while doubling the net economic return, with 32–42% lower energy input, production costs, and GWP. Consequently, RR exhibited significantly higher net energy ratio and benefit-to-cost ratio, and substantially lower yield-scaled GWP than the other two cropping systems. In the context of DR being replaced by MR, our analysis indicated that RR can be a viable option to achieve both high annual productivity and large positive energy balance and profit, while reducing the environmental impact. © 2019 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Spatio-temporal evolution and drivers of coupling coordination between digital infrastructure and inclusive green growth: Evidence from the Yangtze River economic belt,"The change of digital technology has ushered in a new era of digital infrastructure (DI) development. Facilitating the synergistic of DI and inclusive green growth (IGG) is essential for achieving sustainable development at the regional level. This study draws on panel data from 107 cities within China's Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) and employs a variety of research methodologies, including the entropy method, the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM), exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), the Dagum Gini coefficient, the GM (1.1), and an optimal parameters-based geographical detector (OPGD). The aim is to explore the coupling coordination degree (CCD) and drivers between DI and IGG from 2011 to 2020. The findings reveal: (1) Throughout the study, the CCD within the YREB remained generally low, achieving only low coordination by 2020. However, the system demonstrates greater harmonization and improved quality each year. Spatially, the distribution pattern exhibits a distinct “high in the east and low in the west” trend. (2) The CCD exhibits a positive spatial correlation, particularly with High-High clusters concentrated in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). (3) Utilizing difference analysis and gray model predictions, the CCD level of the YREB shows considerable potential for development, with regional disparities gradually narrowing. (4) While the dominant driving factors of CCD vary across different sub-regions of the YREB, information supportability and economic driving force generally emerge as the primary drivers across different spatial sub-regions, with their impact significantly enhanced when interacting with other factors. Consequently, this study accurately identifies the driving factors in different spatial sub-divisions and suggests tailored development strategies and measures to provide more scientifically grounded policy insights. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Transboundary cooperation in infrastructure operation generates economic and environmental co-benefits in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin,"The Lancang-Mekong River Basin is facing booming water resources infrastructure development, long-term transboundary conflicts and trade-offs between economic goals and ecosystem services provision. Optimizing the pathway towards sustainable infrastructure operation has lacked multisector-coordinated and decision behaviour-based perspectives for transboundary water systems. In this study we quantified how, and to what extent, transboundary cooperation generates economic and environmental co-benefits by jointly using a coupled simulation–optimization approach and cooperative game theoretical analysis. We found that full cooperation outweighs partial or non-cooperation modes to promote economic benefits by 3 to 21% and to minimize the losses in fishery and sediment transport from 23% and 60% to 12% and 22%, respectively. Full cooperation becomes more beneficial and stable alongside infrastructure expansion, climate change and satisfying the hydrological needs of river ecosystems. These findings underscore the importance of full cooperation for sustaining socio-environmental systems and highlight the need for a benefit reallocation mechanism and designed flow management to stabilize basin-level full cooperation in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",About Sufficiency
"Sustainable livelihoods and rural sustainability in China: Ecologically secure, economically efficient or socially equitable?","Sustainable production and consumption in the rural regions remains a barely tried yet important issue for contributing to rural sustainability these days. In particular, the sustainable livelihood of rural farmers has not been fully investigated for those in rural areas with high agricultural pollution emissions and a poor ecological quality of agricultural production in China. Also affected are farmers with a low living standard and output, or suffer from social inequity. The sustainable livelihood security (SLS) index therefore provides a useful means of identifying the existence of the conditions necessary for sustainable livelihood or sustainable development. Using the fuzzy comprehensive method, this paper aims to assess the level of sustainable livelihood security of China's provincial farmers and its three components of ecological security, economic efficiency and social equity. A SLS index is established and the entropy weight method used to determine the weight of the indices and analyze spatial distribution. The results indicate that the sustainable livelihood security index and its components vary between provincial regions, with the western provinces being most adversely affected, sustainable livelihood, economic efficiency and social equity being the least secure (or relatively insecure) in the western provinces while economic efficiency is most secure (or relatively secure) in the eastern and middle provinces, and social equity most secure in the eastern provinces. Concluding remarks suggest policies designed to improve the sustainable livelihood security of farmers according to local regional circumstances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Simulation of the strategic evolution process and interactions between stakeholders in water trading and carbon trading,"Water scarcity and carbon emissions are two of the most pressing issues facing the world. Water rights trading (WRT) and carbon emissions trading (CET) can alleviate pressure on resources and the environment and promote sustainable development. However, the relationship between water scarcity and carbon emissions results in a complex water-carbon nexus between sectors. To explore the mechanisms of interaction among related sectors in the context of WRT and CET, this study built a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes the agriculture, industry, and forestry sectors (AIFSs) to simulate the strategic evolution process and interactions between stakeholders based on replicated dynamic equations. Four cities in the Dongjiang River Basin (DRB) in southern China were analyzed to quantify the influence of key parameters on the strategic evolution process and reveal the relationship between sectors under the effect of WRT and CET. The results indicated that There is a significant impact of agricultural net benefits in the DRB on the choice of AIFS strategy, which in turn leads to better WRT that promotes the mutual coupling of AIFS strategies. In addition, strategy coupling brings higher relative returns and risks to the game system, and multiple markets enable AIFS to hedge losses that may result from single market failures in the mutual game. Furthermore, AIFS' behavioral strategies are not necessarily aligned with market expectations, which has implications for us as we guide the development of WRT and CET. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Spatial equilibrium model-based optimization for inter-regional virtual water pattern within grain trade to relieve water stress,"Realizing water usability and management sustainability represents one of the Sustainable Development Goals. Since grain cultivation consumes tremendous amounts of water, the inter-regional grain trade causes virtual water flow, increasing water stress in certain water-scarce regions. As the second-longest river in China, the Yellow River bears increasingly severe water stress. Considering water and food security, this study proposes a spatial equilibrium model (SEM) that combines partial equilibrium theory and transport models to maximize net social revenue and to balance grain supply and demand, thereby optimizing inter-regional grain trade to relieve water stress. According to different natural, technical and social conditions, we conceived five scenarios to predict regional water stress characterized with different water supplies, demographic structures, food demand compositions and water-saving technologies. Our simulation results suggest that the developed SEM can realize spatial equilibrium of food and water resources within the Basin, which is capable of resolving the problem of food demands in regions with varying extents (13%-55%), optimizing inter-regional grain trade and mitigating water stress. Finally, we recommend some constructive policies for different scenarios to relieve water stress. © 2022 IWA Publishing. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
Constraint-adaptation challenges and resilience transitions of the industry–environmental system in a resource-dependent city,"Resource-dependent cities face the significant challenge of industrial transition under resource and environmental constraints. However, the interplay between industrial and environmental variables and their resilience trajectories have received insufficient attention to date. A constraint–adaptation framework was established to quantify the constraint–adaptation trajectory and resilience transitions of the industry–environmental system in the transition pilot of Baiyin City, western China. In this framework, an environmental performance index (EPI) was employed to reveal constraints of seven resource and environmental variables on local industrial development, combining with industrial indicators (i.e., industrial structure entropy and the shift-share method) to reflect the industrial structure adaptation. The resilience trajectories of seven resource and environmental variables were simulated to depict the industry–environmental system resilience dynamics using the four-phase adaptive cycle theory. Results from 1990 to 2016 in Baiyin City demonstrate that: (1) heavy dependence on mineral and energy resources, and resulting solid waste and atmospheric pollution, undermined local industrial competitiveness; (2) The competitiveness of secondary industry experienced a descending trend since 2011, while the total increase fell dramatically with total deviation of −30.64%; (3) the system underwent a vulnerable resilience transition to great adaptive capacity, with most resilience values greater than 0.5 (ascending adaptive capacity with resilience values from 0 to 1) in the past five years; (4) aggressive transition measures must be adopted to enhance adaptive capacity in the local industry–environmental system and foster co-benefits.

For China to play a leading role in escaping the global environmental crisis, for the benefit of its own population and the rest of the world, technological improvements and the greening of the economy, important as they are, will not suffice. More is needed in terms of limiting resource consumption, namely a reorientation from economic growth towards sustainable consumption and sufficiency. Improving efficiencies on all levels by technological and social innovations is a condition for this, as is a change of consumer aspirations from more to better, towards sufficiency and a good life. Chinese philosophical traditions and values offer anchoring points for such a green enlightenment. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment",About Sufficiency
Zero carbon as economic restructuring: spatial divisions of labour and just transition,"Strategies to reduce carbon emissions are set to be a powerful force of economic restructuring, creating new economic opportunities, and also disruption and divestment for some firms and sectors. A pressing issue for ‘just transitions’ is whether low carbon economic restructuring will challenge or reinforce prevailing geographies of spatial inequality and labour market (dis)advantage. In this article we return to the economic restructuring literature of the 1980s and 1990s to provide a theoretical framework for understanding ‘spatial divisions’ of low carbon work and how they might be shaped to ensure economically just transition. Our approach foregrounds questions of skills, training and pathways to employment across supply chains as key dimensions of just transition, providing a framework for analysis and intervention. The paper, therefore, brings new critical perspectives on low carbon transitions by conceptualising decarbonisation as a form of spatial economic restructuring and its potential implications in reinforcing and/or working against the existing patterns of uneven spatial development. © 2021 The Author(s).

Driving factors to agriculture total factor productivity and its contribution to just energy transition,"This study explores the intricate relationship between agricultural productivity and the pursuit of a just energy transition in China. As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and a nation grappling with environmental degradation and socio-economic disparities, China faces the imperative to transition toward a more sustainable and equitable energy system. This paper investigates the role of agriculture in this transition, recognizing its pivotal position as a significant emitter of greenhouse gases while also being vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. By examining the potential synergies and conflicts between agricultural productivity enhancement and the goals of reducing emissions and promoting social justice, this study aims to shed light on strategies that can effectively align agricultural development with the objectives of a just energy transition. The result indicates substantial internal disparities and strong agglomeration effects (referring to areas with similar agricultural total factor productivity) within China's agricultural total factor productivity distribution. Over the past 17 years (2005–2021), the average agricultural productivity has shown a commendable upward trend, marking a 2.8% growth rate. This increase signifies ongoing efforts and advancements in the agricultural sector, leading to improved productivity levels. Our results also show a significant positive spatial correlation in agricultural total factor productivity, suggesting a tendency for spatial agglomeration. The years 2005 and 2021 stand out as periods marked by significant adverse effects resulting from the interplay of diverse factors on agricultural productivity. By integrating findings from various sectors, this study provides insights into the complex interplay between agriculture and energy transition, emphasizing the need for integrated, holistic approaches that prioritize sustainability, fairness, and resilience in China's pursuit of a just energy future. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",About Sufficiency

The Impact of Energy Poverty Alleviation on Carbon Emissions in Countries along the Belt and Road Initiative,"Energy poverty and climate change are global challenges. While the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has fostered energy cooperation and alleviated energy poverty in BRI countries, its impact on climate change requires careful examination. This study investigates the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions in BRI countries and analyzes the underlying mechanisms. In particular, this study constructs an integrated energy poverty assessment framework that includes three dimensions of energy accessibility, cleanliness, and affordability and utilizes the entropy-TOPSIS method to assess the status of energy poverty in 70 BRI countries. Subsequently, an empirical analysis using the Gini index as an instrumental variable was conducted to explore the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions and the specific mechanisms. It is found that alleviating energy poverty in BRI countries will lead to an increase in per capita carbon emissions. However, improving energy cleanliness is effective in reducing per capita carbon emissions, while improving energy affordability has no significant impact on carbon emissions. This study shows that energy poverty alleviation and carbon emission reduction are two non-conflicting sustainable development goals. BRI countries can synergize energy poverty alleviation and carbon emissions reduction by focusing on clean energy development and providing energy subsidies. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Can Tanzania’s adaptation measures prevent future maize yield decline? A simulation study from Singida region,"Cereal crop production in sub-Saharan Africa has not achieved the much-needed increase in yields to foster economic development and food security. Maize yields in the region’s semi-arid agroecosystems are constrained by highly variable rainfall, which may be worsened by climate change. Thus, the Tanzanian government has prioritized agriculture as an adaptation sector in its intended nationally determined contribution, and crop management adjustments as a key investment area in its Agricultural Sector Development Programme. In this study, we investigated how future changes in maize yields under different climate scenarios can be countered by regional adjusted crop management and cultivar adaptation strategies. A crop model was used to simulate maize yields in the Singida region of Tanzania for the baseline period 1980–2012 and under three future climate projections for 2020–2060 and 2061–2099. Adaptation strategies to improve yields were full irrigation, deficit irrigation, mulch and nitrogen addition and another cultivar. According to our model results, increase in temperature is the main driver of future maize yield decline. Increased respiration and phenological development were associated with lower maize yields of 16% in 2020–2060 and 20% in 2061–2099 compared to the 1980–2012 baseline. Surprisingly, none of the management strategies significantly improved yields; however, a different maize variety that was tested as an alternative coping strategy performed better. This study suggests that investment in accessibility of improved varieties and investigation of maize traits that have the potential to perform well in a warmer future are better suited for sustaining maize production in the semi-arid region than adjustments in crop management. © 2021, The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
Towards an EU regulatory framework for climate-smart agriculture: The example of soil carbon sequestration,"This article assesses current and proposed European Union (EU) climate and environmental law, and the legal instruments associated with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), to see whether soil carbon sequestration is sufficiently promoted as a promising example of 'climate-smart agriculture'. The assessment shows that current and proposed policies and instruments are inadequate to stimulate large-scale adoption of soil carbon projects across Europe. Given the identified structural flaws, it is likely that this is true for all climate-smart agricultural practices. An alternative approach needs to be developed. Under EU climate policy, agriculture should be included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) by allowing regulated industries to buy offsets from the agricultural sector, following the examples set by Australia and others. The second element of a new approach is aimed at the CAP, which needs to be far more focused on the specific requirements of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet, such stronger focus does not take away the need to explore new income streams for farmers from offsets under the ETS, as the CAP will never have sufficient funds for the deep and full transition of Europe's agriculture sector that is needed. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.",About Sufficiency

The results provide evidence for this relationship but its strength varies between behavioral domains – that is, heating, electricity, food consumption, everyday mobility, air travel. Potential structural and individual barriers to reducing CO2 emissions are discussed as possible factors that could explain differences between the behavioral domains.

Approaches to responsible sourcing in mineral supply chains,"Over the last decade, ‘responsible sourcing’ has become a topic of broad interest. Policymakers, consumers and companies refer to ‘responsible sourcing’ as a way to address sustainability risks in globalized mineral supply chains, but the term is used to refer to a wide range of sustainability objectives pursued by a variety of approaches. To address the need for a definition and structuring of the topic, a review was performed of the existing literature and of company policies on ‘responsible sourcing’ of minerals. The study develops a framework for responsible sourcing, here defined as ‘the management of social, environmental and/or economic sustainability in the supply chain through production data’. We propose that ‘responsible sourcing’ should be used as an umbrella term encompassing all sourcing designed to be ‘socially responsible’ ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’. Two approaches to managing responsible sourcing of minerals were identified: supply chain due diligence and sourcing via sustainability schemes. This study maps the sustainability requirements of such schemes and uses these to categorize them as socially responsible sourcing, sustainable sourcing or green sourcing. It also identifies the extent in the supply chain to which the schemes provide assurance or certification and how far traceability extends. The study provides a framework for future research and a springboard for further development of approaches to responsible sourcing that can be used by both companies and academics. © 2019 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency
Transition Pathway Palm Oil Research Framework Toward a Bio-Circular-Green Economy Model Using SWOT Analysis: A Case Study of Thailand,"Climate change, food security, and energy crisis are becoming more intense in our world. Oil palm can be utilized in both the food and biofuel industries. To respond to the crisis, it is necessary to develop palm oil products besides vegetable oil and biodiesel. This article focuses on the development of strategies to research oil palm throughout the supply chain in Thailand. The SWOT factors (the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) are recognized via interviews with stakeholders. These stakeholders are feedstock producers, crude palm oil (CPO) producers, government agencies, biodiesel producers, palm oil refinery producers, and researchers. The results obtained from the data collection were analyzed and led to the formulation of strategies for future research on oil palm by the TOWS matrix. According to this analysis, future palm oil research framework strategies should consist of four categories: (1) oil palm management policy, developing regulation and economic instruments of various forms to systematically manage the oil palm industry, and applying big data and smart innovation to analyze market behavior; (2) oil palm breeding and production technologies, developing smart innovation in line with farmers’ lifestyles, and supporting research on oil content analysis and harvesting technology; (3) oil palm biomass conversion technologies, assessing environmental impacts through life cycle technology, evaluating the potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing the consumption rate of palm biomass; and (4) palm-based oleochemical products, developing oleochemical technology at the industrial level, expanding the potential capacity of producing oleochemical derivative products, and increasing the consumption rate and value added of CPO. All four frameworks were detailed and revised in line with the information obtained from seminars, comments, and interviews to meet the needs of all stakeholders. This framework will help drive the Bio-Circular-Green economy model in the future. Copyright © 2022 Usapein, Tuntiwiwattanapun, Polburee, Veerakul, Seekao and Chavalparit.",About Sufficiency

A lack of clarity persists, however, on what fair and equitable benefit-sharing requires and entails, and whether its implementation supports or eventually undermines equity and justice. This book examines these questions in the area of land, food and agriculture, addressing for the first time several instances of the agricultural production chain, including research and development, land governance and land use and access to markets. It identifies challenges regarding implementation of the concept as enshrined in environmental treaties and soft-law instruments, with a focus on the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, the Voluntary Guidelines on Tenure and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants. It investigates its role, enabling conditions and limitations, in a contradictory policy context involving environmental, food security and human rights objectives but also a growing web of multilateral and bilateral trade and investment agreements. Linking international law research with a socio-legal analysis, the book addresses four grassroots examples, which offer ideas for institutional and legal innovation from the local to the global level. This interdisciplinary title will be of great interest to students and scholars of international environmental law, agriculture, land law, development studies and global governance, as well as policymakers and practitioners working in these fields.

A Framework to Evaluate the Social Life Cycle Impact of Products under the Circular Economy Thinking,"Today, the circular economy is regarded as a promising alternative for modern economies to preserve “virgin” natural resources for future generations by valorizing waste materials. The concept is also used to promote the goals of sustainable development, where, apart from the environmental dimension, the economic and social dimensions are also integrated. So far, the largest part of the related research has emphasized the environmental and economic dimensions, while little attention has been paid to the social dimension of circular economy. Thus, this paper develops a framework to evaluate the social impacts of circular products and materials throughout their life cycle, which is based on social life thinking, circular economy principles and strategies and social responsibility principles. Moreover, computational examples are presented to show the functionality and applicability of the proposed framework. Finally, critical points for future research are pinpointed in order to assist scholars in applying and improving such frameworks through case studies, helping them to better understand the social aspects of circular economy. © 2022 by the authors.

The potential contribution of growing rapeseed in winter fallow fields across Yangtze River Basin to energy and food security in China,"To solve the energy crisis and protect the ecological environment has been the central concern of the sustainable development debate. The reproducibility and lower environmental impacts of bioenergy have attracted increasing attention in the debate. This research investigates the potentials of growing rapeseed in winter fallow fields across the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) to serve the goal of boosting bioenergy production and improving edible oil security in China. It first quantifies the extent of winter fallow fields in the Basin and identifies the accurate starting and ending dates of the fallowing at the grid-cell level. It then matches the fallowing periods with the growing period grid-by-grid and assesses the current and future potentials of rapeseed production across the matched grid-cells in the region. The assessments take into consideration of climate change adaptations on sowing dates and on the choice of varieties with suitable growth cycle length. Finally, by coupling the Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ) model and CHINAGRO-II economic model, this research simulates economically meaningful levels of rapeseeds production and trade for 2020 and 2030. A 60% realization of the production potential would increase total rapeseed supply by 9.1 million tons, reduce China's rapeseed import to zero and further reduce soybean import by 8.1 million tons in 2020. In 2030, the import of rapeseed would be reduced from 15 million tons under baseline to 7.3 million tons. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Evidence supporting cap and trade as a groundwater policy option for reducing irrigation consumptive use,"In the American West water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource. Obligations to bordering states, endangered species protection, and long-term resource sustainability objectives have created a need for most western states to reduce the consumption of irrigation water. In Nebraska specifically, the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources (NDNR) and local Natural Resource Districts (NRDs) are meeting a large part of this need by using a regulatory approach, commonly called groundwater allocation. The cost of allocation, which occurs in the form of reduced economic returns to irrigation, could be greatly reduced by using an integrated cap and trade approach. Much like environmental cap and trade programs which are used to reduce the cost of limiting environmental pollution, the trading of capped groundwater allocations can reduce the cost of limiting water use. In an analysis of a typical case in the Nebraska Republican Basin, we found that the impact of a water market to trade groundwater allocations depended on the size of the allocation and on the characteristics of the land and irrigation systems involved in the trade. Potential economic benefits from trade ranged from US$0 to US$120 per 1,000 cubic meters traded, from US$25 to US$250 per 1,000 cubic meters of reduction in consumptive use, and from US$16 to US$50 per hectare of irrigated land in the region. The highest benefits occurred at relatively high allocations, which capped withdrawals at 65-75% of the expected unrestricted pumping level. These gains from trade would be split between buyers and sellers based on the negotiated selling price. © 2009 American Water Resources Association.",About Sufficiency
Impact of South Asia on global institutions: Economic and social perspectives,"The economic and leadership importance of South Asia is rising as the centre of global economy is shifting towards Asia from the west. This growing importance provides an opportune crossroads for South Asia to meet the challenges of poverty, peace and environmental degradation that is facing its region and the world, and increase its economic and political standing in the global economy. For its economic standing, economic integration is of the utmost importance, as it will enable South Asia to rival China economically and it will account for one of the largest trading blocks in the world. South Asia is made up of eight nations, along with seven South Asian Association Regional Co-operation (SAARC) states and Afghanistan. Recent evidence indicates that South Asia has shown strong growth over the past decade. In Table 18.1, it is clear that India is leading the growth by doubling its GDP from US$478 billion in 2001 to nearly US$911.2 in 2006. However, South Asia is the home to over one-�?fth of the global population living in an area half the size of China. It has the largest concentration of the world’s poor in absolute terms. In 2004 there were an estimated 445.6 million who lived below US$1 a day and 1,115.3 million people who lived below US$2 a day, which comprised nearly 30.8 per cent and 77.1 per cent of the total population respectively (see Table 18.2). The incidence of poverty is much higher in South Asia compared with East Asia and the Paci�?c and Latin America and the Caribbean. Given its sheer size South Asia could play an important role in poverty reduction. The number of people who live on less than US$1 a day declined between 1999 and 2004, suggesting some poverty alleviation (Table 18.2). Despite high growth for the past decade in some South Asian countries, the prevalence of poverty indicates the extent of income inequality in the region. Its health conditions are also quite diverse with, for example, one of the highest proportions of underweight children in the world. In terms of education, Pakistan has one of the lowest primary school enrolment ratios in the whole of Asia Paci�?c region. In Bangladesh, the Maldives and Pakistan the enrolment in secondary schools is low compared with primary school enrolment (Table 18.3). Despite positive steps being taken for widespread primary education and targeted programmes for secondary education in South Asia, there exists wide gaps across countries in enrolment ratios between females and males. © 2011 Raghbendra Jha.

Trading the economic value of unsatisfied municipal water demand,"Modelling and optimization techniques for water resources allocation are proposed to identify the economic value of the unsatisfied municipal water demand against demands emerging from other sectors. While this is always an important step in integrated water resource management perspective, it became crucial for water scarce Countries. In fact, since the competition for the resource is high, they are in crucial need to trade values which will help them in satisfying their policies and needs. In this framework, hydro-economic, social equity and environmental constraints need to be satisfied. In the present study, a hydro-economic decision model based on optimization schemes has been developed for water resources allocation, that enable the evaluation of the economic cost of a deficiency in fulfilling the municipal demand. Moreover, the model enables efficient water resources management, satisfying the demand and proposing additional water resources options. The formulated model is designed to maximize the demand satisfaction and minimize water production cost subject to system priorities, preferences and constraints. The demand priorities are defined based on the effect of demand dissatisfaction, while hydrogeological and physical characteristics of the resources are embedded as constraints in the optimization problem. The application to the City of Amman is presented. Amman is the Capital City of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, a Country located in the south-eastern area of the Mediterranean, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. The main challenge for Jordan, that threat the development and prosperity of all sectors, is the extreme water scarcity. In fact, Jordan is classified as semi-arid to arid region with limited financial resources and unprecedented population growth. While the easy solution directly goes to the simple but expensive approach to cover the demand, case study results show that the proposed model plays a major role in providing directions to decision makers to orient their policies and strategies in order to achieve sustainability of scarce water resources, satisfaction of the minimum required demand as well as financial sustainability. In addition, results map out national needs and priorities that are crucial in understanding and controlling the complexity of Jordan's water sector, mainly for the city of Amman. © Author(s) 2018.",About Sufficiency
An ecosystem services framework to support both practical conservation and economic development,"The core idea of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is that the human condition is tightly linked to environmental condition. This assertion suggests that conservation and development projects should be able to achieve both ecological and social progress without detracting from their primary objectives. Whereas ""win-win"" projects that achieve both conservation and economic gains are a commendable goal, they are not easy to attain. An analysis of World Bank projects with objectives of alleviating poverty and protecting biodiversity revealed that only 16% made major progress on both objectives. Here, we provide a framework for anticipating win-win, lose-lose, and win-lose outcomes as a result of how people manage their ecosystem services. This framework emerges from detailed explorations of several case studies in which biodiversity conservation and economic development coincide and cases in which there is joint failure. We emphasize that scientific advances around ecosystem service production functions, tradeoffs among multiple ecosystem services, and the design of appropriate monitoring programs are necessary for the implementation of conservation and development projects that will successfully advance both environmental and social goals. The potentially bright future of jointly advancing ecosystem services, conservation, and human well-being will be jeopardized unless a global monitoring effort is launched that uses the many ongoing projects as a grand experiment. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",About Sufficiency
Climate-resilient irrigation: Essential changes to balance food production and water security on a livable planet,"Climate-resilient irrigation is a necessity for sustainable development, aligning with broader goals of poverty alleviation, food security and environmental stewardship. By embracing adaptive strategies and fostering collaborative efforts, communities can navigate the challenges posed by a changing climate, safeguarding livelihoods and ecosystems. Climate-resilient irrigation can improve coping measures and build resilience for communities through pathways which help improve agriculture. The relationship between agriculture, irrigation, water resources and climate change calls for an evolution of traditional irrigation practices towards climate-resilient irrigation approaches, such as farmer-led irrigation development; innovation and modernization to ensure the long-term viability and functionality of irrigation systems and infrastructure; financing mechanisms to support the transition towards climate resilience; partnerships between governments, international organizations and the private sector to mobilize resources effectively; and efficient service delivery mechanisms, promoting equitable access and effective management of water resources. Emphasizing the need climate-resilient irrigation to balance food production and water security, this essay advocates a paradigm shift towards sustainable water management, ensuring resilience in the face of climate uncertainties while safeguarding agricultural productivity and environmental integrity for a livable planet. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Africa’s game changers and the catalysts of social and system innovation,"It is widely recognized that many African economies are being transformed by rapid economic growth driven largely by rising demand for the abundant natural resources scattered across the African continent. I critically review the mainstream gamechanging dynamics driving this process, with special reference to a set of influential policy-oriented documents. This is followed by an analysis of less-recognized game-changing dynamics that have, in turn, been affected by the mainstream game-changing dynamics. These less-recognized game-changing dynamics include energy infrastructure challenges in a context of climate change, securing access to water, access to arable soils, slum urbanism, and food security responses. These mainstream and less-recognized game-changing dynamics provide the context for analyzing a range of African actor networks engaged in social and system innovations. I use a transdisciplinary framework to discuss these actor networks and how they construct their understanding of the game changers affecting their programs and actions. Based on a case study of the iShack initiative in Stellenbosch, South Africa, I conclude that social and system innovations will need to be driven by transformation knowledge co-produced by researchers and social actors who can actively link game-changing dynamics that operate at multiple scales with local-level innovations with potential societal impacts. © 2016 by the author(s).",About Sufficiency
"A low GHG development pathway design framework for agriculture, forestry and land use","Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) represent 22% of global greenhouse gas emissions. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, the AFOLU sector greenhouse gases must be dramatically reduced and eventually transformed to net negative CO2e within this century. The decarbonisation choices will have significant environmental, social and economic impacts, yet few analytical frameworks exist able to account holistically for AFOLU mitigation strategies and their sustainable development impacts in a way that combines advantages of global and national approaches to decarbonisation pathways. This paper proposes a pathway design framework for AFOLU decarbonisation strategies that can help governments set targets across four types of levers (increasing sequestration; improving the emissions efficiency of agriculture; incentivising dietary changes; and displacing fossil fuels with bioenergy) and help them navigate potential synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development objectives (notably food security, biodiversity preservation, poverty alleviation and job creation), in a way that facilitates co-construction and discussion with main stakeholders. © 2021 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Sustainable green circular economic model with controllable waste and emission in healthcare system,"In the growing economy, the transport sector emerges as the primary generator of the most prevalent greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The medical sector is witnessing a significant expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) to uncover health insights and in transportation sectors to avoid traffic congestion. In general, truck transportations cause delay in deliveries and it emits more carbon. In the context of rural healthcare, the improper delivery of medicinal drugs and surgical equipment has resulted in disruptions for patients. To precise these issues and to promote sustainability, this study aimed to design a circular inventory system to control the waste through circular economy practices, reduce emissions by investing in AI technology, green technology, source reduction technology. Thus, this study uses AI-Drone transportation as an alternative to traditional truck-based delivery system for fast delivery and to reduce carbon foot prints. Green technology reduces anthropogenic GHG emissions by controlling the carbon under the carbon tax and carbon allowance system. This study employs reverse logistics to collect and remanufacture the waste and damaged items. Rather than landfilling, recycling of medical waste reduces emission and waste while conserving resources. Drones equipped with an AI smart capsule track the location and monitor the temperature of certain medical commodities. Taking this into consideration, Baghmara healthcare is used as a case study to develop the model and analyse the necessity of drone deliveries. This research is crucial to provide a support to people in rural areas with the fastest resources during emergency medical crises. Altogether, the study utilizes an appropriate algorithm to generate the optimal profit and ordering quantity for the buyer, manufacturer and integrated total profit by improving efficiency in emission reduction and waste reduction. Numerical and sensitivity analysis is demonstrated graphically using origin software to depict the impact on total profit and ordering quantity. This study can be concluded with the implementation of these 4 technologies, and with the government support, medical product supply chain can sustain with green environment and be profitable for all the participants in that chain. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",About Sufficiency
From manufacturing-led export growth to a twenty-first century inclusive growth strategy: Explaining the demise of a successful growth model and what to do about it,"Success in economic development over the past half-century was based on manufacturing-led export growth. Because the share of global employment in manufacturing is set to continue to decline, manufacturing will not play the same role in the future. The author deconstructs what enabled manufacturing to generate growth and structural transformation. The strategy proposed is multi-pronged, addressing separately, in different sectors, the challenges of learning, foreign exchange, and employment. A carefully designed, coordinated multi-sector strategy, with sectoral policies in agriculture, natural resources, manufacturing, and especially services, has the prospect of attaining the same success as the old manufacturing-led export strategy. To implement it, countries will require active industrial policies based on a new understanding of dynamic comparative advantage. The creation of a global reserve system could help provide the finance required for success. New development strategies will require greater balance among the market, state, and community-a perspective articulated in the Stockholm Statement. © United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER) 2021.",About Sufficiency
Harnessing international finance to manage the Amazon agro-industrial explosion? The case of international finance corporation loans to Grupo Maggi,"One of the major global trends linked to the process of globalization is the expansion of agro-industry into the humid tropics. Although agro-industry is an important source of income for Brazil, it is also leading to the displacement of local populations and extensive clearing of native vegetation. In this context, we focus on a second trend resulting from globalization in which financial institutions have demonstrated increasing concern with environmental and social responsibility, notably through the inclusion of environmental and social conditions in loans to the agricultural sector. In this article, we provide an assessment of the potential for this type of economic instrument to help reduce the negative impacts of agro-industrial expansion, and how the different actors who are shaping this debate (non-governmental organizations, industries, the finance sector, government) can best help to realize this potential. We evaluate this broader question through the lens of two International Finance Corporation loans to Brazil's Grupo Maggi, the world's largest independently-held soybean exporter. We identify four areas in which private sector self-regulation can improve to realize environmental and social performance goals: (a) Financial institutions and firms can increase the clarity, quality, timeliness, and regularity of monitoring and reporting; (b) Civil society can develop a more sophisticated approach to distinguishing between companies and initiatives that essentially maintain the status quo and those that are trying to improve; (c) Civil society can help to develop simple, standard measures of environmental and social performance of agricultural lands for use by financial institutions and firms in establishing environmental and social management systems; and (d) Governments can develop strong regulations that capitalize on voluntary regulation mechanisms' flexibility and efficiency, as well as developing incentive systems for producers and firms that demonstrate high social and environmental performance in their operations. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

14 - Strengthening Green Finance by Better Integrating the Social Dimensions in the European Union’s Sustainable Finance Laws,"The EU has spearheaded innovative legislation in 2019 to promote the financing of economic activities to tackle climate change. But the social aspects of tackling climate and environmental problems have received inadequate attention in the legislation. This has resulted in inconsistent legal definitions and unelaborated processes to ensure all economic and climate tackling activities are socially sustainable. In many cases climate changing activities have resulted from, or been combined with, breaching social and human rights. Providing opportunities to citizens and communities to (financially) redress environmental problems is important for a just transition. An integrated approach whereby ESG risks and long term impacts are integrated in all banking and investment decision-making should be urgently taken up by the Commission. Building on existing international standards, voluntary codes and expertise in the EU’s social sector would help to meet the existing challenges. Such EU policy should also be integrated in the EU’s international trade and investment treaties that create the competition from financial players outside the EU which might not integrate an ESG approach. © Cambridge University Press 2021.",About Sufficiency
The new politics of strategic resources: Energy and food security challenges in the 21st century,"Since 2008, energy and food markets ?those most fundamental to human existence ?have remained in turmoil. Resource scarcity has had a much bigger global impact in recent years than has been predicted, with ongoing volatility a sign that the world is only part-way through navigating a treacherous transition in the way it uses resources. Scarcity, and perceptions of scarcity, increase political risks, while geopolitical turmoil exacerbates shortages and complicates the search for solutions. The New Politics of Strategic Resources examines the political dimensions of strategic resource challenges at the domestic and international levels. For better or worse, energy and food markets are shaped by perceptions of national interest and do not behave as traditional market goods. So while markets are an essential part of any response to tighter resource supplies, governments also will play a key role. David Steven, Emily O'Brien, Bruce Jones, and their colleagues discuss what those roles are and what they should be. The architecture for coordinating multilateral responses to these dynamics has fallen short, raising questions about the effective international management of these issues. Politics impede here too, as the major powers must negotiate political and security trade-offs to cooperate on the design of more robust international regimes and mechanisms for resource security and the provision of global public goods. This timely volume includes chapters on major powers (United States, India, China) and key suppliers (Russia, Saudi Arabia).

Your money or your life? The carbon-development paradox,"The relationship between human health and well-being, energy use and carbon emissions is a foremost concern in sustainable development. If past advances in well-being have been accomplished only through increases in energy use, there may be significant trade-offs between achieving universal human development and mitigating climate change. We test the explanatory power of economic, dietary and modern energy factors in accounting for past improvements in life expectancy, using a simple novel method, functional dynamic decomposition. We elucidate the paradox that a strong correlation between emissions and human development at one point in time does not imply that their dynamics are coupled in the long term. Increases in primary energy and carbon emissions can account for only a quarter of improvements in life expectancy, but are closely tied to growth in income. Facing this carbon-development paradox requires prioritizing human well-being over economic growth. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Biomaterials and Regenerative Agriculture: A Methodological Framework to Enable Circular Transitions,"Biomaterials, used here to signify 100% biobased and biodegradable materials, can offer a promising solution for transitioning away from fossil-based resources, addressing the climate crisis, and combating plastic pollution. To ensure their environmental benefits, biomaterials must derive from regenerative, non-polluting feedstocks that do not compete with food or feed production. From this perspective, agricultural residues and by-products present a favorable feedstock option for biomaterials production. Although this is an improvement over sourcing them from primary crops, the sustainability of underlying agricultural systems must be considered. Furthermore, the nutrient value of biomaterials for specific soil ecosystems is often overlooked despite their compostability. In this research, we investigate the linkages between biomaterials development and regenerative agriculture, a set of farming practices that can effectively sustain the growing human population while enhancing, rather than degrading, ecosystem health. We explore interdependencies between biomaterials’ production and regenerative agriculture for biomass sourcing and nutrient return and suggest a methodological framework to identify mutual benefits. The extent to which regenerative farms can provide biomaterial feedstocks without compromising crop cultivation and ecosystem health is analyzed together with the potential of biomaterials to deliver beneficial nutrients and services to regenerative systems. Applying this framework to the Great Lakes Region, Michigan, USA, an agricultural hub facing environmental degradation and plastic pollution, reveals synergistic linkages that unlock novel circular economy opportunities, including local production of renewable biomaterials for various applications, enhancing food security and bolstering socio-ecological systems. © 2023 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
The future of wheat breeding,"Unlike the situation in the European Union, where wheat breeding is almost exclusively in the hands of the private sector, public breeding of disease-resistant wheat with high baking quality has a long-standing tradition in Switzerland. Important increases in yield potential are still possible here. After World War I, wheat yield in other European countries increased rapidly due to a focus on mass production and a demand for high baking quality. The current annual breeding progress in mass-produced wheat remains at 1%, and large investments would be necessary to raise this rate to the 2.5% required for global food security. However, investment does not pay back when seed rotation is reduced to 50% as it is the case in some countries. Therefore, significant yield leaps cannot be expected in the near future. As the harvest index-the driving trait of the Green Revolution-is close to its theoretical maximum above 50% and thus no longer drives progress, smart-breeding may allow fast and precise breeding. Smartbreeding combines cheap and efficient molecular tools with new phenotyping techniques to produce novel varieties, such as hexaploid bread wheat. The theoretical possibility of doubling the photosynthetic efficiency is a silver line at the horizon, but it demands fundamental changes to an age-old breeding system. In the face of climate change and ongoing globalization, the reasonable use of new breeding tools will help us develop new productive wheat varieties that are tolerant to rapid changes from hot to cold or flooding to drought and are resistant to pests and diseases.",About Sufficiency
New challenges for the moroccan agricultural sector to cope with local and global changes,"The Moroccan agricultural sector is facing emerging challenges. First, the country is characterized by a significant water stress, as the volume of renewable water per capita does not exceed 750cubic meters per year. In addition, climate change scenarios predict a decrease by 10 to 15% of average rainfall and a rise of 2°C in temperatures over the next decades. As a consequence, water scarcity will be exacerbated. Second, the current national agricultural strategy, namely the ‘Green Morocco Plan’, aims to increase the overall production of the agricultural sector. To do so, public authorities encourage the adoption of drip irrigation coupled with financial support for drilling boreholes and for pumping` equipment, e.g., to irrigate fruit trees and vegetables. As a consequence, in many areas of the country, groundwater depletion is of growing concern. Third, domestic markets have become saturated and fruit prices have plummeted, particularly citrus, hindering the original hypothesis of improved economic water productivity by horticultural crops. Moreover, the current agricultural strategy has neglected rain-fed staple crops, such as cereals and pulses, and farmers growing these crops receive limited support. Fourth, the whole economic growth of the country appears to remain highly vulnerable to the annual rainfall variability. Because of demographic growth, the country has become a net importer of food and feed, e.g., soft wheat, edible oils, dairy products (butter and cheese), maize, and soya meal, and this may be harmful for its food security. Fifth, Morocco remains a rural country, since 40% of its inhabitants are still considered as employed in the agricultural sector. This is already generating increased tensions on agricultural land. In particular, the numerous land tenure statuses often impede investments in agricultural activities that would be made on the long term. Despite these challenges, the growing domestic demand for food products constitutes a strong opportunity for improved livelihoods for the people employed in this sector. As a consequence, young farmers engage in innovative learning processes in order to achieve higher crops and livestock yields, as well as improved farms’ profitability. Altogether, these elements suggest that the Moroccan agricultural sector will need to actively face new challenges, especially in relation to water management in a context of climate change, sound extension services and improved labor remuneration, as well as the satisfaction of growing food demand. These challenges may require new governance standards, which impose not only to produce higher quantities of food products but also of better quality and to do so in an environmentally sustainable way. Priority should be hence set to capacity-building of human resources and to promoting rain-fed systems that integrate crops and livestock rather than focusing only on support to heavy investments in irrigation, with limited attention to market and environmental issues. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",About Sufficiency
"Estimating the impact on water scarcity due to coffee production, trade, and consumption worldwide and a focus on EU","Coffee consumption is concentrated in the “Global North”, while production is mainly located in the “Global South”. This trade-driven dependency leads to the exploitation of natural resources. As an export-oriented cash crop, such dependency jeopardizes the existence of a fair distribution of the risks and revenues among all the actors taking part in its globalized supply chain. Coffee trees are mainly rain-fed and only partly irrigated. However, the increasing global coffee demand led to higher consumption of freshwater, which can exacerbate the stressed condition of already stressed water basins. This study quantifies the impact of global coffee consumption on water scarcity, considering the larger system made of producer and consumer countries. The global displacement of such impact is driven by consumer preferences. We found that the US, EU and Asian countries’ coffee consumption create impact on water scarcity mostly in African and South American countries, which is also representative of the economic disparities existing behind the global trade flows. Climate change will likely affect the varieties currently preferred by global consumers. Therefore, immediate environmental sustainability actions including water resource preservation are necessary to face current and future challenges. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
"Conservation in conflict: Corporations, capitalism and sustainable development","In recent times arguments for conservation allying with corporations have been prominent and not least in the advocacy of ‘new conservation’. This has set up a false dichotomy between traditional conservation and concern for humanity. The supposed intrinsic/instrumental, human/non-human conflict in conservation appears as a diversion from the actual problem which is the modern organisation of society as a capital accumulating machine based on competition and shifting costs on to others. This is particularly evident in the corporate and financial forms of capitalism which have been taking over conservation, and more broadly environmental policy debates. Pragmatism in the form of ‘new conservation’ is argued to involve contradictions going back to Pinchot and encapsulated in modern ideas of sustainable development. This has accelerated environmental destruction and social inequity, exploitation and injustice. The loss of biodiversity will accelerate with the financialisation of Nature via a range of new instruments (e.g. biodiversity banking, trading, offsetting, green/blue bonds, species credits, extinction futures markets and climate catastrophe bonds) that are being promoted by major conservation NGOs (e.g. WWF, TNC). Preserving, empowering and developing alternative social-ecological forms of running economies is then seen as the central issue for protecting both humans and non-humans alike. Divisions in conservation are argued to be real conflicts over the form and function of economic systems and the currently dominant role of capitalism in its corporate and financial forms. © 2022",About Sufficiency
Impact assessment as a means to train future engineers for sustainable development,"Today's engineers are not only expected to develop new products and technical solutions to everyday problems.

Contribution of waste management to a sustainable textile sector,"With increasing textile consumption and limited sorting and recycling capacities, the EU faces major challenges in terms of managing its textile waste. This study investigates the environmental and socio-economic impacts of explorative policy scenarios for a more sustainable textile waste management system in Europe. These scenarios differ substantially in the amounts of textile waste generated and separately collected, closed-loop recycling capacities and textile waste exports. Our results show that sustainable textile waste management remains highly relevant for the sector. Still, without addressing in parallel prevention of textile waste generation via production and consumption patterns, a climate-neutral and circular textiles sector will be hard to achieve. Interventions in the waste management of textiles could reduce global warming impacts by up to 22.3 Mt CO2 per year, which translates to an 18% sector-wide impact by 2035. Depending on the intervention(s), the estimated required investment at present amounts to between 7 and 33 billion EUR.

EU climate and energy policy beyond 2020: Is a single target for GHG reduction sufficient?,"The immediate and long-term requirements of energy policy in Germany and the wider EU are widespread. In addition to meeting decarbonisation targets to mitigate climate change, energy policy must be designed in such a way that is socioeconomically advantageous, delivering multi-policy objectives of energy security, a stable environment for energy system operation, affordable energy prices for consumers and industry, and an environment conducive to economic growth. There has been much debate about the merits and weaknesses of alternative policy frameworks to deliver on emissions targets. Introduced in 2005, the EU emissions trading system (ETS) was designed to monetise the externalities associated with GHG emissions, with many citing the carbon price as providing the most efficient and cost-effective means of achieving a certain emissions target. By contrast, subsidies for renewable electricity generation and energy efficiency measures, when implemented alongside an emissions trading scheme, are often criticized for increasing the costs of emissions abatement and producing no additional environmental benefits. This chapter re-assesses the merits and weaknesses of this policy mix and explores the socio-economic impacts of alternative policy scenarios that achieve the same emissions target. We use E3ME, a global macro-econometric model, to show that environmental regulation and subsidies for energy efficiency and renewable investment at European level, when implemented alongside a carbon price, lead to improved long-term environmental and socio-economic outcomes compared to when a carbon price is the sole policy instrument. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",About Sufficiency
How much land-based greenhouse gas mitigation can be achieved without compromising food security and environmental goals?,"Feeding 9-10 billion people by 2050 and preventing dangerous climate change are two of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Both challenges must be met while reducing the impact of land management on ecosystem services that deliver vital goods and services, and support human health and well-being. Few studies to date have considered the interactions between these challenges. In this study we briefly outline the challenges, review the supply- and demand-side climate mitigation potential available in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use AFOLU sector and options for delivering food security. We briefly outline some of the synergies and trade-offs afforded by mitigation practices, before presenting an assessment of the mitigation potential possible in the AFOLU sector under possible future scenarios in which demand-side measures codeliver to aid food security. We conclude that while supply-side mitigation measures, such as changes in land management, might either enhance or negatively impact food security, demand-side mitigation measures, such as reduced waste or demand for livestock products, should benefit both food security and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Demand-side measures offer a greater potential (1.5-15.6 Gt CO2-eq. yr-1) in meeting both challenges than do supply-side measures (1.5-4.3 Gt CO2-eq. yr-1 at carbon prices between 20 and 100 US$ tCO2-eq. yr-1), but given the enormity of challenges, all options need to be considered. Supply-side measures should be implemented immediately, focussing on those that allow the production of more agricultural product per unit of input. For demand-side measures, given the difficulties in their implementation and lag in their effectiveness, policy should be introduced quickly, and should aim to codeliver to other policy agenda, such as improving environmental quality or improving dietary health. These problems facing humanity in the 21st Century are extremely challenging, and policy that addresses multiple objectives is required now more than ever. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Energy transition as a way to improve the welfare of Indonesian society,"The shift towards energy is now a priority in Indonesia's efforts to promote sustainable development. With a growing recognition of the effects of climate change and the limitations of energy sources, the urgency to transition to clean and renewable energy options is on the rise. This study aims to investigate how transitioning to energy can enhance the well-being of communities. We aim to highlight critical insights by examining and thoroughly reviewing the literature. Firstly, ensuring energy practices is crucial for attaining development objectives. Energy plays a role in providing services like electricity, transportation, and household heating. Secondly, challenges related to infrastructure and energy accessibility remain hurdles in Indonesia's journey towards an energy transition. Despite advancements in energy initiatives, many remote areas still need access to electricity. Lastly, governmental intervention plays a role in steering a transition towards sustainable energy solutions. Private sector investment in renewable energy sources must be supported and directed through relatively strict policies, fiscal incentives, and regulations. Finally, the energy transition is an essential social and economic event, and appropriate policies need to be developed to promote a just transition and ensure the best outcomes for all stakeholders and society. To conclude, the energy transition in Indonesia requires a combination of government, private sector, civil society, and international stakeholder involvement. By working together across sectors, investing in renewable energy gen technology, and implementing advanced policies, Indonesia promotes transitioning to a more sustainable energy system and improving the overall welfare of society. © 2024, Malque Publishing.

Technology adoption and weed emergence dynamics: social ecological modeling for maize-legume systems across Africa,"Ecological practices such as intercropping maize (Zea mays) with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) have been promoted to combat parasitic weeds like Striga (Striga asiatica). Intercropping has been promoted across Africa as a Striga control practice (SCP) and food security measure. Despite past efforts, millions of smallholder farmers (cultivating < 2 ha of maize) still struggle to implement SCPs. Social and ecological factors that prevent SCP implementation are well documented in the literature, but their underlying interactions have remained elusive. System dynamics modeling can uncover these interactions and assess their effect on intercropping rates as well as Striga emergence. This study presents a participatory mixed methods approach to build a system dynamics model based on two theories: diffusion of innovations and resource pool dynamics. The model estimates the population of fields where Striga emerged in response to intercropped fields when various interventions were implemented. According to model simulations, if new policies are not enacted to support intercropping, Striga is likely to spread to 2,625,000 maize fields, parasitizing almost 75% of smallholder farms across Central Malawi by 2036. The participatory approach allowed us to evaluate several policies, one of which sustained enough adopters to limit Striga emergence to < 500,000 fields, reducing the weed’s threat to food security. This policy considers how input costs and erratic rainfall can lead to disadoption, therefore, supporting the implementation of five to six consecutive years of intercropping by providing both fertilizer subsidies and demonstration plots. In this study, our participatory approach has shown to develop a model that can highlight interactions in social ecological systems, their leverage points, and how they can be exploited to develop effective food security policies. © 2024 by the author(s).",About Sufficiency
Pathways to meeting climate goals with clean and affordable energy,"Successfully managing climate change will require a broad policy focus that encourages the adoption and implementation of all viable net-zero pathways. Solutions that focus on the elimination of hydrocarbon fuels, rather than on managing green-house gas emissions, could have enormous unintended economic, security, and social justice consequences. The Net-Zero Producers Forum, with Canada as a founding member, is intended to provide a platform to advance a set of pragmatic and effective solutions to global climate challenges by fostering international cooperation among major hydrocarbon producers. The aim is to help achieve the necessary reduction in emissions in a sustainable manner. The objectives of the forum include support for development of net-zero strategies, promoting and implementing best practices, advancing carbon management technologies, and fostering cooperation on abatement of methane and fossil fuel combustion emissions. Transparent measurement and benchmarking tools will play an important role in carbon management and are critical to ensuing that technology and policy solutions are working as intended. © 2022 NPSIA.",About Sufficiency
Do climate change policies affect labour market distortions? Empirical evidence from China's low-carbon city pilots,"To mitigate climate change while ensuring that the substantial benefits of a green economic transition are widely shared, the concept of a just transition has emerged as a pivotal element in climate strategies. Although the effectiveness of climate policies has been a subject of ongoing debate, the integration of just transition principles is often overlooked as a key component. This study employs China’s Low-Carbon City Pilot policy (LCCP) as a quasi-natural experiment and uses a time-varying difference-in-differences (DID) methodology to assess the impact of LCCP on wage distortions within firms. Using data from listed companies between 2006 and 2022, our analysis shows that the low-carbon policy itself may be a source of inequity, disproportionately benefiting capital at the expense of labour, thus exacerbating wage distortions and preventing labour from receiving fair compensation. This inequity undermines the principles of a just transition, as the allocation of policy resources tends to favour large firms, enhancing their pricing power and diminishing labour market flexibility. The economic outcomes of LCCP are mixed: while it accelerates the growth of capital share, it also leads to an unequal distribution between capital and labour. Furthermore, our exploration of the role of export trade in mitigating these distortions reveals that exports actually widen the disparity in wage distortions. Our study underscores the urgent need to prioritize equity in climate policies and improve labour allocation efficiency within climate action frameworks. We aim to provide decision-making support for the design and implementation of more equitable low-carbon policies in developing countries. Key policy insights Empirical evidence suggests that LCCP has led to unfair compensation for workers. These findings aim to guide the design of more equitable low-carbon policies in developing countries. We recommend that while mitigating climate change, governments prioritize reforms in factor markets to maintain order and protect workers’ rights. Policy evaluation should account for regional and firm-specific impacts, balancing regulatory oversight of large firms with targeted support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Addressing wage distortions requires confronting the systemic biases in policy execution that favour large firms and marginalize smaller ones. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",About Sufficiency
Formation of competitive AIC in conditions of mining region sustainable development (on the example of Kuzbass),"This article considers the particular features of the development of the agro-industrial complex (AIC) in the conditions of mining regions. The Kuzbass (Kemerovo region) has been chosen as the object of analysis. A conceptual approach to the food security of the industrial region is presented, in the framework of which the main goals and objectives, principles and directions of development of the agricultural sector of industrial regions are shown. The article systematizes the results of previous studies of the authors related to the conditions and development factors of the AIC of the Kemerovo region. It has been established that the Kemerovo region as an industrial region is characterized by specific features of the AIC development which have evolved under the influence of climate, the available natural resources and the results of local economic activity. The current state of the Kuzbass agro-industry suggests that the region cannot ensure high competitiveness in the main types of agricultural products and their processed products. In the current economic conditions, introduction of deep processing of agricultural products on an innovative basis, production of functional products, integration and cooperation of producers, and improvement of production technologies may become the promising areas for the development of the agro-industrial complex of the Kemerovo region. The development of these areas will make it possible to produce agricultural products and food products with higher added value, and therefore, to increase the competitiveness of the agricultural sector in the region. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",About Sufficiency
On the relationship between policy uncertainty and sustainable investing,"Purpose: In recent times, sustainable investment gaining much attention within the investors’ community and it is broadly driven by environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. This study aims to examine the ESG-based sustainability index and economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Design/methodology/approach: Corporate sustainability assessment procedure yields Dow Jones sustainability indexes (DJSIUS) and ESG compliant firms become a member of such indexes. To uncover the effects of policy uncertainty as follows: the study considers EPU index, equity market policy uncertainty index, economic and political events for the period 2000–2017. The authors present the study using a conditional volatility framework. Findings: The correlation between the DJSIUS and policy uncertainty appears to be negative and statistically significant. It is apparent from the results that policy uncertainty does contain important ESG factors that explain the sustainable investment in US firms. Moreover, the stock market boom, credit crunch, Lehman collapse and fiscal crises have shown significant adverse effects on the sustainability index. More importantly, it is seen that investors’ sustainable investing considers presidential election years for portfolio planning; the uncertainty associated with the election years has also shown a negative impact on the sustainable returns. Practical implications: First, sustainability is essential for the long-term stakeholders’ wealth maximization under governments’ policy uncertainty such as constrained resources, demographic and climate-change-policy, societal expectations, public-policies, regulatory structure. Second, EPU creates new opportunities and risks for sustainable firms and sustainable investing. Originality/value: The study is novel in which the authors present the effects of uncertainty on socially responsible investing. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",About Sufficiency
Food security constraints and role of biosaline agriculture in meeting food demand in the gulf states,"The combination of limited fresh water supplies, poor soils and hyper-arid environment (dryland system), and climate change impact in Gulf States (GS) constrains the local economic agricultural production of many crops grown for food and fodder. The difference between the Ecological Footprint of Consumption and the Biocapacity of GS, suggests a net deficit between the eco-resources generated and those consumed and wasted. Given these existing and predicted challenges, it would be hard for the GS to achieve food security unless there are considerable technological innovations in agriculture and water research to boost local production. To meet food security, GS may be seeking options of acquiring land abroad for agriculture. Leasing prime land in poor developing countries is questioned by many actors, so the sensible option is to acquire marginal (saline) lands in these developing countries, over one billion ha available globally, or acquire prime land in countries where there are resources surpluses (abundant soil and water resources) concentrated in ecological creditors' countries, which currently do not utilize their full biocapacity and the production cost is lower. In the former case, ICBA can significantly support GS in growing salt-tolerant crops (Biosaline Agriculture) in the marginal land acquired abroad and by bringing them into crop production through an integrated approach of reclamation of salt-affected lands, thus, paving the way forward for food security. Over the last 13 years ICBA has developed a world-wide reputation for its expertise in the development of salt-tolerant germplasm and applied research and development in many of the 57 IDB-member countries including the GS. The groundwater in the GS is mostly saline or brackish and biosaline agriculture is the best approach. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. All rights are reserved.",About Sufficiency

Evaluating wheat response to biostimulants: a 25-year review of field-based research (2000–2024),"Wheat, a staple crop, faces numerous challenges due to climate change and the increasing demand for sustainable practices. Biostimulants, which enhance plant growth and resilience, have gained attention for their potential to improve wheat productivity in an environment-friendly manner. This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of field-based research on wheat's response to biostimulants under field conditions from 2000 to 2024. Analyzing 222 studies, the bibliometric analysis reveals a significant rise in research publications on biostimulants, with an annual growth rate of 15.6%. Asia leads with the largest share of publications (59.4%), followed by Europe (18.1%) and Africa (11.6%). North America, South America and Oceania have fewer contributions. Additionally, research institutions in Pakistan, India and Egypt rank as the most productive on this topic. Saudi Arabia stands out with the highest percentage of international collaboration, at 91.7% between countries and 100% among institutions. The findings reveal that biostimulants significantly improve wheat's ability to withstand abiotic stress, optimize nutrient uptake, and enhance overall plant health. Research is transitioning from traditional organic methods and microbial inoculants to advanced biostimulant formulations, improved nutrient management, and reduced environmental impact. However, gaps remain, particularly in understanding the combined effects of multiple biostimulants and their long-term impact on wheat and soil health. This synthesis of research trends lays the groundwork for advancing sustainable wheat production, supporting food security and agricultural resilience amidst environmental challenges.

Confronting the contradiction: Global capitalism and environmental health,"This paper examines the contradiction of economic globalization and environmental health. Despite the emergence of a significant environmental movement, the ecological health of many democratic industrial nation-states remains poor and the overall environmental health of the planet is declining rapidly (Brown 2000). The first section of this paper reviews literature that suggests that the inability of democratic industrial nation-states to reduce environmental degradation results from compromising environmental health in the interests of capital accumulation by regulating rather than eliminating environmentally destructive behaviors. The failure of democratic industrial nation-states to achieve environmental health is being exacerbated further by the creation of a globalized capitalist system managed by a variety of international free-trade agreements and the World Trade Organization. In the second section, we examine decisions made by these new managers of capital over the interests of environmental health. In the last section of this paper, we deconstruct the ideological tenets of global capitalism as they pertain to achieving environmental health and social justice.",About Sufficiency
Redesigning a closed loop food supply chain network considering sustainability and food banks with different returns,"Increasing the importance of sustainability in supply chain has motivated companies to redesign networks considering social and environmental responsibilities along with economic concerns. Food shortage, food waste and air pollution introduced as the main issues of global food and environmental problems. We propose a new mathematical model for redesigning food network in all aspects of sustainability. The objectives of the model are to minimize costs, transportation emissions, and unsatisfied foodbanks' demand. Foodbank as the main pillar of social responsibility has been introduced in food chain. In this paper, returned products divide into usable and recoverable products based on health security, in which usable products are not sellable but beneficial for those who do not care about appearance and can cover foodbank demand. Finally, computational study is made based on an Iranian food company data. The results reveal that more geographical diversity, using new distribution centers, and adding foodbanks helps to a sustainable network. © 2021, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

Plant genome engineering for targeted improvement of crop traits,"To improve food security, plant biology research aims to improve crop yield and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, as well as increasing the nutrient contents of food. Conventional breeding systems have allowed breeders to produce improved varieties of many crops; for example, hybrid grain crops show dramatic improvements in yield. However, many challenges remain and emerging technologies have the potential to address many of these challenges. For example, site-specific nucleases such as TALENs and CRISPR/Cas systems, which enable high-efficiency genome engineering across eukaryotic species, have revolutionized biological research and its applications in crop plants. These nucleases have been used in diverse plant species to generate a wide variety of site-specific genome modifications through strategies that include targeted mutagenesis and editing for various agricultural biotechnology applications. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas genome-wide screens make it possible to discover novel traits, expand the range of traits, and accelerate trait development in target crops that are key for food security. Here, we discuss the development and use of various site-specific nuclease systems for different plant genome-engineering applications. We highlight the existing opportunities to harness these technologies for targeted improvement of traits to enhance crop productivity and resilience to climate change. These cutting-edge genome-editing technologies are thus poised to reshape the future of agriculture and food security. © 2019 Sedeek, Mahas and Mahfouz.",About Sufficiency
Impacts of international food trade on natural resources,"The rapid expansion of global food trade over the last decades has intensified the debate about its environmental impacts and the role of trade policies in resource conservation. This paper examines whether trade restrictions can effectively address environmental pressures by analyzing the complex linkages between international trade and natural resource exploitation. Through a critical review of the existing evidence, the paper shows that while trade-induced specialization does not always lead to a more efficient and sustainable use of resources, trade restrictions alone often represent a second-best solution. Because they do not address the market failures that shape resource exploitation in the first place, such restrictions risk being not only ineffective but potentially counterproductive. Successful environmental protection requires integrated policy approaches that recognize the intricate relationships between trade liberalization, resource management, and food security. © The Author(s) 2025.",About Sufficiency
Mapping and linking supply- and demand-side measures in climate-smart agriculture. A review,"Climate change and food security are two of humanity’s greatest challenges and are highly interlinked. On the one hand, climate change puts pressure on food security. On the other hand, farming significantly contributes to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This calls for climate-smart agriculture—agriculture that helps to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Climate-smart agriculture measures are diverse and include emission reductions, sink enhancements, and fossil fuel offsets for mitigation. Adaptation measures include technological advancements, adaptive farming practices, and financial management. Here, we review the potentials and trade-offs of climate-smart agricultural measures by producers and consumers. Our two main findings are as follows: (1) The benefits of measures are often site-dependent and differ according to agricultural practices (e.g., fertilizer use), environmental conditions (e.g., carbon sequestration potential), or the production and consumption of specific products (e.g., rice and meat). (2) Climate-smart agricultural measures on the supply side are likely to be insufficient or ineffective if not accompanied by changes in consumer behavior, as climate-smart agriculture will affect the supply of agricultural commodities and require changes on the demand side in response. Such linkages between demand and supply require simultaneous policy and market incentives. It, therefore, requires interdisciplinary cooperation to meet the twin challenge of climate change and food security. The link to consumer behavior is often neglected in research but regarded as an essential component of climate-smart agriculture. We argue for not solely focusing research and implementation on one-sided measures but designing good, site-specific combinations of both demand- and supply-side measures to use the potential of agriculture more effectively to mitigate and adapt to climate change. © 2017, The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
The Political Economy of Water,"The political economy of Pakistan’s water is a complex interplay of interests that in the modern era, beginning in the nineteenth century, emerged from within the context of colonialism. The foundation of the irrigated economy that was laid during British rule privileged particular norms of water control that, to large extents, persist and shape current policies. Given the rising and changing demands on the uses of water that have naturally arisen through the passage of time, coupled with a rapidly changing climate, prevailing water policy and allocation are hard-pressed to meet evolving societal, environmental, and economic goals. Particular and longstanding challenges arise from the political economy of interprovincial water-sharing and are further compounded by the changing geopolitics of transnational infrastructure finance within the prevailing narrative that privileges increasing supply over reducing or managing demand. Within and across sectors, a host of challenges arise from the failure to value water for its proper and integrated environmental, social, economic, and political uses. Meanwhile, the growing role of the private sector, in areas such as commercial groundwater extraction for drinking water as well as in beverage and industrial production more broadly that significantly impair water quality and the environment, remains a largely under-governed space. Since the British era, agriculture remains the foundation of the economy and with rising demands from a growing population, food and commodity security for both crops and dairy and livestock production within the context of global food production and trade flows have become ever more complex. These forces are playing out within the context of global climate change and evolving norms of water storage that take into account methane emissions from large dams as part of international climate pledges, further compounding Pakistan’s overall water, food and energy security goals. An improved understanding of local contexts as they interact with global trends will need to be developed to improve Pakistan’s political economy of water. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",About Sufficiency
"Environmental sustainability assessment using dynamic Autoregressive-Distributed Lag simulations—Nexus between greenhouse gas emissions, biomass energy, food and economic growth","Increasing population demand has triggered the enhancement of food production, energy consumption and economic development, however, its impact on climate change has become a global concern. This study applied a novel environmental sustainability assessment tool using dynamic Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) simulations for model estimation of the relationships between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, biomass, food and economic growth for Australia using data spanning from 1970 to 2017. The study found an inversed-U shaped relationship between energy consumption and income level, showing a decarbonized and services economy, hence, improved energy efficiency. While energy consumption increases emissions by 0.4 to 2.8%, biomass consumption supports Australia's transition to a decarbonized economy by reducing GHG emissions by 0.13% and shifts the demand for fossil fuel. Food and energy consumption underpin socio-economic development and vice versa. However, food waste from production and consumption increases ecological footprint, implying a lost opportunity to improve food security and reduce environmental pressure from agricultural production. There is no single path to achieving environmental sustainability, nonetheless, the integrated approach applied in this study reveals conceptual tools which are applicable for decision making. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Attaining sustainable development via green economy catalysts in post-Covid-19 Africa: An analytical examination,"The convergence of global crises sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental degradation, and supply disruptions due to regional conflicts in Europe and the Middle East has underscored the imperative for analyzing the drivers of green growth in emerging economies. While considerable research has focused on green growth in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) nations, there still is a significant gap in understanding Africa’s transition to a green economy. Fundamental questions about the key variables propelling Africa’s green growth, their interconnectedness, potential obstacles to green economy development, and the trajectory of future research in this area remain largely unaddressed in the extant literature. This review paper aims to evaluate the state of Africa’s green economy by synthesizing recent scientific literature on green growth in WEIRD nations from an African perspective. Employing an analytical approach grounded in holistic frameworks and systems thinking, the study conducts a thorough multidisciplinary assessment of existing research. Using the PRISMA systematic review approach, the search terms, databases, inclusion and exclusion criteria were designated for the study.In addition to exploring the challenges of green industrialization, the research investigates the driving forces and essential elements necessary for achieving Africa’s progress towards achieving net zero emissions. Common hurdles such as susceptibility to extreme climate events, natural disasters, and ecological degradation are found, alongside the potential benefits of attaining net zero emissions, including equitable distribution of climate benefits, reduction of adverse health impacts, and addressing social inequalities, particularly among low-income and vulnerable populations and communities. The contributions of this paper are as follows: firstly, it broadens knowledge about the possible forces propelling the green sector and how policy makers in Africa may be guided to design strategies for achieving net-zero economy in their particular context. secondly, Important gaps are found, common themes are recognized and addressed, and notable scholars and their own conceptual and theoretical contributions are all highlighted by this analytical examination. It is hoped that this paper will offer a theoretical and empirical foundation to inspire future researchers to take on the significant research tasks related to how environmental policy imperatives and domestic green growth interact with the global climate. © 2024 The Author(s).

"The triangle: Energy, water & food nexus for sustainable security in the arab middle east","This chapter examines water security in the broader relationships governing the Food-Water-Energy-Climate Nexus. It particularly stresses the role of the great global transmissions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in presenting intractable barriers to returning to less complicated eras of resource conflicts. These transitions are manifest in total and urban populations’ growth and shift to urbanization; radical shifts in the nutrition demanded by the new economic and social developments; the radical changes in land use and chemicals in agriculture; a rapid shift in emphasis on renewable energy resources and reduced reliance on fossil fuels; and finally the great challenge of climate change. All of these transitions have major implications for water security both globally, and regionally. Globally this is well articulated by DuBois (The case for “energy-smart food for people and climate”. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Food Day-Oct 16, 2015): Our agrifood systems currently consume 30 percent of the world’s available energy-with more than 70 percent occurring beyond the farm gate, and produce about 20 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. More than one third of the food we produce is lost or wasted, and with it about 38 percent of the energy consumed in the agrifood chain. To this we can add that the greatest loss of water in the overall national water balances is that of the water used to grow the food that is wasted. While the water security situation for the Arab Middle East Region is generally considered bleak, the paper is fairly optimistic that, at least water resource use, until 2050 will be still manageable if the eleven “technical fixes,"" outlined in the paper are pursued. These technical fixes are not to be construed as purely engineering the water supply, but fixes to many of the economic and social barriers to a more secure water future. They cover major national policy choices such as international trade in virtual water, traditional water engineering of traditional and non-traditional sources, improving efficiency in use via agronomic research, improvement of post harvest food and value chains, and softer optionssuch as trading among users, pricing, rationalizing property rights and legal protection for third parties. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",About Sufficiency
Grassland and managed grazing policy review,"Perennial grasslands, including prairie and pasture, have declined with tremendous environmental and social costs. This decline reflects unequal policy support for grasslands and managed grazing compared to row crops. To create a resource for community partners and decision-makers, we reviewed and analyzed the policy tools and implementation capacity that supports and constrains grasslands and managed grazing in the U.S. Upper Midwest. Risk reduction subsidies for corn and soybeans far outpace the support for pasture. Some states lost their statewide grazing specialist when the federal Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative lapsed. The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service support for lands with prescribed grazing practices declined after 2005 but remained relatively steady 2010–2020. These results reveal the policy disadvantage for grasslands and managed grazing in comparison with row crop agriculture for milk and meat production. Grassland and grazing policies have an important nexus with water quality, biodiversity, carbon and outdoor recreation policy. Socially just transitions to well-managed, grazed grasslands require equity-oriented interventions that support community needs. We synthesized recommendations for national and state policy that farmers and other grazing professionals assert would support perennial grasslands and grazing, including changes in insurance, conservation programs, supply chains, land access, and fair labor. These policies would provide critical support for grass-based agriculture and prairies that we hope will help build soil, retain nutrients, reduce flooding and enhance biodiversity while providing healthy food, jobs, and communities.

Globalization - What's in it for the poor in terms of water and food security?,"In recent years, a greater level of integration of the world economy and an opening of national markets to trade has impacted virtually all areas of society. At the same time, water scarcity and the phenomena of a 'global water crisis' have become part of our vocabulary. With most of the water worldwide being used for irrigated agriculture, and an increasing share of irrigated production being traded, trade policy has become intrinsically linked with both water and food security. While the process of globalization has the potential to generate long-term benefits for developing-countries, the distribution of those benefits is lessclear. Whereas countries with competitive (agricultural) production sectors and strong export potential have called for more open markets, those less competitive and fearful of adverse consequences on their farmers have been reluctant to increased liberalization efforts. Moreover, while the implications from changes in trade policy on national food production levels are often analyzed - albeit result of studies sometimes differ - impacts on water supply and demand, and water security are seldom studied and usually not known. This paper will analyze various alternative trade scenarios and their impact on food supply, demand, and water and food security using the recently enhanced IMPACT-WATER modeling framework.

"Ramie, a multipurpose crop: potential applications, constraints and improvement strategies","World population growth has increased the demand for food and shelter, thus threatening environmental sustainability and expanding the gap between resource availability and the ability to meet human needs. Humans are fulfilling their needs by depleting natural resources. Currently, exploring plant species that can fulfill the life requirements of both humans and animals without degrading natural resources has become a major challenge. Therefore, research on underutilized crops is of high interest among plant scientists. Ramie, an ancient plant with a long history, is being researched because of its vigorous growth, high nutritional value and multipurpose applications in Textiles, livestock feed, environmental conservation and medicine. It can be cultivated in versatile conditions including tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. The present review article provides a detailed discussion on the multipurpose utilization and nutritional importance of ramie as well as potential applications and constraints, and the outlook for the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
An ecological economics perspective on sustainability and prospects for ending poverty,"Despite our pretensions to science, modern industrial society is as myth-bound and mystical as any that has preceded it. Our prevailing cultural myth includes a dangerous vision of global sustainability and poverty reduction centered on unlimited economic expansion, ""free"" trade and technological fixes. This paper dissects the modern myth, exposing its conceptual flaws and practical failings. It then proposes an alternative conceptual framework for development derived from ecological economics and ecological footprint analysis. The new framework recognizes that the human enterprise is a subsystem of the ecosphere whose growth is constrained by biophysical limits. If humanity is to seize control of its destiny it must arise above wishful thinking and tribal instinct. Global society needs a new cultural myth rooted in humanity's unique claim to intelligence and self-awareness in the face of danger. Human security depends on equitable development-not growth-within the means of nature. Sustainability with social justice can be achieved only through an unprecedented level of international cooperation rooted in a sense of compassion for both other peoples and other species.",About Sufficiency
Climate change and its impacts on community food and livelihood in kumaun himalaya: A case study of dabka catchment,"Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change-IPCC (2001, 2007a, 2007b) warns that the progress in human develop ment achieved over the last decade may be slowed down or even reversed by climate change, as new threats emerge to food and livelihood security, agri cultural production and access, and nutrition and public health. Agriculture constitutes the backbone of most developing economies throughout the world and in turn, food and fi ber production is essential for sustaining and enhancing human welfare (Rosenzweig and Parry 1994, Fischer et al. 1996). Consequently, agriculture has been a major concern in discussions on climate change. Agronomic and economic impacts from climate change depend primarily on two factors, i.e., (i) the rate and magnitude of change in climate attributes and the agricultural effects of these changes, and (ii) the ability of agricultural production to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Temperature, precipitation, atmospheric carbon dioxide content, the incidence of extreme events and sea level rise are the main climate change-related drivers which impact agricultural production (Adams 1998). Climate change, however, is considered as posing the greatest threat to agriculture and food security in the 21st century, particularly in many of the poor, agriculture-based countries with their low capacity to cope effectively (Darwin and Kennedy 2000, Adams et al. 1995). Mountain agriculture is already under stress as a result of population increase, industrialization and urbanization, competition over resource use, degradation of resources and insuffi cient public spending for rural infrastructure and services. The impact of climate change is likely to exacerbate these stresses even further. The outlook for the coming decades is that agricul tural productivity needs to continue to increase and will require more water to meet the demands of grow ing populations. Ensuring equitable access to water and its benefi ts now and for future generations is a major challenge as scarcity and competition increase. The amount of water allocated to agriculture and water management choices will determine, to a large extent, whether societies achieve economic and social development and environmental sustainability (Iglesias et al. 2000, Easterling et al. 1993). © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",About Sufficiency
Navigating the Challenges of a Warmer Climate: Strategies for Mitigating Impacts and Fostering Resilience in India,"The rising temperatures impact the environment, economy, public health, and global climate. This rise can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions, urbanization, deforestation, and changes in oceanic currents. Higher temperatures pose a health risk and can result in dehydration and heat stroke while also affecting agricultural yields, aggravating water scarcity, increase in the frequency and intensity of hydroclimatic extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding, or droughts in different regions. Further, it can affect the construction, energy generation, and tourism industries. This paper highlights the fundamental factors behind the summer temperature rise in India and its impacts. The recommendations aim to improve the adaptation to the changes on individual and governmental levels. There is a need to encourage a carbon-neutral economy and tap into the resources for research and development of technologies. The paper also underscores the relationship between increased temperatures and the possibility of a pandemic in the future, as increased temperatures have the ability to change the pathogen behavior, and understanding the relationship between both is essential to formulate policies and future interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.",About Sufficiency
New futures for older ports: Synergistic development in a global urban system,"Port cities are on the front-line of a changing global urban system. There are problems from restructuring of trade, logistics and ship-building, creating economic dependency, social exclusion and cultural destruction. Meanwhile, there exists new opportunities in heritage tourism, cultural industries and ecological restoration, but these opportunities often have negative impacts. This paper addresses the question of how port cities can steer from negative to positive development paths and outcomes. It sets out a way of working with inter-connected economic, social, political and technological factors-a =synergistic' approach to mapping of problems and design of policy responses. Looking at three contrasting examples of port cities-Liverpool, Dubai and Mauritius-we can compare the inter-connected dynamics of growth and decline. Then we can understand the inter-connected factors of successful regeneration and sustainable prosperity, not as linear =policy fixes', but more like synergistic processes of learning, innovation and capacity building. These call for new models for creative innovation in social and community enterprise: cultural heritage both old and new; new social finance and investment; socio-ecological restoration with participative governance, etc. Such pathways and opportunities are now emerging in many different locations; this paper provides methods and tools to understand them and promote them. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",About Sufficiency
Do world uncertainty and income inequality moderate the efficacy of environmental innovation in driving global renewable energy generation?,"Environmental innovation is pivotal in tackling climate change by offering diverse and practical solutions to reduce carbon footprints, promote resource conservation, and enhance ecological sustainability. As anthropogenic activities continue to accelerate global environmental degradation, innovative solutions are imperative for mitigating the impacts of climate change and fostering sustainability. However, the effectiveness of these innovations is threatened by global uncertainties and rising income inequalities. Uncertainties in geopolitical landscape and economic disparities may impede the development and widespread adoption of eco-friendly technologies and practices. Given the above background, this study empirically investigates the influences of environmental innovation, world uncertainty and income inequality on renewable energy generation for a balanced panel of 58 countries between 1990 and 2020. The estimated models also control for the effects of globalisation and economic growth. After diagnosing for necessary panel diagnostic tests including cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneity, and panel unit-root, the Westerlund cointegration test confirms a significant long-run relationship between the variables of the study. Using panel Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimation, the results reveal that while environmental innovation continues to promote the renewable energy generation, global uncertainty and income inequality hamper it. More importantly, the moderating effects of world uncertainty and income inequality reduce the favourable impact of environmental innovation on renewable energy generation. Besides, economic growth and globalisation continue to play critical roles in speeding up the quest for renewable energy. The PCSE estimation technique confirms the significance of these baseline findings. Potential policy implications are also discussed. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",About Sufficiency
Ag-IoT: Empowering Sustainable and Economic Organic Agriculture,"In India, where agriculture plays a major part in the economy, the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) has completely transformed crop management. By giving farmers real-time data on weather, soil quality, and environmental factors, they can now make more informed decisions, leading to reduced losses due to disease and increased productivity. The use of IoT technology extends beyond field monitoring to include underground soil sensing, machinery management, and sensor-based irrigation systems, creating a comprehensive support network. This network connects farmers, experts, and advisors, promoting sustainable and profitable farming techniques. With challenges like climate change and resource limitations becoming more prevalent, modern agriculture increasingly relies on technology to boost efficiency and output. The explores the role of various platforms, sensor networks, satellite imagery, cloud computing, and big data analysis in digital agriculture. These technologies facilitate data exchange and communication between devices, streamlining operations.

Revitalizing plastic wastes employing bio-circular-green economy principles for carbon neutrality,"The use of plastics has become deeply ingrained in our society, and there are no indications that its prevalence will decrease in the foreseeable future. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the global plastic waste disposal landscape, examining it through regional perspectives, various management technologies (dumping or landfilling, incineration, and reuse and recycling), and across different sectors including agriculture and food, textile, tourism, and healthcare. Notably, this study compiles the findings on life-cycle carbon footprints associated with various plastic waste management practices as documented in the literature. Employing the bio-circular-green economy model, we advocate for the adoption of streamlined and sustainable approaches to plastic management. Unique management measures are also discussed including the utilization of bioplastics combined with smart and efficient collection processes that facilitate recycling, industrial composting, or anaerobic digestion. Moreover, the integration of advanced recycling methods for conventional plastics with renewable energy, the establishment of plastic tax and credits, and the establishment of extended producer responsibility are reviewed. The success of these initiatives relies on collaboration and support from peers, industries, and consumers, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and fostering sustainable practices in plastic waste management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Integrated Agro-waste Valorization and Biorefinery Approach: Prospects and Challenges,"Agricultural commodities including fresh and processed foods are highly perishable in nature and resulting in the generation of significant agro-waste during harvesting, processing, and post-consumption. In recent years, agro-waste has received growing interest from the domestic and global perspectives, due to the growing concerns about food security and environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions attributed to intensified effects of global warming. Agricultural wastes are considered as hidden treasury for various bioactive compounds (e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), and potential sources of high-value products such as biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel, organic acids, enzymes, phenolic, and flavoring compounds. A novel approach for addressing the agro-waste is biorefinery which emerged as a sustainable way of valorization. Bio-refining food waste might help achieve sustainable zero-waste growth. Agro-waste biorefinery techniques urgently need a circular economy and contribute to a low-carbon, cleaner environment that is ecologically beneficial, economically, and technically feasible, and widely accepted. This chapter will comprehensively explain agro-waste with their sources, agricultural waste valorization status, and possible novel and green technology in an integrated biorefinery approach to recovery of the bioactive compounds and their application in the agro-processing sector. In addition, prospective research for managing waste and valorization approaches will be explored, along with their technical bottleneck and limitations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",About Sufficiency
"Life cycle thinking of plasma gasification as a waste-to-energy tool: Review on environmental, economic and social aspects","Following the actual pace of industrial development, due to the ever-growing tech- and resource-savvy society, unprecedented waste amounts are generated on a daily basis. Therefore, “waste-to-energy” (WtE) techniques appear as a possible approach to convert solid residues into energy, within more energy-efficient processes to emit less or no CO2. Plasma gasification constitutes a proficient and clean alternative with multiple environmental gains, simultaneously reducing or eliminating toxicity and pollution issues while avoiding the landfilling of huge amounts of residues. To evaluate the performance of this WtE treatment, the life cycle thinking (LCT) methodology gathers useful impact assessment tools, providing quantifiable indicators on multiple domains. The lack of works reporting the combined assessment of the environmental, technical, economic and social spheres of WtE has been previously noticed and, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no such review so far for plasma gasification. This work proposes a deep review of literature on the life cycle assessment, life cycle costing and social impact assessment of plasma gasification, to evaluate how LCT tools are applied to the energetic valorization of solid residues by this technique, as a measure of sustainability. This provides insights on the contribution of energy recovery as a circular strategy, diverting waste from open dumps or landfills, while producing renewable energy and/or by-products that will replace the use of virgin materials. Herein, an attempt to complement the knowledge in the sectors of renewable energies and waste management is conducted, to support the fulfillment of circular economy goals and contribute to a more sustainable society and way of living. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Cooperatives and Social Innovation: Experiences from the Asia Pacific Region,"This book discusses social innovations by cooperatives from the Asia and Pacific region. Social innovations emerge when the state and market in developing countries find it difficult to solve problems such as poverty, hunger, ill health, poor education systems, inadequate drinking water and poor sanitation. These countries also face barriers to economic growth such as climate change, poor governance, unequal opportunities and social exclusion. This volume therefore addresses the following questions. What are the distinctive features of social innovations by cooperatives? How social innovations bring in changes in the process and outcome of development? After presenting theories of social innovation and a critical review of cooperatives and social innovation, the book presents 15 chapters on social innovations by cooperatives in the Asia Pacific region. These social innovations are related to health insurance, community based tourism, disaster response, climate smart agriculture, use of social media for youth empowerment, training for the emergence of second-line leaders in cooperatives, social inclusion through innovative finance, profitable marketing of organic produce to strengthen economic status of small farmers, digital auction and value addition for income security of farmer members, collaboration between cooperative members and workers for the mutual benefit, worker cooperatives, women leadership and participation, building union-cooperative partnership in finance and rating of cooperatives to promote transparency and accountability. A chapter on innovative services of cooperatives during the time of Covid19 is also included. This volume will be quite significant for co-operators, researchers, teachers, practitioners and policy-makers at the global level. The theme is relevant for international development community and national cooperatives with concern for their communities, which is the seventh cooperative principle of International Cooperative Alliance and the Sustainable Development Goal of the UN. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",About Sufficiency
"The role of entrepreneurship as catalysts for sustainability and a green, resilient economy: Critical discourse analysis","Entrepreneurship, sustainability, and the creation of a resilient, green economy are intricately linked, particularly as conventional economic models grapple with existential challenges. However, empirical research addressing the connection between entrepreneurship and sustainability for a more balanced and resilient future is notably scarce. This chapter aims to bridge this gap by investigating the role of entrepreneurship in advancing sustainability and establishing a resilient, green economy. Through comprehensive research utilizing critical discourse analysis (CDA), three research questions were explored to draw insightful managerial and practical implications. In the intersection of entrepreneurship, sustainability, and a green, resilient economy, opportunities are seized by entrepreneurship amid limitations, while sustainability presupposes responsible management of resources for current needs without compromising the future. A green economy ensures adaptability, growth, and ecological stability even in resource-scarce conditions. The CDA affirms the influential role of entrepreneurship in pursuing sustainability and a green, resilient economy, drawing from 18 cases across public, private, and social sectors to highlight environmental, social, and economic impacts. Furthermore, the CDA uncovers power dynamics, ideologies, and social structures affecting entrepreneurship's role in fostering sustainable and resilient, green economies. Collaborations between governments, corporations, and social ventures in diverse countries promote sustainability within existing social structures, fostering comprehensive development. However, imbalanced power dynamics pose challenges, risking potential social exclusion. This chapter concludes by addressing practical implications and limitations, aiming to contribute to an ecologically balanced and socially equitable future by understanding entrepreneurship's role in promoting sustainability and green resilience within the context of power dynamics, ideologies, and social structures. © 2024 by Lukman Raimi.

"ICT’s Impact on Food Security in South Asian Countries: The Role of Economic Growth, Energy Consumption, and Environmental Quality","South Asia faces a tremendous challenge in ensuring food security for its growing population. Poverty, climate change, and resource limitations threaten food production and access. Information and communication technology (ICT) provides a variety of techniques to increase food security. This research examines ICT’s effect on food security by regulating CO2 emissions, energy use, and economic growth in South Asian (SA) nations. It takes panel data from 1997 to 2021 and applies the 2nd generation unit root and Westerlund cointegration tests. For this reason, it is necessary to use 2nd generation Westerlund cointegration tests and the “Dumitrescu-Hurlin (D-H) causality test” to ensure the validity of the “Second-generation estimation technique(s) the Driscoll and Kraay method.” The outcomes of the bootstrap cointegration test support the existence of long-run cointegration. The Driscoll and Kraay results show a symmetric relationship between ICT and food security, linked to higher CO2 emissions, whereas economic growth and renewable energy consumption increase the latter. As a result of the significant positive stimulus it has on food security, developing ICT is vital to raising food security in South Asian countries. The results from the Driscoll and Kraay estimates are consistent with those from the GLS, proving the Driscoll and Kraay results are reliable. The D-H causality also confirms the GLS and Driscoll and Kraay results. To enhance environmental quality and food security, governments can fund green ICT R&D. Policymakers consider financial incentives such as tax breaks, grants, and subsidies to incentivize ICT companies to adopt sustainable practices and technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",About Sufficiency
Analysis of European environmental policies: Improving decision making through eco-efficiency,"There is extensive literature that defines eco-efficiency as the efficiency with which ecological resources are used to satisfy human needs. It ensures production while consuming fewer natural resources and thus reduces the environmental impact. The aim of this work is to fill the gap in the literature by defining eco-efficiency in terms of production and deaths due to pollution. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist Index (MI) are used for this purpose. Both techniques are applied to 20 European countries during the period 2014–2018. In addition, the spatial dependence of eco-efficiency obtained in the DEA analysis is studied using geostatistical techniques. The results reveal the good performance of almost all European countries, which are conditioned neither by their wealth nor by their economic growth. Eastern European countries show the most room for improvement. Finally, the spatial dependence of eco-efficiency in Europe during the period 2014–2018 was confirmed by detecting a significant cluster of low eco-efficiency countries in Eastern Europe. Researchers and policymakers can benefit from the results to provide country-specific investment policies to achieve higher benefits towards eco-efficiency in Europe. © 2022",About Sufficiency

"Digitization and globalization: navigating the impact on social capital, natural resources, and environmental sustainability","The impact of digitization in the context of globalization on the formation and preservation of social capital, natural resources, and the environment has been considered. In examining state strategies towards digitization and its influence on social capital, principles such as specificity, integrity, historicism, and rationality were employed, along with methods of comparison and constructive criticism, as well as categories of essence, necessity, and measure. Historical, anthropological, ontological, political, axiological, and dialectical methods played a significant role in reflecting the characteristics of the information age, defining strategies, and priorities for the development of states and social capital. Countries that vigorously integrate digitization into human existence tend to develop faster, reap economic benefits, thereby contributing to the preservation of social capital. Additionally, the processes of digitization become essential for creating a digital space for the formation of digital social capital and the digital individual, each possessing unique characteristics. The digitization of social capital processes entails the introduction of digital technologies into the ontological environment of individuals, where they become part of human reality. Both positive and negative aspects of digitization have been identified, with the impact of digitization on social capital formation being complex and multifaceted, depending on the state’s development strategy in this direction. Digital technologies facilitate communication, increase access to information and resources, promoting the development of social connections and cooperation, ultimately enabling quick responses to environmental challenges for the preservation of the environment. Digitization is one of the characteristics of a society of sustainable development. Within the concept of this society, it allows accumulating social capital, developing the economy, taking into account environmental requirements. From a practical point of view, digitalization is a condition for structural changes in organizations, as a result of which the processes of internal and external communication and management change. The development of a digitalized society, in which the accumulation of social capital takes place, has a positive effect on the implementation of the principles of sustainable development: the combination of nature conservation and social development; satisfaction of basic human needs; achieving equality and social justice; ensuring social self-determination and cultural diversity; maintaining the integrity of ecosystems. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",About Sufficiency

Mainstreaming ecosystem services through reformed European agricultural policies,"Agroecosystems are vital for supplying ecosystem services to human society, but most modern farming practices impact detrimentally on the environment. Public agricultural support policies have been critically important in influencing the transformation of the farm sectors; however, few of them have been dedicated to enhancing ecosystem services beyond agricultural commodities. The largest agricultural support system worldwide, the European common agricultural policy (CAP), has now come to a critical point, as major decisions concerning its design and implementation after 2013 are about to be taken. The debate on this reform process presents a unique opportunity to trigger a transition from commodity-based subsidy policies to policies centered on efficient provision of ecosystem services from agricultural land. To prompt such discussion, we formulate key recommendations informed by a review of ecosystem services literature and address verifiable links to human well-being, nonmarket valuation for balanced services provision, treatment of ecosystem services bundles, site-specific and regionalized approaches, matching spatial scales for different ecosystem services, funding permanence for payment schemes, strong monitoring and adaptive approaches to tackling uncertainties, and coherent cross-sectoral policy design. If these issues were to be considered in formulating and implementing future CAP, it might become an exemplar for redirecting agricultural policies elsewhere in the world toward sustainability. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",About Sufficiency
EU−Africa: Digital and Social Questions in a Multicultural Agroecological Transition for the Cocoa Production in Africa,"The challenge of this century is without a doubt to counter global warming. Land management, agriculture, and forests are responsible for 23% of total greenhouse gases (GHGs). In developing countries, such as those in African territories, where economic capacities are sometimes small and socio-cultural and linguistic perceptions are different, this requires a transition that is just and respectful of local culture and language, while at the same time helping to create labor conditions that respect gender and minors. This article describes a socio-technical ecological transition in the cocoa chain production in Côte d’Ivoire, which is not only the world’s leading producer of cocoa beans (45%) but also one of the African countries most prone to deforestation. Linguistic and multicultural aspects come together in Côte d’Ivoire, where more than 70 local languages are spoken. Intelligent digital approaches, agroecological issues, new methods, and sociocultural questions are embedded in a context of collaboration and co-creation, a living lab approach, to ensures sharing and co-creation among NGOs, farmers, companies, and researchers.

Evolution of the economic system: From a fossil-based economy to the circular bioeconomy,"Chapter 1 introduces the phenomenon of the bioeconomy, primarily through the economic and social context. The introductory theme is embedded in the history of economic thought, where concerns about the exploitation of resources and capital have existed since the beginnings of the science. For centuries, however, they have remained on the periphery of economics. The facts regarding the overshoot of planetary boundaries and unmet social needs in the current economic paradigm prove the need to change the approach to production and consumption. The circular bioeconomy is part of the answer to the above problems. Its importance stems from the assumptions of sustainable development. The second part of the chapter discusses the sources and concept of the bioeconomy and defines the context in which the bioeconomy is understood in this book. The final parts of the chapter deal with the economic and social conditions of the functioning of the bioeconomy, including the potential global risks associated with its unsustainable development in a global sense and its situation in the European Union. The potential of the bioeconomy and the emerging differences between countries are presented.

A research framework to investigate food systems at a national scale,"This article aims to advance understandings of food systems functioning at a national level and explore ways for its transformation towards sustainability and social justice. Integrating food regime theory from political economy with social metabolism from ecological economics, and surplus/reproduction from feminist economics, we develop a novel research framework which combines six dimensions—food systems governance, monetary agrifood chain, socio-metabolic agrifood chain, surplus/reproduction, socioecological impacts, and conflicts & levers of change—encompassing 34 elements linked through six key connections. The research framework highlights the role of cheap food for the social reproduction of the labouring population in capitalism. Since national states play important roles in maintaining food regimes, we conducted a critical literature review through which we identified the main contributions and limitations of studies of food regimes at the national level aimed at foreseeing exit ways beyond the current corporate food regime. This regime is one of the main drives of the overcoming of planetary boundaries. An agroecological transition and food system change is needed to address this socio-ecological crisis, and this requires new food polices at a national level as well. This is why we consider it essential to integrate social metabolism with the approaches of food regimes and surplus/reproduction. © 2024",About Sufficiency
Provisioning ecosystem services supply and demand: The role of landscape management to reinforce supply and promote synergies with other ecosystem services,"Currently, trade enables regions to have a higher provisioning ecosystem services (ES) demand than that provided by ecosystems in the same region. This practice leads to a supply and demand provisioning ES scale mismatch, which may affect the provision of other ES. To address such an issue from the sub-national scale, an ES approach implementation step to provide realistic, context-specific pathways toward sustainability is necessary. This paper provides a detailed quantitative assessment of ecosystem services over time in Biscay, Basque Country, Spain. The aim is to identify ways of balancing the local provisioning ecosystem service supply and demand and to enhance sustainable land use. We studied the ecological footprint evolution of the province for 11 years and its relation to ecosystem services. We determined that the replacement of the current forest plantations' monocultures to a multifunctional landscape reinforces food security and enhances biodiversity and essential ES. This place-based ecosystem services assessment, which integrates ecological footprint calculations into an ecosystem service framework, demonstrated that provisioning ES-scale mismatches may be confronted locally by implementing sustainable landscape management strategies, including actions focusing on the supply and demand of ES. The current globalised economy promotes a global reduction in ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services. Reducing the ecological footprint at the local scale would contribute to the reduction of provisioning ecosystem services' demand at the global scale. Thus, maximising a mosaic approach to land use locally would help improve the provision of ecosystem services and therefore also contribute to the global footprint reduction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",About Sufficiency
"The new challenges of processing tomatoes: Life cycle assessment, a relevant approach from the field to end use","Horticultural products, like all food products, are currently faced with three challenges concerning sustainable development. The first is to protect the environment The second challenge regards nutrition and health. Variety, transport conditions (temperature and duration), the type of technology used in processing (cold break, hot break) and the conditions of use of the final product are highly responsible for nutrient loss. The third challenge is the economic and social impact. Every segment of the food chains must guarantee an improvement in human wellbeing and social justice. Furthermore, consumers have changed and have replaced the traditional price-quality criteria used in making choices. They require information on environmental, nutritional and social aspects of the whole production and distribution systems Like all other products, industrial tomatoes must mirror these new market requirements and customer demands. Professionals are unable to cope with all three challenges simultaneously. With this in mind, an on-going national research programme in France (FLONUDEP) is aiming to create a decision-making tool adapted to this new context for the impact of both fresh and processed tomato production chains. A life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology has been applied to all stages of the product's life cycle, from the extraction of raw ingredient to the production system, processing, commercialisation, consumption and end of life, taking into account environmental, nutritional, economic and social considerations. Three countries have been studied: France, Turkey and Morocco. Results show considerable differences among the 3 countries, not only in terms of values, but also in terms of the most polluting stage across the LCA (whether agriculture, logistics, factory etc.). However, in general, the production methods, the organization of logistics circuits, and the choice of packaging seem to be crucial to environmental impact. In nutritional terms, product processing times are essential as is the ambient temperature which can alter nutrients. Logistics are therefore fundamental.

Carbon and material footprints of a welfare state: Why and how governments should enhance green investments,"Sustainable development and climate change mitigation have become guiding policy principles in many welfare states. However, the traditional role of a welfare state is to guarantee the economic stability, jobs and welfare for its citizens. Sustainable development leans on the idea that we can have economic, social and environmental sustainability at the same time. This would require decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. Decoupling should be studied globally, because within nations, the economy can grow while local environmental impacts decrease, but at the same time, global environmental impacts may increase due to international trade. In this study, we examine the consumption-based carbon and material footprints of a Nordic welfare state, Finland. We focus on the environmental impacts of public spending, which has received little attention previously. In welfare states, the reallocation of public funds to services and individuals are at its core. In the study, we examine how this affects the carbon and material footprints of various income groups and household types. We find that the share of public services and investments is 19% of the carbon footprint and 38% of the material footprint per capita. Building of infrastructure plays a major role in composing the material footprint. We also find that the welfare state has important features that improve the carbon equity between the citizens. To achieve absolute decoupling, required to reduce environmental impacts caused by economic activities, we suggest policies promoting public and private green investments. In addition, increased carbon pricing would enhance green investments and drive environmental innovation. © 2018 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Advances in wheat genetic enhancement for global food production,"Wheat provides about 19% of the food calories and 21% of the protein to the world population. In 2008, the total wheat area grownwas about 224 million ha and with a harvest of 690 million t of grain.The Green Revolution in wheat production, spawned by the development of short-stature, photoperiod-insensitive, high yielding wheat cultivars with host plant resistance to rusts and other pathogens, was able to increase wheat productivity at a 3.6% annual rate in the 1960s and 1970s. However, yield growth in wheat slip to 2.8% from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, and to 1.1% since the mid-1990s. In the period leading up to 2020, demand for wheat for human consumption in developing countries is expected to grow at 1.6 % per annum, and for feed at 2.6 % per annum. The global average of wheat yield will have therefore to increase in the coming years at least to 3.5 t ha-1. This yield increase, essential to maintain global food security, requires a continuing supply of improved germplasm and appropriate agronomy in order to sustain enhanced productivity and preserve the natural resource base of the wheat farming. Global warming, as a result of climate change, may negatively affect wheat grain yields -potentially increasing food insecurity and poverty. Wheat breeders will depend on the croṕs genetic diversity and modern genetic enhancement methods (both genomics and transgenics) for improving wheat yield and its stability. They should conservewheat germplasm, study it, add value to it, and share it in enhanced form with clients worldwide. While changes in plant architecture (dwarfism and harvest index), photoperiod response and breeding for host plant resistance (especially for rusts) led to the productivity gains of the Green Revolution, adaptation to climate change (water and heat stresses, emerging pathogens and pests), efficient input use, food safety and quality, are additional global challenges to be tackled to fit newly bred-genotypes into sustainable and improved wheat farming in this 21st Century. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",About Sufficiency
New Regimes of Responsibilization: Practicing Product Carbon Footprinting in the New Carbon Economy,"This article discusses how by voluntarily adopting new dimensions of corporate responsibility-for the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by its products-global retailers not only position their organizations as responsible in the battle to win the hearts, minds, and wallets of their consumers, but also articulate a new solution for the mitigation of climate change aligned with their commercial interests. As part of this solution, retailers (and other brands) reimagined how GHG emissions should be allocated-shifting from a productionist-based to a consumptionist-based perspective-and redefined what they are responsible for and what their supply chains must care about. The article argues that the complexity involved in engaging tens, hundreds, or even thousands of individual organizations across numerous products' supply chains means that requirements to measure and reduce a product's carbon footprint cannot, and are not, simply pushed down a supply chain. Rather through a confluence of the practices of translation, observation, and normalization retailers are creating, fostering, and articulating new regimes of responsibilization within which actors across successive tiers of a product's supply chains must measure, monitor, and reduce their own carbon footprints independently, conscientiously, and diligently, thereby enabling retailers to achieve carbon reductions at a distance. Seen through the Foucauldian-inspired lens of the technologies of the self and self-government under neoliberal governance regimes, this article suggests that, through the control of what is in a product's carbon footprint, how this should be measured, and how it should be reduced-what are called here carbon truths-global retailers are working to consolidate their socioeconomic powers as sustainability leaders that fundamentally direct society's response to, and mitigation of, climate change. © 2015 Clark University.",About Sufficiency
Framework For a Collective Definition of Regenerative Agriculture in India,"The concept of regenerative agriculture has received increasing attention worldwide as a method to restore and conserve natural resources while maintaining crop productivity. However, there remains a lack of consensus as to what conditions define regenerative agriculture, making it difficult for decision-makers, researchers, the agricultural sector, and the public to adopt regenerative agri culture practices. Here, we present the initial process to create a unified, cross-sectoral definition for regenerative agriculture in India that considers the viewpoints of multiple stakeholders and addresses the current challenges faced by the Indian agricultural sector. To this end, we compiled interactions with individuals from across India to identify the most pressing concerns for India’s human and environmental ecosystems. We conducted over 30 hours of workshops to discuss these concerns with 50 experts from five sectors and four countries. We summarize these discussions and propose a common framework to collaboratively develop region-specific techniques that employ existing and supplementary resources to generate evidence for regenerative agriculture and foster conducive practices. © Olsson, Ameen, Bajpai, Gudasalamani, Gajjar, Gupta, Hvilshøj, Krishnakumar, Lobo, Mukerjee, Naik, Raghavan, Singh and Subaharan 2022.",About Sufficiency
Aquaculture performance in Indonesia: Economics and social perspectives,"Aquaculture is one of the fisheries sub-sectors that play a strategic role in national development. Currently, the aquaculture sector contributes significantly to both food security and national economic growth. This study aims to analyze the performance of aquaculture in 6 major islands located in Indonesia at the period of 2010 to 2018. The research was carried out with quantitative and qualitative approaches using descriptive analysis, taking into account economic and social aspects. Economic aspects were measured by five variable indicators, namely Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and aquaculture production volume, budget value, aquaculture land area and the number of fish farmer households. Social aspects were measured based on five variables of fish cultivator exchange rate (NTPi), budget value, price index received by fish cultivation, household consumption index, production cost index. The results showed that the contribution of aquaculture was fairly significant toward the achievement of national development goals, although not all indicators were able to achieve the set targets. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",About Sufficiency
"Deciphering the connection: Exploring the relationship between finance, trade, and urbanization in the ecological fabric of African economies","This study contributes to the Sustainable Development Goal 15 by examining the dynamics of balancing the ecological footprint and meeting fundamental human needs in terms of food and shelter. The analysis utilizes a panel dataset comprising 9 countries with ecological deficits, covering the period from 1971 to 2022. The estimators employed in the study are robust to cross-sectional dependence and allow for heterogeneous slope coefficients. The findings, based on the FE-DK and MMQR models, provide empirical evidence supporting the ecological deficit hypothesis. The validity of the ecological deficit hypothesis is verified by the inverted U-shaped nexus between economic growth and ecological deficits. Finance plays a mitigating role in reducing the ecological deficit for food, but it is associated with higher levels of deficit for shelter, particularly at the upper quantile. Trade openness exacerbates the ecological deficit for food, but it helps reduce the deficit for shelter. Robustness analysis, conducted using the half-panel jackknife multivariate Wald-type test, confirms that the covariates exhibit Granger-causal relationships with the ecological deficit. Bidirectional causal relationships are observed between the ecological deficit for food and squared economic growth. Additionally, bidirectional relationships exist between trade and urban population and the ecological footprint for shelter. The findings offer useful insights for policymakers and stakeholders that are working towards achieving sustainable development. © 2025 The Author(s).

Socio-economic and environmental implications of Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) on agriculture and livelihoods,"Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) activities continue to grow in many resource-endowed countries with ASM-generated revenues serving as a precursor to socio-economic growth especially in mineral-rich rural communities. However, the rapid proliferation of this extractive activity into new frontiers often extends to territories where, traditionally, agricultural activities may already be present. Considering the destructive effects of the ASM life cycle on the environment, concerns have been raised regarding the negative agricultural impacts of ASM. Thus in this paper, we review the Janus-faced nature of ASM as discourses have developed in the burgeoning literature. Our review reveals an emerging narrative suggesting that in some instances ASM and agriculture complement each other with beneficial consequences. Nevertheless, this highly informal type of mining can have deleterious effects on agriculture through three main mechanisms: land degradation and farm invasions, water and mercury pollution, and the Dutch disease phenomenon – the shift of labour from the agriculture sector to the ASM sector. As most of the operations of small-scale mineral extractors take place in rural communities where agriculture is the main source of livelihood, we find the creation of vulnerabilities in the agrarian economy through these mechanisms. Considering the economic importance of the two sectors to livelihoods, stakeholders would need to recast resources policy to ensure the proper accommodation of both sectors especially in the rural economic space. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Sustainable Green Marketing Strategies for a Circular Economy in Africa: A Conclusion,"The status of green marketing implementation and achievements in Africa point to a bleak future. There is general consensus in extant literature that the African continent is lagging behind in attaining environmental sustainability targets (Asongu & Odhiambo, 2021; Aluko et al., 2023). Empirical evidence also suggests that the African continent is warming more rapidly as compared to other continents (Avom et al., 2020; Aluko et al., 2023). This, according to Avom et al. (2020), is manifested by the escalation of climate change-induced grand problems such as droughts, floods, poverty, forced migration, health pandemics and social inequalities. Moreover, the growing rate of unemployment characterised by de-industrialisation and rapid informalisation of African economies is at odds with the green marketing promise of green economic growth (Asongu & Odhiambo, 2021). This further raises doubt about the potential of green marketing as a driver of economy growth in Africa. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",About Sufficiency
Sustainable food systems under environmental footprints: The delicate balance from farm to table,"In today's world, agriculture is not only about food production but also a critical factor in global environmental change, economic stability, and human health, among other aspects. With population growth and increasingly scarce resources, exploring sustainable development of food systems has become crucial. Achieving this goal requires striking a delicate balance among food security, economic development, ecological environment, and human health. Traditional approaches to sustainable agricultural development research often focus solely on singular domains, overlooking the inherent connections and interactions among environmental, socioeconomic, and health dimensions. This perspective limits our comprehensive understanding of food systems. Environmental footprint assessments can be integrated with economic, systemic, and decision models to analyze environmental, socioeconomic, and health issues within food systems. This integration accurately captures the diversity, overlap, accumulation, and heterogeneity of environmental pressures resulting from human and natural factors. Therefore, we propose an innovative conceptual framework that considers environmental, socioeconomic, and health dimensions as crucial components, with the environmental footprint indicators at its core, to link various stages from farm to table. This framework constructs an evidence gap map, integrating dispersed data and perspectives from existing literature, thus showing knowledge gaps across these domains. Such an interdisciplinary approach not only provides a more comprehensive perspective on the multidimensional complexity of sustainable food systems but also reveals potential synergies and conflicts among environmental, socioeconomic, and health domains, thereby guiding more comprehensive and cautious policy-making. Importantly, it provides direction for future research to achieve the sustainable development of food systems, emphasizing the necessity of a comprehensive, integrated research perspective, particularly in strengthening studies on composited footprints, viewing the entire farm-to-table continuum holistically. Stakeholders must collaborate and coordinate environmental, socioeconomic, and health objectives to drive the sustainable development of food systems. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency
The hierarchy of resource use for a sustainable circular economy,"Purpose: The original principles of the hierarchy of resource use seem to have been forgotten. The purpose of this paper is to address the necessity of these principles in order for a circular economy (CE) to be sustainable. Design/methodology/approach: This is a general review paper explaining today’s shortcomings in a CE and in the waste hierarchy. Its theoretical contribution is illustrated using the example of marine plastic waste in the Arctic, as well as the EU’s action plan for a CE: “Closing the loop”. Findings: There is a need to reduce raw materials into the economy directly and not only as a potential result of recycling. This is supported theoretically and by illustrating that the EU’s action plan is closing the loop primarily from the output side. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical possibility of complete recycling rests on a premise that is now at odds with a sustainable development. Social implications: The power of existing raw material production cycles must be challenged to allow reduction to be a real option. If not, a CE may exacerbate a moral trade-off by the current generation reducing the safe operating space of future living beings. Originality/value: The theoretical possibility of recycling everything, also known as the technology-optimist view, has played the role of a safety net for humanity. As we are now exceeding planetary boundaries for a safe and just space for humanity, this theoretical safety net is no longer valid. Instead, we must reinforce the basic principles of the hierarchy of resource use. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",About Sufficiency
The contribution of small-scale food production in urban areas to the sustainable development goals: a review and case study,"Food production depends upon the adequate provision of underpinning ecosystem services, such as pollination. Paradoxically, conventional farming practices are undermining these services and resulting in degraded soils, polluted waters, greenhouse gas emissions and massive loss of biodiversity including declines in pollinators. In essence, farming is undermining the ecosystem services it relies upon. Finding alternative more sustainable ways to meet growing food demands which simultaneously support biodiversity is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Here, we review the potential of urban and peri-urban agriculture to contribute to sustainable food production, using the 17 sustainable development goals set by the United Nations General Assembly as a framework. We present new data from a case study of urban gardens and allotments in the city of Brighton and Hove, UK. Such urban and peri-urban landholdings tend to be small and labour-intensive, characterised by a high diversity of crops including perennials and annuals. Our data demonstrate that this type of agricultural system can be highly productive and that it has environmental and social advantages over industrial agriculture in that crops are usually produced using few synthetic inputs and are destined for local consumption. Overall, we conclude that food grown on small-scale areas in and near cities is making a significant contribution to feeding the world and that this type of agriculture is likely to be relatively favourable for some ecosystem services, such as supporting healthy soils. However, major knowledge gaps remain, for example with regard to productivity, economic and employment impacts, pesticide use and the implications for biodiversity. © 2020, The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
Natural resource extraction and household welfare in rural Laos,"Degradation of natural resources is a threat to sustainable development in many developing countries. Solving this requires an understanding of the factors affecting the extraction of and the dependence on the resources as well as the impacts on rural welfare. In this study, we identify the factors affecting the extraction of and the dependence on forest and water resources and examine the impacts of the extraction on rural household welfare in Laos. We address our research questions with an econometric framework that models the extraction and its implications simultaneously. We use the data of 430 rural households from a survey undertaken in 2013 in 38 villages of Savannakhet Province. Our findings show that extracting forest and water resources is a shock-coping strategy of rural households but contributes to reducing household income inequality. For extracting households, the extraction increases household income, consumption, and food security. However, for nonextracting households, although participating in the extraction would increase food security, it would reduce their income and consumption. We suggest that promoting rural education and off-farm employment opportunities and enhancing investments in physical infrastructures would reduce the extraction of and the dependence on the resources of extractors and prevent nonextractors from being forced to extract the resources. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Achieving food security in a climate change environment: Considerations for environmental kuznets curve use in the South African agricultural sector,"This study relates agricultural income and agricultural carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the context of environmental Kuznets curves for South Africa. We posit likely relationships between UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 1, 2 and 13, relating food production to climate change action. CO2 emissions, income, coal energy consumption and electricity energy consumption time series data from 1990 to 2012 within the South African agricultural sector were used. The autoregressive distributive lag bounds-test and the error correction model were used to analyse the data. The results show long-run relationships. However, agricultural income was only significant in the linear and squared models. Changes in agricultural CO2 emissions from the short run towards the long run are estimated at 71.9%, 124.7% and 125.3% every year by the linear, squared and cubic models, respectively. Exponentially increasing agricultural income did not result in a decrease in agricultural CO2 emissions, which is at odds with the Kuznets hypothesis. The study concludes that it will be difficult for South Africa to simultaneously achieve SDGs 1, 2 and 13, especially given that agriculture is reliant upon livestock production, the largest CO2 emitter in the sector. The sector needs to shift to renewable energy consumption with fewer CO2 emissions. © 2019 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Finding a path for REDD+ between ODA and the CDM,"A new financing mechanism known as REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) is being established to achieve large-scale reductions in GHG emissions from tropical forestry and land use. Can REDD+ successfully integrate an emphasis on sustainable development benefits (as with Official Development Assistance, ODA) with a focus on delivering emission reductions (as with the Clean Development Mechanism, CDM)? It is argued that there is a real risk that REDD+ will stay too close to ODA and fail to move beyond its 'readiness' phase. Moreover, as with the CDM, there could be an over-emphasis on results in terms of emission reductions, which would only make it attractive for a small set of activities in relatively few countries. In order to balance sustainable development with cost-effective emission reductions, REDD+ needs to involve the private sector in project implementation and financing, its rules for reference levels and crediting arrangements need to be flexible, and forest countries need to proactively direct activities.Policy relevance REDD+ has the potential to deliver funding at an unprecedented scale for forestry and land use activities in developing countries. However, this will only occur if the mechanism can successfully transition from its current readiness phase (which is similar to ODA) to a results-based REDD+phase (which implies similarities with the CDM). A framework for analysing the attractiveness of results-based REDD+ for both forest and funder countries is provided. It is argued that the interests of forest and funder countries coincide when there are activities that score well with respect to financing and co-funding requirements, socio-economic impacts, and governance implications, within the context of each forest country's policy environment and capabilities. An early case study of a results-based REDD+ transaction, the Indonesian logging moratorium, suggests this conceptual framework provides an effective decision support tool to help design future REDD+ policy interventions to avoid the various pitfalls of ODA and the CDM. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",About Sufficiency
Fair pricing in tourism: From profitability towards sustainability,"Fair pricing used to refer to the problem of the buyer’s judgement of a seller’s price decision. Nowadays, when sustainability becomes a vital and fundamental consideration of tourism development, fair pricing should be discussed in a much wider context. The ethical context of fair pricing in tourism should be emphasised, as it is recognised as one of the transparent and ethical practices of tourism enterprises. In consequence, fair pricing is a significant element of corporate social responsibility and supports other goals like the beneficial partnerships of tourism enterprises with local communities and suppliers, providing equal opportunities and remuneration for the employees of tourism enterprises, as well as increasing the sustainable treatment of scarce natural resources. Fair pricing relates not only to the judgement of tourists (price versus value), but also to the opinion of the employees of tourism enterprises (price related to salaries), suppliers (price of finished product related to prices of raw materials and services), local communities (price versus income), and other stakeholders dependant on tourism industry in different ways. Finally, fair pricing must solve the issue of so-called “cheap nature”. This means that fair pricing relates to a valuation of ecosystem services, as tourism “consumes” environmental assets and significantly influences the cultural landscape. In consequence, fair pricing might contribute to the protection of bio-and geodiversity, climate, and cultural landscape. The aim of the chapter is to: (1) define fair pricing and discuss the evolutionary changes of the definition; (2) highlight the emerging importance of fair pricing in tourism; (3) review the theoretical concepts, empirical results, and practical applications of fair pricing; and (4) discuss the contribution of fair pricing to achieving sustainable development goals for tourism. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Alastair M.

Operationalising transboundary cooperation through game theory: An energy water food nexus approach for the Middle East and North Africa,"The Middle East and North African (MENA) countries are subject to natural and anthropogenic stressors that inhibit environmental conservation, economic development and social stability, creating a potential for socio-economic disparities between them. The current parochialistic approach adopted by majority of the MENA countries continues to foster competition, despite the complementary relationships that can potentially arise between their resource systems. Consequently, food security is one area which is vastly suffering at unprecedented scales threatening the prosperity in the MENA region. On the other hand, the MENA countries share similar socio-economic and geo-political characteristics, and therein lies an opportunity to create a novel strategic ecosystem for enhancing cooperation between them to achieve greater resilience in regional food security. In this paper, the tools used to model competition and the enabling mechanisms for cooperative approaches were reviewed, including applications of non-cooperative and cooperative game theory in EWF nexus systems. A real-life example of the usefulness of game theoretic models is illustrated through a transboundary EWF nexus-based cooperative framework which links the available resources and assets in the MENA region and offers a fertile field to enhance food security and greater socio-economic and environmental resilience in the region. © 2023 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Food security and multicommodity agricultural international trade: Quantifying optimal consumer subsidies for nutritional needs,"Hundreds of millions of people are now facing food insecurity as challenges from climate change, the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and strife and conflicts make availability of food at reasonable prices challenging.

"Equity, climate justice and fossil fuel extraction: principles for a managed phase out","Equity issues have long been debated within international climate politics, focused on fairly distributing reductions in territorial emissions and fossil fuel consumption. There is a growing recognition among scholars and policymakers that curbing fossil fuel supply (as well as demand) can be a valuable part of the climate policy toolbox; this raises the question of where and how the tool should be applied. This paper explores how to equitably manage the social dimensions of a rapid transition away from fossil fuel extraction. Fossil fuel extraction leads to benefits for some people (such as extraction workers) and harms for others (such as pollution-affected communities). A transition must respect and uphold the rights of both groups, while also staying within climate limits, as climate impacts will fall most heavily on the world’s poor. This paper begins by reviewing how extraction affects economies and communities and the different transitional challenges they face. Based on that review, it then examines three common equity approaches–economic efficiency, meeting development needs, and effort-sharing. Drawing lessons from the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, the paper proposes five principles as a basis for equitably curbing fossil fuel extraction within climate limits: (1) Phase out global extraction at pace consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C; (2) Enable a just transition for workers and communities; (3) Curb extraction consistent with environmental justice; (4) Reduce extraction fastest where doing so will have the least social costs; (5) Share transition costs fairly, according to ability to bear those costs. Key policy insights: Fossil fuel extraction is unlikely to be a viable path to development because the Paris Agreement goals require most fossil fuel use to be ended within a generation; Extraction should be phased out fastest in diversified, wealthier economies that can better absorb the transitional impacts; Governments of extracting countries should enact ambitious industrial policy to diversify their economies, alongside economic and employment policies to enable a just transition; The costs of a just transition should be borne by those most able to bear it: poorer countries can reasonably demand financial support. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",About Sufficiency
Environmental fiscal reforms through decentralisation for sustainable development and poverty eradication,"Environment degradation and augmentation of poverty are causing a serious peril not only for the present but also for future generations. The situation is aggravated day by day. This is mainly due to the distortion in the market systems.

The devolution of power is a step forward, but it requires corresponding fiscal decentralisation, institutional development, and political will. The lower tiers of government have meagre resources and poor skills, infrastructure, and institutions, which need improvement. EFR can generate benefits in terms of fiscal revenue, environmental outcomes, and poverty reduction in local districts.

Climate change and agricultural productivity: Economic implications for food security,"Since the late 20th century, there has been an increasing focus on the impact of climate change on various sectors, including agriculture. Consequently, it is crucial to assess how the negative effects of climate change can be mitigated to ensure food security. This study evaluated the relationship between agriculture, food security, and CO2 emissions. In particular, a correlation analysis was conducted between selected indicators for three countries: Kazakhstan, the United States of America, and Germany, as a representative of European Union countries. The study demonstrated that rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and the increased frequency of extreme weather events significantly disrupt agricultural productivity, posing substantial risks to global food security. These issues were compounded by the need to adapt agricultural methods and technologies to new climatic realities, which often require significant financial and human resources, particularly in developing countries with limited resources. Conclusions drawn from statistical data revealed mixed results: for Kazakhstan, the positive impact of agriculture on food security was confirmed, while CO2 emissions had an ambiguous effect on food security indicators. The findings of this study can be used to inform strategies for future development, both by enterprises and by the state as a whole. Copyright © The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
Whether curse or blessing: A counterintuitive perspective on global pest thrips infestation under climatic change with implications to agricultural economics,"The improvement and application of pest models to predict yield losses is still a challenge for the scientific community. However, pest models were targeted chiefly towards scheduling scouting or pesticide applications to deal with pest infestation. Thysanoptera (thrips) significantly impact the productivity of many economically important crops worldwide. Until now, no comprehensive study is available on the global distribution of pest thrips, as well as on the extent of cropland vulnerability worldwide. Further, nothing is known about the climate change impacts on these insects. Thus the present study was designed to map the global distribution and quantify the extent of cropland vulnerability in the present and future climate scenarios using data of identified pest thrips within the genus, i.e., Thrips, Frankliniella, and Scirtothrips. Our found significant niche contraction under the climate change scenarios and thrips may reside primarily in their thermal tolerance thresholds. About 3,98,160 km2 of cropland globally was found to be affected in the present scenario. However, it may significantly reduce to 5530 Km2 by 2050 and 1990 km2 by 2070. Further, the thrips distribution mostly getting restricted to Eastern North America, the North-western of the Indian sub-continent, and the north of Europe. Among all realms, thrips may lose ground in the Indo-Malayan realm at the most and get restricted to only 27 out of 825 terrestrial ecoregions. The agrarian communities of the infested regions may get benefit if these pests get wiped out, but on the contrary, we may lose species diversity. Moreover, the vacated niche may attract other invasive species, which may seriously impact the species composition and agricultural productivity. The present study findings can be used in making informed decisions about prioritizing future economic and research investments on the thrips in light of anticipated climate change impacts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
"Biofuels, Food Security, and the Environment: A 2020/2050 Perspective","This chapter explores the impacts that rapid growth in biofuel demand has on agricultural prices, the consumption levels of key staple commodities, and the resulting impacts on food security and nutrition. The results clearly show a “food-versus-fuel” tradeoff that any national plan for biofuel expansion should take into account. Intensified biofuel production would likely increase the number of malnourished people. Rapid biofuel expansion also has a significant impact on international trade, particularly the global trade balance of maize. In addition, the results indicate that expansion of biofuels would increase the stress on regional water supplies only marginally; however, a significant expansion of biofuel production in areas facing water scarcity could exacerbate the problem. Aside from food security concerns, the expansion of biofuels entails additional tradeoffs with environmental sustainability, and the goals of overall economic growth and poverty reduction. © 2010, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",About Sufficiency
Introduction,"Cities are the largest structure humans build. An ""ecocity"" is an ecologically healthy city. Born from urban ecology and rooted in bioregionalism, the ecocity movement quest to evolve ecocities is three-fold: (i) reduce overall demand for energy and materials within a city through social innovation coupled with intelligent design, (ii) improve access to resources by all who need it, and (iii) re-generate natural habitat to secure local and global ecosystem integrity. This book represents the state of practice in ecocity development utilizing case studies from Africa, Asia, North and South America. The content revolves around a core theme of building socially just and ecologically sustainable cities and then drills into three sub-themes addressing: climate action, circular economy, and informal solutions for sustainable development. The chapters illustrate concepts from the Ecocity Standards, a diagnostic tool evolved from a holistic understanding of Earth's socio-ecological systems for maintaining homeostasis. Ecocity Standards help cities assess their progress on the path to becoming ecocities. The chapters provide an orientation to the importance of engaging people, where they live, in ecocity transformations as well as emerging opportunities for affordable and accessible technologies that build capacity for implementation of ecocity initiatives. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license.

Global Prosperity and Sustainable Development Goals,"Negotiations around Sustainable Development Goals and the post-2015 development agenda should go beyond just re-writing goals and targets that adhere to 'sustaining' the same old economic and social models. Instead, societies and governments should take this as an opportunity to advance more radical conceptual and practical approaches that challenge this reductive understanding of 'sustainability'. The paper argues that we should turn our attention to prosperity rather than to development per se, recognising the critical role political and social innovation should have in unleashing individuals' potential to flourishing in a context of finite resources. The interwoven, interdependent and ever-evolving nature of socio-ecological systems, together with the uncertainties and 'unknowns' that characterise contemporary reality, questions the relevance of one-size-fits-all goals. There is no single route to prosperity; diversity of objectives is essential and fundamental.

Is agriculture compatible with free trade?,"This article examines the relationship of free trade with agriculture in view of agriculture's distinctive features in the following three ways. First, agriculture produces a wide array of local and national nonmarket goods and services (in addition to market commodities) collectively known as multifunctionality of agriculture. Second, agriculture is intimately associated with global public goods of grave importance to humanity such as climate change, sustainability, and food security (poverty/hunger) in developing countries that require transnational cooperation to minimize free-rider and consequent under-provision problems. Third, embodying the first and second problems, agriculture plays distinctively different roles across countries. Specifically, this article views the global agriculture as consisting of four broad groups of countries with widely divergent needs from agriculture. This article concludes that the above agriculture-related problems are too diverse and complex to be left to free trade. When the global community is too much preoccupied with the illusive mission of agricultural trade liberalization, the great danger is that such preoccupation may distract it from effectively addressing the agriculture-related problems of the 21st century in a timely manner that pose imperative challenges to humanity. The governance for global agriculture should prioritize managing/taming such global problems rather than squandering time for unworkable liberalization of agricultural trade. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Social and environmental impacts of agricultural cooperatives: Evidence from Ethiopia,"Cooperatives are considered as potential organizational vehicles for sustainable development due to their multiple objectives and diverse roles. In particular, a lot is expected from agricultural cooperatives since they depend mainly on natural resource-based activities where sustainability issues are central concerns. Using household survey data of 305 coffee farmers from Ethiopia, the impacts of cooperative membership on farmers social and environmental performances are examined. Findings, based on propensity scores matching, show a significant positive impact of cooperatives on members social capital including trust, commitment and satisfaction, and on human capital such as training sessions received and experiences gained. However, farmers environmental performance is negatively associated with membership contrary to expectations. The findings suggest further efforts that need to be made by agricultural cooperatives to improve the environmental performance of farmers, while the accumulated human and social capitals are encouraging and can ease future collective actions toward cares for the environment and future generations. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.",About Sufficiency
"Competition, regulation and the urban poor: A case study of water","Diana Mitlin INTRODUCTION This chapter explores the impact of regulation and competition policy on the poor. There are a number of anticipated influences both in regard to the poor as consumers and as producers and/or suppliers of goods and services. Potential areas of influence include the impact of regulation and competition policies on the price of basic commodities and services; the quality of commodities and services; opportunities for access to markets for commodities and services; changes in market opportunities for employment and enterprise development (both positive and negative); and changes in externalities such as environmental degradation, and health and safety. Such areas have an evident impact on the well-being of the poor, their capacity to avoid poverty and their development options. The study focuses on a single sector, water services, and considers the impacts for the urban poor. Water was selected because it is a basic need in maintaining life and improving well-being in the short, medium and long term. For the poor, the objective is access to affordable and adequate supplies of water to meet a multitude of needs. The significance of politics and policy in influencing outcomes such as access and affordability is emphasised by Spiller and Savedoff (1999, pp. 1-2): why is it so difficult to properly manage and operate water systems in the region, and more generally in the developing world? The problem is not related to project finance or lack of technical or manpower capabilities, but rather to the political economy of the sector…. © Paul Cook, Colin Kirkpatrick, Martin Minogue, David Parker 2004.",About Sufficiency
How can we drive sustainability transitions?,"Sustainability transitions are required to address challenges of climate change, economic development, ecological integrity, and social justice. Driving sustainability transitions is difficult but necessary work. We discuss sustainability challenges and the need for transitions, with a focus on the vital roles that change agents can play. These change agents exhibit a desire to make change happen. They encourage others to join them in their efforts. After discussing the work of change agents in driving sustainability transitions, we present a case study of change in Perth, Australia, where change agents have attained considerable success in placing that city on a path toward sustainable water management practices. We suggest sustainability transitions can be effectively enabled when change agents: (1) Clarify the problem and articulate a clear vision; (2) Engage others to identify workable solutions and implementation pathways; (3) Secure support from influential stakeholders; (4) Establish effective monitoring tools and learning systems; (5) Foster long-term relationships of trust and mutual support; and (6) Develop narratives that support on-going action. © 2022 The Author(s).

Changes in Australian agriculture and land use: Implications for future food security,"Food security debates have only recently emerged in Australia with the prediction that Australia's population could reach 35 million by 2050. In a country with limited productive arable land and a heavy reliance on inputs, the question is raised: 'Can and should Australia continue to export food and feed itself in the face of changes in the use and ownership of agricultural land, tighter water regulations, increasing input costs, declining numbers of farmers and rural labour, environmental degradation and a changing climate?' This paper examines the relative importance of these changes, using current information and future scenarios. A brief introduction to Australian agriculture describes the current production and trade environment. Land use and social and environmental changes are then analysed in terms of their impact on the role and future productive capacity of Australian agriculture. We conclude that despite recent declines in farmer populations, available agricultural land and water restrictions, Australia will continue to produce enough food for domestic and export markets at least in the short term with import substitutions as required. Longer term food security for Australia and its trade partners is likely to be threatened by climate impacts (e.g. droughts, flooding and cyclones), lack of planning controls over urban development and mining on productive land, shortages of skilled labour and underinvestment in agricultural research and development. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",About Sufficiency
Impact of climate-smart agriculture on the income and food security of cassava-producing households in the Savalou commune in Benin,"Climate disruption today represents a threat to the environment and sustainable development. Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an appropriate adaptation approach to climate change. It allows producers to improve their production and act on their food security, despite the conditions of climate change while limiting the causes arising from agriculture. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of CSA, through the use of harvest residues in cassava fields, on the income and food security of cassava producing households in Savalou. The three-stage sampling method made it possible to draw a random sample of 360 cassava producers including 180 users of pigeon pea, mucuna and peanut harvest residues. The average income from cassava production during the last 12 months (until July 2023) is 366,400 FCFA with 387,340 FCFA for beneficiaries compared to 322,060 FCFA for non-beneficiaries. The impact analysis was done with the matching method based on propensity scores. The results of this impact study showed that this adoption contributes to improving income from cassava production by 35,135 FCFA and household food security by 0.10 points, on average per household per year. It would therefore be useful to promote and improve this type of agriculture, in order to ensure sustainable development of the agricultural sector and improve food security. © The Author(s) 2024.",About Sufficiency
Water productivity and economic feasibility of drip irrigation system investment in tomato cultivation: Case of northeastern Tunisia,"Tunisia is characterized by water scarcity, growing water demand and considerable waste of this resource especially in the agricultural sector. To cope with this situation and enhance water productivity, appropriate utilization of advanced irrigation methods such as drip irrigation is highly needed. Hence, this research aims to evaluate the profitability of drip irrigation systems compared with surface irrigation systems at the perimeter of Echraf, which is located in the northeastern of Tunisia. Primary data were collected from 25 adopters of the Drip Irrigation System and 13 non-adopters. The results of the partial budget analysis revealed that the average total cost for adopters was higher than that for non-adopters. However, the net margin was higher for adopters than for non-adopters. This is due to the greater increase in gross revenue for adopters than for non-adopters. Additionally, drip irrigation resulted in more efficient water use and water values than did the surface irrigation system. Economic profitability analysis via the benefit cost ratio and net present value tools revealed that the drip irrigation system is profitable. The benefit cost ratio is equal to 1.65, and the net present value is approximately 2938 Tunisian National Dinar. Finally, the sensitivity analysis reveals the extent to which profitability is sensitive to the scenarios of subsidy levels. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Environmental Expectations, Socioeconomic Demands and Sustainability of the Zapatosa Marsh, Colombia: Perspectives from Local Stakeholders","The Zapatosa Marsh Complex (ZMC) is a strategic ecosystem in Colombia, under threat from human-driven factors such as population growth and subsistence extraction activities. Local residents experience high poverty levels and low educational attainment, exacerbating conflicts between their socio-economic needs and marsh conservation efforts. This study aimed to present a participatory approach to prioritize actions for sustainable development in Chimichagua, the municipality encompassing the largest part of the ZMC. We identified and characterized local stakeholders, engaging them in a participatory action research project to determine barriers and opportunities for economic growth and food security. The insights gathered were collaboratively used to formulate actions that balance the sustainability of the ZMC with local economic development. Stakeholders identified the ZMC as an opportunity for employment and raw materials, while pointing to poor support from territorial entities as the central barrier. A prioritized action was the construction of a concentrate feed production plant utilizing local raw materials. This work offers a methodological contribution that could be applied to address socio-economic and environmental conflicts in other strategic ecosystems. © 2024 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Egyptian Marine Fisheries and Its Sustainability,"The sustainable fisheries management and usage of aquatic resources, investing in the Blue Economy and implementation of ecosystem approaches can enhance economic development, raise food security, improve nutrition and decrease poverty. Fishery resources from marine and inland waters, together with aquaculture, deliver food, nutrition and consider an important income source to upto 820, 000, 000 people worldwide, from collecting, processing, marketing, and dissemination. For numerous coastal communities, it constitutes part of their traditional ethnic identity. Many threats face the sustainability of global fishery resources such as overfishing, pollution, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and recently the climate changes. In Egypt, fish production from natural resources and aquaculture plays a vital role in food security, livelihood, national GDP, poverty alleviation, and employment opportunities in rural areas. Egypt achieves fish production of about 1.9 million tons: 1.6 million tons from aquaculture, and about 0.3 million tons from natural resources. The natural resources in Egypt (marine and inland resources) had severely declined in the last decades; this enhanced the efforts to promote responsible and sustainable fisheries and aquaculture practices and preserve healthy marine environments. This chapter will describe the current status of Egyptian marine fisheries, will address the main challenges facing its development, and will give some practical solutions for its sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

"Sustainable food production: constraints, challenges and choices by 2050","The way we grow and consume food is changing both landscapes and societies globally. The constraints and challenges we face in meeting the anticipated large increase in global food demand out to 2050 are examined to show that while they present significant difficulties on many fronts, we have a large range of choices in the way this food demand might be met. Meeting this future food demand has frequently been articulated as a crisis of supply alone by some dominant institutions and individuals with prior ideological commitments to a particular framing of the food security issue. Our analysis indicates that the crisis can be avoided by the choices we make. The food security debate will be enriched by a rigorous evaluation of all these choices and recognition that the eventual solution will reside in a mixture of these choices. We could shift from our current paradigm of productivity enhancement while reducing environmental impacts, to a paradigm where ecological sustainability constitutes the entry point for all agricultural development. If we embraced this new paradigm, sustainable governance and management of ecosystems, natural resources and earth system processes at large, could provide the framework for practical solutions towards an intensification of agriculture. Such a paradigm shift could reposition world food production from its current role as the world’s single largest driver of global environmental change, to becoming a critical part of a world transition to work within the boundaries of the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the planet’s biophysical processes and functions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.",About Sufficiency
Research needs for a food system transition,"The global food system, and animal agriculture in particular, is a major and growing contributor to climate change, land system change, biodiversity loss, water consumption and contamination, and environmental pollution. The copious production and consumption of animal products are also contributing to increasingly negative public health outcomes, particularly in wealthy and rapidly industrializing countries, and result in the slaughter of trillions of animals each year. These impacts are motivating calls for reduced reliance on animal-based products and increased use of replacement plant-based products. However, our understanding of how the production and consumption of animal products, as well as plant-based alternatives, interact with important dimensions of human and environment systems is incomplete across space and time. This inhibits comprehensively envisioning global and regional food system transitions and planning to manage the costs and synergies thereof. We therefore propose a cross-disciplinary research agenda on future target-based scenarios for food system transformation that has at its core three main activities: (1) data collection and analysis at the intersection of animal agriculture, the environment, and societal well-being, (2) the construction of target-based scenarios for animal products informed by these new data and empirical understandings, and (3) the evaluation of impacts, unintended consequences, co-benefits, and trade-offs of these target-based scenarios to help inform decision-making. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",About Sufficiency
Can Drones Help Smallholder Farmers Improve Agriculture Efficiencies and Reduce Food Insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa? Local Perceptions from Malawi,"Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa play a vital role in achieving food security and nutrition, yet they are often overlooked by development policies and lack access to the technology and information needed to increase their agricultural productivity. This is particularly true in Malawi, where smallholder farmers make up over 80% of the population and face a range of risks and challenges, including vulnerability to climate change, that threaten their livelihoods, food security, and nutrition. While drones and precision agriculture technology have had a significant impact on agriculture in high-income countries, their application by smallholder farmers in low-income countries is not well understood. This study, conducted in 2022, examines how drones can assist smallholder farmers in increasing their agricultural productivity and food security in Malawi. It explores how smallholders perceive the use of drones and the potential benefits and limitations of using drones in their farming operations. A unique aspect of this study aims to understand smallholders’ perceptions of open data and data privacy. The results show that when smallholder farmers interact with drone data, they have a better understanding of their farm and are able to make more informed decisions that use fewer inputs and reduce production costs. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential for drones to assist smallholder farmers improve their on-farm knowledge, increase agricultural productivity, and mitigate the risks and challenges they face, leading to improved livelihoods and a more sustainable and secure food supply. Policymakers can promote the adoption of drone technology among smallholder farmers by developing policies that encourage public–private partnerships to create affordable, locally adapted drone technologies and programs that meet their unique needs, while also ensuring responsible use of drones in agriculture through regulations that address concerns about data privacy and security. © 2023 by the authors.",About Sufficiency

"Biofuels, Land Grabbing and Food Security in Africa","The issue of biofuels has already been much debated, but the focus to date has largely been on Latin America and deforestation - this highly original work breaks fresh ground in looking at the African perspective. Most African governments see biofuels as having the potential to increase agricultural productivity and export incomes and thus strengthen their national economies, improving energy balances and rural employment. At the same time climate change may be addressed through reduction of green house gas emissions. There are, however, a number of uncertainties mounting that challenge this scenario. Using cutting-edge empirical case studies, this knowledge gap is addressed in a variety of chapters examining the effects of large-scale biofuel production on African agriculture. In particular, 'land grabbing' and food security issues are scrutinised, both of which have become vital topics in regard to the environmental and developmental governance of African countries.

"Trade, Transboundary Pollution, and Foreign Lobbying","In this paper, we explore the use of trade policy in addressing transboundary stock pollution problems such as acid rain and water pollution. We show that a tariff determined by the current level of accumulated pollution can induce the time path of emissions optimal for the downstream (polluted) country. But if the upstream (polluting) country can lobby the downstream government to impose lower tariffs, distortions brought by corruption and foreign lobbying lead to a rise in the upstream country’s social welfare, and to a decrease in social welfare in the downstream country. Thus, the usefulness of trade policy as a tool for encouraging cooperation and internalizing transboundary externalities depends critically on the degree of governments’ susceptibility to foreign political influence. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",About Sufficiency
Can the implementation of the Water-Energy-Food nexus support economic growth in the Mediterranean region? The current status and the way forward,"Water resources is a crucial environmental good for the function of the human societies and the ecosystems. Moreover, water is an important input for the economy and an indispensable factor for economic growth. Especially in regions that are facing water scarcity, the adoption of water management policies and approaches fostering the sustainable use of resources while promoting economic growth becomes an emerging issue. The Mediterranean region is one of the most vulnerable regions regarding the availability of water resources due to climate change and human activities. The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus offers an integrated approach analyzing the synergies and trade-offs between the different sectors in order to maximize the efficiency of using the resources, whereas adapting optimum policies and institutional arrangements. The Mediterranean is a region where we observe a large spectrum of issues emanating from water pollution and natural resource degradation to water scarcity, large amounts of food loss and waste and increasing demand for energy and food. Agricultural practices, urban development, demand management for water, and protection of ecosystems, particularly aquatic ecosystems, are areas of particular intervention available to the decision-makers in enhancing availability of water for the various water using sectors. In this context, the current policy note paper aims to address a major issue: how can the implementation of the WEF Nexus support the economic growth in the Mediterranean? Based on the outcome of an experts and stakeholders regional workshop, this paper presents the current status, including the opportunities and the practices of applying the WEF Nexus in the Mediterranean and draws specific recommendations for the way forward. Regarding the later, the strengthening of WEF Nexus in the Mediterranean requires a set of interventions to strengthen the institutional capacities, to enhance the finance mechanisms, to support the intra-regional dialogue as well, to enhance data collection and management, as well as to implement economic instruments and integrated economic approaches to measure the impact of Nexus into economy and employment. © 2019 Markantonis, Reynaud, Karabulut, El Hajj, Altinbilek, Awad, Bruggeman, Constantianos, Mysiak, Lamaddalena, Matoussi, Monteiro, Pistocchi, Pretato, Tahboub, Tunçok, ünver, Van Ek, Willaarts, Bülent, Zakir and Bidoglio.",About Sufficiency

Biosecurity aspects in commercial Kappaphycus alvarezii farming industry: An India case study,"The commercial farming of Kappaphycus alvarezii in Indian waters has provided diversifying livelihood to the low-income artisanal fishermen for last 15 years. The sector has got commercial setback due to mass mortality of germplasm during 2013 – 2014. But considering its potential to provide inclusive economic growth in coastal rural settings, the government has renewed its interest in this activity. At the cusp of the strategic expansion of the seaweed sector understanding biosecurity risks, strategies and enforcement of framework is pivotal in reducing the impact of disease outbreaks, epiphytic infestations and pest attacks. The key category aspects include identification of the risks, evaluate the national health management for seaweed aquaculture, and providing potential biosecurity strategy for expanding commercial farming operations. Additionally we also enlisted the biosecurity strategy from other eucheumatoid-producing countries and nations involved in seaweed aquaculture for comparison. In-spite of advancements in science and technology, particularly in seaweed application-based solutions, health management and seaweed aquaculture biosecurity, still remain in their infancy in India. The analysis revealed that there is a complete absence of a national database of diseases, epiphytes, and grazers outbreak. Further limited clarity on a legal administrative procedures for the import of seaweed germplasm for commercial exploitation and its subsequent quarantine is a critical biosecurity risk. There is an urgent need to invest considerably in research and development related to the biosecurity of seaweeds. The rapid internet based technological development could be effectively utilised in disease reporting as well as developing farmer centric syndromic surveillance. The strengthening of regulatory frameworks and policy should be given the highest priority, as application of biosecurity has indirect effects in domains such as products development, food security, agriculture productivity, economic growth and potential regulatory ecosystem services. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Smart city and technology transfer: towards sustainable infrastructure in bahrain,"This paper aims to review the role of smart city innovation for sustainable infrastructure in Bahrain. It studies people’s perception and awareness about the smart city. The paper articulates the imperatives for harnessing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for smart infrastructure. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain is a member of GCC) face key challenges in water, energy and food security. This is exacerbated by climate change and energy dependence in spite of the region’s potential for solar and wind power and, in some cases, hydropower. Smart city innovations offer new possibilities for innovations to address the challenges in infrastructure. Technological innovations transform natural resources to serve human development. Green energy and ICT are becoming increasingly important in providing energy security and contributing to alleviating climate change risks. Hence, a transition to an innovative economy requires innovation in processes and technologies in infrastructure.

"Achieving sustainability and biodiversity conservation in agriculture: Importance, challenges and prospects","Concerns over the two-legged march towards sustainability and biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes have sparked debates globally; both in research and development, socioeconomics and policy planning. While others argue that sustainable and biodiversity conserving agriculture is impractical, an increasing body of evidence continues to recognise the importance of biodiversity for human survival and environmental stability. Because of this recognition, the UN decided to integrate and prioritise biodiversity conservation in its sustainable development goals. Although the concept of biodiversity is recognised as a potential coping strategy for climate change and crop production challenges; the practicality of its integration in agriculture remains a challenge. In this paper, some of the important prospects that can support and facilitate biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes are briefly discussed. While we recognise that the path to sustainability is not going to be easy, we emphasise the need for integrated research from both the sectors of agriculture and conservation to be prioritised, to reconcile productive sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation. Such research should target trade-offs and synergies which can make it possible for these sectors to coexist and survive in their coexistence. This will be highly beneficial to facilitate and guide the sustainability and conservation policy planning. © 2020 The Authors.",About Sufficiency
Climate neutral agri-food products in relation to sustainable supply chain,"One of the basic requirements for sustainability is to focus upon the entire lifecycle of the product. In the agri-food sector, companies which achieve climate neutral agri-food products are distinguished by climate-neutral labels, in recognition of their social responsibility and contribution to environment protection. Valid CO2 certificates which minimize climate-impacting emissions include the right to achieve net zero carbon emissions by offsetting or buying enough carbon credits to achieve carbon neutral, or having a net zero carbon footprint. Furthermore, value adding can be achieved in the customer-driven value creation chains, as more and more consumers are becoming aware of the company's contribution in environmental protection. In this respect, the aim of this study is to shed light in the specific attributes and perspectives of such practices and to explore how they can transform the challenge of climate change to opportunity for environment protection and sustainability. The paper highlights the need for successfully implemented climate neutral products and services, involving collaborative innovations which may also result in total cost reduction and product quality upgrading, particularly if incorporated in Sustainable or Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM). Moreover, social and company benefits can accrue especially for agri-food products which have already labels like protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI) and traditional specialty guaranteed (TSG). This paper also includes a survey conducted with consumers for assessing their behavioral patterns with regard to such issues. Finally, the major contribution of this study is the development of a conceptual model that presents the necessary managerial steps towards the production of green and climate neutral products.",About Sufficiency
Solar energy as an early just transition opportunity for coal-bearing states in India,"Continued investment in coal embroils regions in coal lock-ins, creating dependence and vested interests around coal and thereby limiting the speed and potential to switch to cleaner energy. In India, four states contribute 70% of coal production, with regions surrounding mines also housing significant operating and under-construction coal power stations. On the other hand, states in the west and south of India dominate current and near-term renewable energy capacity growth, broadly following patterns of highest resource potentials. We show that following current policies, by the end of the decade, coal-bearing states will likely sink deeper into carbon lock-ins, while the rest of the country, especially western and southern states could become increasingly decarbonised. Even in decarbonisation scenarios, gains from job and value creation in the clean energy sector might primarily take place away from existing coal regions, raising equity concerns, and ultimately putting the political feasibility of such a scenario in question. We suggest that policies aiming at higher renewable installations (mostly solar due to better potentials) in coal-bearing states, although not a one-to-one panacea, could provide an early break from lock-ins and into a just transition. This may, however, require a dedicated program and imply a small mark-up in power system costs. They would, however, help for medium-term diversification and job creation in all regions which will be key for assuring political support for the transition. © 2022 The Author(s).

Meta-analysis of the literature related to SDG 3 and its investment,"2020 revealed the vulnerability of the healthcare systems in most countries. It also highlighted their failure to generate serious progress in the fulfillment of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Ensure healthy lives and promote welfare for all at all ages. One of the key problems inhibiting its progress is the lack of financial resources. Based on a comprehensive meta-analysis of the literature related to SDG 3 and its investment, it aims to demonstrate that lack of appropriate academic support is a part of the failure to generate serious progress in the fulfillment of SDG 3. To do this academic literature published in the period 2010-2019 is analyzed. SciVal Elsevier, VosViewer, and Google Trends tools are applied for analysis. The results show that there is a significant interest in the academic circles on SDG 3 alone. However, this interest is concentrated toward its medical aspects while economic aspects, including investment, are poorly represented. This study shows that the reason for the current investment gap in SDG 3 is the lack of academic support to provide a theoretical, methodological, and analytical framework for tackling the financing problem for SDG 3. © Inna Makarenko, Alex Plastun, Mario Situm, Yuliia Serpeninova, Giuseppe Sorrentino, 2021",About Sufficiency
Towards a greener tomorrow: What role does fiscal policy play in fostering environmental sustainability in Pakistan?,"The concept of environmental sustainability has become a significant concern in the last several decades. The degradation of the environment has significant implications for human well-being, subsequently affecting productivity and economic growth. Consequently, achieving the goal of environmental sustainability emerges as a primary objective. The goal of this study is to develop an Environmental Sustainability Index that specifically targets factors related to air, land, and water. The second goal is to assess the short- and long-term impacts of fiscal policies on the environmental sustainability. The asymmetric influence of fiscal measures on sustainability is assumed in the present investigation. A time series data for the period 1974–2020 are used for the analysis. For the estimation of asymmetric effects, the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) technique is applied. Based on the research findings, it can be concluded that subsidy and developmental expenditures have a detrimental effect on environmental sustainability in the presence of positive shocks. Conversely, a negative shock in subsidies does not yield a significant impact, whereas a negative shock in development expenditures has a noteworthy and adverse influence on environmental sustainability. In the short run, the positive shock to both subsidy and developmental expenditures significantly affects environmental sustainability while the negative shock to developmental expenditure has an insignificant impact while subsidy has a significant effect on environmental sustainability. The study suggests that while making fiscal policies, the government should consider the environmental aspects of these measures. © 2024 United Nations.",About Sufficiency
The development of food logistics system to support food security and rice price stabilisation: A case study of Banten Province,"The disruption of the global rice trade caused by climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and geopolitical tensions has the potential to harm food security and the stability of domestic rice prices. The main weakness of the current logistics system lies in the accuracy of demand and supply data, as well as the poor condition of the logistics infrastructure, which limits the government's ability to take immediate action to reduce price fluctuations that occur over a very fast period. This study aims to analyse the existing condition of the rice logistics system in Banten Province by using quantitative descriptive analysis. The results of the study show the high intensity of domestic rice trade and inter-regional dependence; thus, it is important to initiate the improvement of the logistics system in Banten Province. However, data collector institutions found difficulties in obtaining and recording data along the chain. Therefore, it is recommended to a) improve the data monitoring instruments for rice demand and supply and the understanding of these improved instruments, b) increase production capacity, c) strengthen the regional ability to intervene in the market, d) develop infrastructure that supports smooth and efficient distribution, and e) establish inter-regional cooperation to enhance rice logistics systems. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2024.",About Sufficiency
"Socially responsible mining: The relationship between mining and poverty, human health and the environment","Increasing global demand for metals is putting strain on the ability of the mining industry to physically keep up with demand (physical scarcity). Conversely, social issues including the environmental and human health consequences of mining as well as the disparity in income distribution from mining revenues are disproportionately felt at the local community level. This has created social rifts, particularly in the developing world, between affected communities and both industry and governments. Such rifts can result in a disruption of the steady supply of metals (situational scarcity). Here we discuss the importance of mining in relationship to poverty, identify steps that have been taken to create a framework for socially responsible mining, and then discuss the need for academia to work in partnership with communities, government, and industry to develop transdisciplinary research-based step change solutions to the intertwined problems of physical and situational scarcity.",About Sufficiency

Is skewed income distribution good for environmental quality? A comparative analysis among selected BRICS countries,"A large number of studies have examined the linkage between income inequality and environmental quality at the individual country levels. This study attempts to examine the linkage between the two factors for the individual BRICS economies from a comparative perspective, which is scarce in the literature. It examines the selected countries (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) by endogenising the patterns of primary energy consumption (coal use and petroleum use), total primary energy consumption, economic growth, and urbanisation as key determining factors in CO2 emission function. The long-run results based on ARDL bounds testing revealed that income inequality leads to increase in CO2 emissions for Brazil, India and China, while the same factor leads to reduction in CO2 emissions for South Africa. However, it observes that while coal use increases CO2 emissions for India, China and South Africa, it has no effect for Brazil. In contrast, the use of petroleum products contributes to CO2 emissions in Brazil, while the use of the same surprisingly results in reduction of carbon emissions in South Africa, India and China. The findings suggest that given the significance of income inequality in environmental pollution, the policy makers in these emerging economies have to take into consideration the role of income inequality, while designing the energy policy to achieve environmental sustainability. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",About Sufficiency
Developing an Advanced IoT-Enabled Smart Agriculture Management System to Enhance Crop Growth: A Hybrid A-Residual-UNet Based Approach,"An increasing number of factors, including dwindling arable land, dwindling natural resources, and more intense and unpredictable weather events, have put food security at the forefront of international agendas. The agricultural industry is responding to these challenges by implementing ""smart agriculture""strategies that make use of big data and the IoT to increase operational efficiency and productivity. The three main components are feature selection, model training, and preprocessing. For the purpose of preprocessing, the proposed approach use zero unitarization and methods for normalizing diagnostic characteristics that are based on the Quotient Transform formula. Both IG and principal component analysis (PCA) are utilized in feature selection. IG outperforms PCA in terms of accuracy. To make the model training process more accurate, we employed the Hybrid-A-Residual-UNet. With an accuracy of 97.55%, the suggested method outperforms its competitors' methods, such as HDA and ResUNet. © 2024 IEEE.",About Sufficiency
Operationalizing marketable blue carbon,"The global carbon sequestration and avoided emissions potentially achieved via blue carbon is high (∼3% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions); however, it is limited by multidisciplinary and interacting uncertainties spanning the social, governance, financial, and technological dimensions. We compiled a transdisciplinary team of experts to elucidate these challenges and identify a way forward. Key actions to enhance blue carbon as a natural climate solution include improving policy and legal arrangements to ensure equitable sharing of benefits; improving stewardship by incorporating indigenous knowledge and values; clarifying property rights; improving financial approaches and accounting tools to incorporate co-benefits; developing technological solutions for measuring blue carbon sequestration at low cost; and resolving knowledge gaps regarding blue carbon cycles. Implementing these actions and operationalizing blue carbon will achieve measurable changes to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, provide multiple co-benefits, and address national obligations associated with international agreements. © 2022",About Sufficiency
"Uncertainty-Based Industrial Water Supply and Demand Balance Pattern Recognition: A Case Study in the Yellow River Basin of Gansu Province, China","The balance between water supply and demand is essential for industrial growth, affecting economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Our research employs a Gaussian process regression for demand prediction. Additionally, it takes into account water limits and policy thresholds when determining the supply, thereby defining a range of uncertainty for both the industrial demand and the supply. A pattern recognition method matches this trade-off range, identifying three patterns to support water management. The study focuses on the analysis of industrial water supply and demand dynamics under uncertain conditions in nine cities (Baiyin, Dingxi, Gannan, Lanzhou, Linxia, Pingliang, Qingyang, Tianshui, and Wuwei) in Gansu Province of China’s Yellow River Basin in 2030. The results of the study show that industrial water use in Baiyin, Linxia, Dingxi, and Tianshui cities falls into Pattern I, providing water resources to support industrial development. Industrial water use in Wuwei, Pingliang, Qingyang, and Gannan cities represents Pattern II, which maintains a balance between supply and demand while allowing flexibility in water demand. Finally, the industrial water use in Lanzhou city is characterized by Pattern III, which requires optimization through structural, technological, and management improvements to mitigate the negative impacts of water scarcity on the sustainable development of the economy and society. The results of the research can be used as a reference for policy making in water resources planning and management in the basin. © 2025 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
"To uncover economic losses and mitigation benefits of agricultural water scarcity by considering water availability, quality, and efficiency in China's largest dryland River Basin","Water scarcity constrains agricultural production and leads to significant economic losses. However, existing water scarcity risk (WSR) assessments often overlook the combined effects of water availability, quality, and efficiency, as well as potential mitigation benefits. This study develops an integrated assessment framework that incorporates these factors to evaluate agricultural WSR in the Yellow River Basin, a critical grain-producing region in China. The framework quantifies both direct economic losses in agriculture and indirect impacts on non-agricultural sectors through intercity trade, while also estimating mitigation benefits. Results show that insufficient water quality significantly amplifies economic losses, reaching 1189.9 billion CNY, compared to 391.0 billion CNY when only water quantity is considered. Key supply chain sectors, including food and tobacco processing, chemicals, and textiles, account for 56.6 % of total indirect agricultural WSR exports. Among mitigation measures, improving water quality and water-use efficiency reduces economic losses by 72.5 billion CNY and 53.2 billion CNY, respectively. Meanwhile, utilizing mine water in coal-rich regions and reclaimed water in urban centers can significantly reduce economic losses, with Ordos and Qingdao experiencing reductions of 75.4 % and 39.1 %, respectively. This framework provides a comprehensive approach to agricultural water management, integrating economic loss estimation with mitigation benefits to support sustainable water resource management. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",About Sufficiency
Addressing China's grand challenge of achieving food security while ensuring environmental sustainability,"China's increasingly urbanized and wealthy population is driving a growing and changing demand for food, which might not be met without significant increase in agricultural productivity and sustainable use of natural resources. Given the past relationship between lack of access to affordable food and political instability, food security has to be given a high priority on national political agendas in the context of globalization. The drive for increased food production has had a significant impact on the environment, and the deterioration in ecosystem quality due to historic and current levels of pollution will potentially compromise the food production system in China. We discuss the grand challenges of not only producing more food but also producing it sustainably and without environmental degradation. In addressing these challenges, food production should be considered as part of an environmental system (soil, air, water, and biodiversity) and not independent from it. It is imperative that new ways of meeting the demand for food are developed while safeguarding the natural resources upon which food production is based. We present a holistic approach to both science and policy to ensure future food security while embracing the ambition of achieving environmental sustainability in China. It is a unique opportunity for China to be a role model as a new global player, especially for other emerging economies. © 2015 The Authors.",About Sufficiency
A Scoping Review of Aquatic Food Systems during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented shock to capture fisheries and aquaculture sectors. This scoping review of 670 articles explored the spatial, temporal, and thematic coverage of this event. The search period was January 1, 2020 to February 7, 2022. Articles were mainly peer-reviewed journals (88%) with the remainder from the gray literature (12%). Studies were performed at the global (21%), multi-country (11%), national (45%), and sub-national (23%) levels. Most studies involved primary or secondary data collection (71%) and the remainder were either review articles (17%) or commentaries (12%). Among the studies using primary and secondary data, nearly half (49%) were performed in the first five months of the pandemic (March to July 2020), and 84% within the first year of the pandemic (March 2020–February 2021). There were many studies in South and Southeast Asia, Southern Europe, China, and the United States, and fewer studies in other regions. The pandemic created challenges and opportunities, with heterogeneity in impacts among industrial and small-scale sectors, production methods, geographies, value chains, and by gender. Cumulative impacts from climate change and conflicts contributed to pandemic-related hardships. Increased unemployment and inflation led to rising food insecurity for small-scale producers, fishworkers, and low-income households. Aquatic food intake was more severely affected than other food groups during lockdowns, and it decreased more in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Responses were diverse, reflecting the capacity and resources of a country, but in general there was unprecedented public support to sustain the private sector (i.e., income support, tax relief, subsidies). As this study focused mainly on the first year of the pandemic, future work is needed to identify which groups exited the pandemic stronger or weaker, what factors enabled some populations to bounce-back, how the crisis affected value chains, and the effectiveness of interventions. © 2023 Food & Agricultural Organization.

Evaluating the sustainability of complex socio-environmental systems. The MESMIS framework,"Sustainable development has become a leading target of scientific research and policy agenda. In the context of natural resource management, understanding and evaluating the performance of complex socio-environmental systems has become a challenge, and the design of more sustainable alternatives is a driving need. In addition, there is a need to translate the general principles of sustainability into operational definitions and practices. This paper examines key methodological issues in the selection, transformation and aggregation of economic, environmental and social indicators for sustainability analysis. Specific reference is given to the MESMIS approach, a systemic, participatory, interdisciplinary and flexible framework for sustainability evaluation. The MESMIS framework has been developed by a multi-institutional team in Mexico and validated through its application to more than 20 case studies in Mexico and Latin America. The MESMIS operative structure is a six step cycle. The first three steps are devoted to the characterisation of the systems, the identification of critical points and the selection of specific indicators for the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability. In the last three steps, the information obtained by means of the indicators is integrated through mixed (qualitative and quantitative) techniques and multicriteria analysis, so as to obtain a value judgement about the resource management systems and to provide suggestions and insights aimed at improving their socio-environmental profile. MESMIS attempts to generate a cyclic process which, by effectively integrating the evaluation into the decision making process, improves the likelihood of success in the design of alternatives and the implementation of development projects. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A nexus of income inequality and natural resource utilization efficiency: Effect on the road to green economic recovery,"While China possesses abundant natural resources, their utilization efficiency remains low. As economic and social development progress rapidly, promoting natural resource utilization efficiency is crucial for the construction of the country's ecological capacity. However, research investigating the effect of income inequality on natural resource utilization efficiency is insufficient. Using the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2019, this paper analyzes the impact of income inequality on natural resource utilization efficiency. The empirical results denote that income inequality has a significantly negative impact on natural resource utilization efficiency and presents a discernible influence on lower green innovation ability and natural resource endowment. In addition, green fiscal policy and industrial agglomeration can alleviate the negative impact of income inequality on natural resource utilization efficiency. Furthermore, the threshold effect reveals that, with technological progress, the negative impact of income inequality on natural resource utilization efficiency has transformed into a positive. © 2023",About Sufficiency
Effects of tillage and straw management on grain yield and SOC storage in a wheat-maize cropping system,"Climate change significantly impacts the prevailing climatic conditions and crop productivity. Although soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration can mitigate global climate change, the SOC sequestration capacity and crop production under conservation tillage are unclear. This study assessed the dynamics and relationship between SOC storage and grain yield under conservation tillage over eight years. Four tillage and straw management treatments, including (i) no-tillage with straw retention (NTS, conservation tillage), (ii) conventional tillage with straw retention (CTS), (iii) no-tillage without straw retention (NT), and (iv) conventional tillage without straw retention (CT), were conducted. The results showed that the SOC content and storage in the 0–10 cm soil layer were significantly higher in NTS than in the other treatments. In contrast, SOC content and storage in the 10–30 cm layer were lower in NTS than in CTS (P < 0.05). Overall, the average SOC storage in the 0–30 cm was significantly higher in the straw returning treatment than without straw returning (P < 0.05). Moreover, SOC storage was not significantly different between NTS (35.7 Mg ha−1) and CTS (35.9 Mg ha−1). The wheat yield was lowest under NTS. Furthermore, the yield coefficient of variation under NTS was significantly lower than under CTS (P < 0.05). Maize yield was not significantly different between NTS and CTS. SOC storage in the 0–10 cm soil layer had a quadratic relationship with annual yield. These results indicate that NTS can positively sequester carbon, especially for the surface layer. However, to mitigate climate change and food insecurity, further advancements in NTS technology are required to improve crop yields and carbon sequestration capacity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
"Assessing the role of energy finance, green policies, and investment towards green economic recovery","Settling a “green recovery” at the center of all economic recuperation procedures is progressively seen as the finest and as the only way nations could restore their economies. Therefore, this study assesses the role of energy finance, green policies, and investment towards green economic recovery in the USA by using a linear econometric approach and nonlinear (DSGE) model. Considering the fiscal tax-lowering rate, for instance, the study evaluates the effects of fiscal measures on local fiscal pressures in the USA regarding the pandemic. The regression analysis shows that both energy finance and green energy policies have positive and statistically significant impacts on green investment. The results from the linear econometric approach indicate that every additional state green energy policy tool adopted is associated with 1% more green investment in the USA. In addition, the findings show that green policies in human resources and R&D of green energy technologies prompt a sustainable green economy through labor and technology-oriented production activities. Implications for scholars, investors, technology managers, and policymakers are derived and discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",About Sufficiency
Sweet spots are in the food system: Structural adjustments to co-control regional pollutants and national GHG emissions in China,"The Chinese government aims to mitigate climate change while also reducing local air pollution; this requires co-control of greenhouse gases and pollutants. Here, we develop a method combining an elasticity analysis and a multi-regional input–output model, to measure changes in the emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants and corresponding socio-economic costs caused by the adjustments in intermediate input, inter-regional trade, and final demand transactions for 30 provinces in China. A filter framework is proposed to identify the key structural transactions that can significantly co-control both emission types with small socio-economic impacts. The results show that 13 effective co-control spots can simultaneously reduce greenhouse gases and pollutants. Among these, eight co-controls are associated with low economic costs, which we refer to as ‘sweet spots’. Sweet spots cover agricultural inputs in the food and tobacco sectors of Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Liaoning, and Hubei; self-inputs in the agriculture of Henan; self-inputs in the food and tobacco sector of Shandong; fixed capital formation of agriculture in Hebei; and urban household consumption of agricultural products in Guangdong. This finding is important, as climate measures mostly side-line the agricultural sector so far, both in China and in other parts of the world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Introducing a conceptual model for wellbeing tourism–going beyond the triple bottom line of sustainability,"The need to re-envision alternative paradigms in tourism is becoming evident with the increasingly experienced climate change and degradation of life supporting ecosystem services, to which the tourism industry has a significant adverse contribution. Could tourism be re-envisioned to bring positive effects on social, environmental and individual wellbeing? In this paper, we present the outcome of an extensive literature review and a cross-border post card workshop with researchers and tourism officials. Drawing on this, a conceptual framework of a comprehensive, relational idea of wellbeing tourism is proposed, that extends beyond our current notion of sustainability and the widely used and accepted triple bottom line model (TBL). The suggested model proposes a shift from focusing on sustainability alone, to giving increased attention and value to integral health and to life quality. The paper highlights that wellbeing tourism can only truly be reached when all its suggested six pillars are fulfilled in a relative balance among the community related external ones (environment, economy, social; “sustainability”) and those that may be experienced as individual (body, mind, soul). The importance of wellbeing tourism supporting a society with the governing characteristics of happiness, harmony, and abundance, building collaborative and regenerative systems are emphasised. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",About Sufficiency
An alternative water-fertilizer-saving management practice for wheat-maize cropping system in the North China Plain: Based on a 4-year field study,"Developing an alternative water-fertilizer-saving management practice for winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system in the North China Plain (NCP) is urgent to address severe water scarcity and adverse environmental impacts. A four-year field experiment in split plot design was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplemental drip irrigation on grain yield, water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), nitrogen (N) loss and economic benefits, keeping three supplemental drip irrigation times (DI0, no irrigation after emergence; DI3, irrigation once at wheat jointing, once at maize seedling and once at maize jointing; DI5, irrigation once at wheat jointing, once at wheat anthesis, once at maize seedling, once at maize jointing and once at maize tasseling) in the main plots and three N fertilizer rates (N0, no N fertilizer; N60%, 60% of the local recommended N fertilizer rate, 272 kg N ha−1 yr−1; N100%, 100% of the local recommended N fertilizer rate, 453 kg N ha−1 yr−1) in the sub plots. The traditional surface irrigation regime was also conducted as control (CK) under local recommended N fertilizer at 453 kg N ha−1 yr−1. The results showed that DI5N60% achieved the highest WUE in wheat (1.93 kg m−3) and maize (3.00 kg m−3) on average, which was 3.0% and 25.3% higher compared to CK, respectively. The highest partial factor productivity from applied N (PEPN) in wheat and maize were also observed in DI5N60% (56.8 kg kg−1 and 56.3 kg kg−1, respectively) on average, which was 54.0% and 74.0% higher compared to CK, respectively. For winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system, DI5N60% can generally achieve similar crop yield and net income but reduce irrigation and N fertilizer use and N loss compared to CK. Therefore, DI5N60% was considered as an alternative water-fertilizer-saving management practice for winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system in the NCP. Moreover, the optimized combination of irrigation amount and N fertilizer rate corresponding simultaneously to higher crop yield, WUE and net income were determined by using the response surface methodology based on binary quadratic regression analysis, and the optimal irrigation amount were 165 mm and 90 mm, optimal N rates were 186 kg N ha−1 and 185 kg N ha−1 for winter wheat and summer maize, respectively. © 2022 The Authors",About Sufficiency
European transitions towards a corporate-environmental food regime: Agroecological incorporation or contestation?,"The 'food regime' concept helps to analyse potential transitions beyond the agro-industrial regime which has been globally dominant since the 1970s. As its multiple crises generate alternative production methods and products, some have been incorporated into a nascent 'corporate-environmental food regime'. This nascent regime is illustrated here by two agendas prominent in Europe - 'bioeconomy' (Life Sciences) and 'sustainable intensification' (neoproductivism). As a significant difference, the prevalent 'bioeconomy' agenda marginalises agroecological practices, while 'sustainable intensification' selectively incorporates such practices within a broader toolkit including biotech. Regardless of that difference, both agendas reinforce a neoliberal productivist narrative: namely, more resource-efficient methods are necessary for increasing production to fulfill the greater market demand for food, feed, fuel, etc. In this way, the capital-accumulation driver is reified as 'market demand' arising exogenously from the food production system - which thereby accommodates societal needs. By contrast, the agroecology narrative diagnoses the problem as profit-driven agro-industrial monoculture systems making farmers dependent on external inputs, undermining their knowledge, and distancing consumers from agri-producers. Through such a narrative, new alliances have elaborated a different future linking farmers' knowledge-exchange, agroecology, food sovereignty, citizens' initiatives, public knowledge about food production, etc. Civil society organisations have facilitated such linkages among researchers, scientists and social movements. In those ways, contending narratives justify different trajectories for an agro-food transition. Each links different innovation paradigms of technique, quality and knowledge. These differences often remain implicit amidst broad terms such as bioeconomy, sustainable intensification, agroecology, etc. Making the divergences explicit can help contest transitions towards a corporate-environmental food regime, while also counterposing agroecological alternatives. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Health Promotion Practices and the Sustainable Global Economy,"For the post-COVID-19 pandemic period, along with the ageing population and the increasing awareness of universal healthcare, the development of health services has been becoming increasingly important over the past decade. Substantial investment has been made in the capital market for health-related products, applying advanced technologies in healthcare facilities and investing human capital into health industries. These are important elements to build resilient infrastructure in the healthcare sector that contributes to the local economy for the sustainability of cities or communities. Resilient infrastructure refers to the ability and capacity of physical systems, such as buildings, utilities, and transportation networks, to withstand shocks or disruptions caused by natural disasters (e.g. earthquakes), climate change events (e.g. floods), or outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining essential functions and services for local communities. Hence, a long-term strategy for health promotion should integrate the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as a foundation, which provides an international guideline and standard for health promotion practices, in order to establish a balance of economic development and financial sustainability of health services. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to reflection for health services to build resilient infrastructure to increase the efficiency of health service management by green or clean energy to support healthcare infrastructure (SDG 7), innovative medical devices (SDG 9), and sustainable healthcare production and consumption with green supply chain management (SDG 12). However, this approach requires strategic partnership (SDG 17) in the health sector, particularly public-private partnerships (PPPs), between public-sector companies and social service organisations, or between private companies and healthcare research institutions, to explore innovative ways to address the issues. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Ben Y.

"GMO risks, food security, climate change and the entrenchment of neo-liberal legal narratives","This article explores the artificial nature of the neo-liberal legal narratives on GMOs, complementing Anne Saab’s analysis of the Public International Law (‘PIL’) climate change adaptation regime with a deconstruction of the hegemonic transnational legal discourse on the risks, costs and benefits of agricultural biotechnologies. The enquiry into the dominant regulatory approach to the governance of GMO risks sheds light on its specific political and socio-economic implications, lending support to the argument that GMOs are identified as a strategy to tackle food insecurity and facilitate climate change adaptation simply because their development, patenting and trade serve the profit-making goals of transnational market actors. Against this backdrop, the PIL discourse on climate resilient GMOs and the hegemonic transnational legal narrative on GMO safety and food security turn out to be two sides of the same coin. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",About Sufficiency
Development towards low carbon and sustainable agriculture in Finland is possible with moderate changes in land use and diets,"Food security under climate change, several sustainability problems, and ambitious climate targets are considered challenges for agriculture and food sectors in many countries. Since agricultural production and its land use produce appr. 20% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Finland, reducing agricultural GHG emissions is important for meeting national target of climate neutrality by 2035. Healthier food diets, maintenance of biodiversity, and reduced nutrient leaching from agriculture are also required for a more sustainable food economy. This paper aims to show how agriculture in Finland, traditionally dominated by livestock production, could decrease GHG emissions significantly and simultaneously respond to other sustainability concerns. Our results, based on economic modelling of the agricultural sector, suggest that moderate changes in food diets and land use can reduce GHG emissions of agriculture by more than 40% by 2050 if productivity growth and policy changes support the overall change in the agriculture and food sector. Adaptation to climate change, e.g. more higher crop yields efficient input use, is necessary for productivity growth. Decreased demand for meat and decreased cultivation of feed crops would decrease GHG emissions and free up land for carbon sequestration through afforestation. Whilst healthier food diets imply less livestock and increased imports of protein crops for food, a reasonable volume of livestock production is useful for maintaining food security, grasslands, crop rotations, soil carbon, and biodiversity. We conclude that transition to low carbon and more sustainable agriculture is possible without risking food security at northern latitudes. © 2022, The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
The adoption of conservation agriculture by smallholder farmers in southern Africa: A scoping review of barriers and enablers,"The Anthropocene has brought with it many challenges, the primary of which are climate change and food security. The growing global population increasingly demands more from a shrinking resource base, while variable climate conditions make future provision uncertain. To address issues of low agricultural productivity and land degradation, conservation agriculture (CA) has been promoted in smallholder settings across Africa. CA is an agricultural package that consists of three key principles (minimum soil disturbance, mulching, and crop rotation) and its success depends on the simultaneous implementation of all three principles. However, CA has met with limited success. A scoping review was conducted to assess the barriers and enablers of CA for smallholder farmers in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) – a regional inter-governmental economic community. The scoping review included peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, reviews, and grey literature written in English that focused on the contextual links between CA adoption and the smallholder context, since 2015. Six electronic databases were consulted, and included records were charted according to a pre-defined data extraction form. A total of 66 records were included. A qualitative content analysis was performed. The findings indicated four central themes – physical resources, human resources, informational resources, and financial resources. The four central themes and their respective categories, detailing barriers and enablers, were combined to produce the Conservation Agriculture Suitability Framework for Smallholder Farmers. The review contributes to the knowledge base of the CA discipline and practice by revealing the contextual determinants of successful CA implementation. Ultimately, the success of CA in southern Africa will be underpinned by how well it fits into the broader smallholder farming system. © 2022",About Sufficiency
Analysis of industrial water–energy–labor nexus zones for economic and resource-based impact assessment,"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the blueprints for achieving a sustainable future, and understanding the interlinkages among social, economic, and environmental fields is a key factor in accomplishing them. The goal of this study was to analyze a framework for sustainable economic growth considering the trade-offs among economic inequality, resource security, and labor requirement through an industrial water, energy, and labor (I-WEL) nexus approach. We analyzed the economic intensity of industrial water, energy, and labor in 47 prefectures in Japan; we found that the more industrialized prefectures showed lower water but higher energy intensities than relatively less industrialized prefectures. We then classified four I-WEL nexus zones—high efficiency, labor-intensive, water-intensive, and water- and energy-intensive zones—based on their economic intensities and by using the K-means clustering method. Finally, we applied economic growth scenarios, weighted by I-WEL nexus zones, and quantified water, energy, and labor requirements by scenario at the local, regional, and national scales. The results show that, by using weighted economic growth in the high-efficiency I-WEL nexus zones and relative to the baseline scenario (which assigns equal ratios of increased economic growth to all prefectures), a potential savings of 337 Mm³/year of freshwater and 184 PJ/year of energy can be realized. However, as the more industrially developed prefectures were included in the high-efficiency zone, this scenario increased the Gini coefficient, i.e., the economic inequality among prefectures. In summary, this study shows that the application of the I-WEL nexus can be used as a framework for sustainable economic growth considering the trade-offs between efficiency of resource use and economic inequality. © 2021",About Sufficiency
Energy Transition in Latin America: Historic Perspective and Challenges in Achieving Sustainable Development Goals,"In Latin America, the energy transition has been characterized by a shift from oil to gas as a fuel for electricity generation, as well as a significant presence of hydroelectric power and increasing diversification of renewable energy sources with the participation of biomass, solar, and wind. There is scarce participation of coal in the energy mix compared to the other regions of the world. Energy transitions in Latin America are a more complex process that refers not only to changing the energy system but also to ensuring that the transition benefits all people, including the vulnerable population. This requires addressing issues related to affordability, accessibility, and sustainability of energy production and supply. Moreover, the region faces several challenges such as low long-term economic growth, high dependence on oil revenues and raw materials in its export structure, the establishment of sacrifice zones that this dependence causes on local communities, social inequality, and limited access to public goods. By considering the interplay between the various factors, challenges, and opportunities, policymakers and stakeholders can develop more effective strategies for achieving sustainable energy transitions in the region. This book offers a thorough and insightful analysis of the challenges and opportunities related to transitioning to sustainable energy systems in Latin America. It gives insights into oil-dependent countries' problems and the urgency of tackling climate change. The diverse topics covered in the book, including geopolitics, energy trilemma, energy access, poverty, decentralization, and democratization, present a multidimensional perspective. Overall, this book provides a valuable resource for anyone seeking to understand the complex challenges and opportunities in transitioning to sustainable energy systems in Latin America. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",About Sufficiency

Procurement of logistics services and sustainable development in Europe: Fields of activity and empirical results,"This paper strives to answer the general question; how far purchasers of logistics services take into account aspects of sustainable development. Modeled on the German Sustainable Development Strategy, which is based on the EU Sustainable Development plan, five fields of activity are defined: the reduction of transport intensity and emission, the reduction of land use, the choice of carrier under consideration of sustainable aspects, the permanent improvement of working conditions, and the enhancement of qualified employment. Then, propositions for purchasing companies of logistics services are developed, which contribute to safeguard ecological as well as social sustainability. In order to conduct an explorative study, a questionnaire was sent to 750 purchase and logistics managers. It was found that purchasing companies place high value on ecological and social aspects. But the perceived importance is not associated with purchasing companies' own contributions to logistics service providers' sustainable activities. Additionally, it was seen that purchasing companies exert only a minor influence on logistics service providers regarding ecologically and socially sustainable actions. A fundamental precondition for a sustainably oriented procurement of logistics services can be seen in the purchasing companies' awareness of the need for integrating sustainable aspects in economic decisions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",About Sufficiency
A compact to revitalise large-scale irrigation systems using a leadership-partnership-ownership 'Theory of change',"In countries with transitional economies such as those found in South Asia, large-scale irrigation systems (LSIS) with a history of public ownership account for about 115 million ha (Mha) or approximately 45% of their total area under irrigation. In terms of the global area of irrigation (320 Mha) for all countries, LSIS are estimated at 130 Mha or 40% of irrigated land. These systems can potentially deliver significant local, regional and global benefits in terms of food, water and energy security, employment, economic growth and ecosystem services. For example, primary crop production is conservatively valued at about US$355 billion. However, efforts to enhance these benefits and reform the sector have been costly and outcomes have been underwhelming and short-lived. We propose the application of a 'theory of change' (ToC) as a foundation for promoting transformational change in large-scale irrigation centred upon a 'global irrigation compact' that promotes new forms of leadership, partnership and ownership (LPO). The compact argues that LSIS can change by switching away from the current channelling of aid finances controlled by government irrigation agencies. Instead it is for irrigators, closely partnered by private, public and NGO advisory and regulatory services, to develop strong leadership models and to find new compensatory partnerships with cities and other river basin neighbours. The paper summarises key assumptions for change in the LSIS sector including the need to initially test this change via a handful of volunteer systems. Our other key purpose is to demonstrate a ToC template by which large-scale irrigation policy can be better elaborated and discussed.",About Sufficiency
Climate change adaptation and the role of fuel subsidies: An empirical bio-economic modeling study for an artisanal open-access fishery,"Climate change can severely impact artisanal fisheries and affect the role they play in food security. We study climate change effects on the triple bottom line of ecological productivity, fishers’ incomes, and fish consumption for an artisanal open-access fishery. We develop and apply an empirical, stochastic bio-economic model for the Senegalese artisanal purse seine fishery on small pelagic fish and compare the simulated fishery’s development using four climate projections and two policy scenarios. We find that economic processes of adaptation may amplify the effects of climate variations. The regions’ catch potential increases with climate change, induced by stock distribution changes. However, this outcome escalates over-fishing, whose effects outpace the incipiently favorable climate change effects under three of the four climate projections. Without policy action, the fishery is estimated to collapse in 2030–2035 on average over 1000 runs.

Of fish and fishermen: Shifting societal baselines to reduce environmental harm in fisheries,"If reasonable fishery harvests and environmental harms are specified in new regulations, policies, and laws governing the exploitation of fish for food and livelihoods, then societal baselines can shift to achieve sustainable fisheries and marine conservation. Fisheries regulations can limit the environmental and social costs or harms caused by fishing by requiring the fishing industry to pay for the privilege to fish, via access fees for the opportunity to catch fish and extraction fees for fish caught; both fees can be combined with a progressive environmental tax to discourage overcapitalization and overfishing. Fisheries policies can be sustainable if predicated on an instrumental and ethical harm principle to reduce fishing harm. To protect the public trust in fisheries, environmental laws can identify the unsustainable depletion of fishery resources as ecological damage and a public nuisance to bind private fishing enterprises to a harm principle. Collaborative governance can foster sustainable fisheries if decision-making rights and responsibilities of marine stewardship are shared among government, the fishing industry, and civil society. As global food security and human welfare are threatened by accelerating human population growth and environmental impacts, decisions of how to use and protect the environment will involve collective choices in which all citizens have a stake - and a right. © 2012 by the author(s).",About Sufficiency
Managing soils for resolving the conflict between agriculture and nature: The hard talk,"Among soil-centric options for addressing global issues being intensely debated by soil scientists, ecologists and earth scientists regarding their effectiveness and applicability are: (a) harnessing soil carbon (C) sink capacity for adaptation and mitigation of climate change; (b) reducing soil erosion as a source of greenhouse gases and the need to include it in the global C budget; (c) enhancing use efficiency of inputs to agroecosystems and returning land, water and other resources back to nature; (d) using global drylands, saline culture, halomorphic plants and brackish water for provisioning of ecosystem services; and (e) adopting a system-based conservation agriculture for eco-intensification of agroecosystems as a strategy of “producing more from less”. Not only should agriculture be made a solution for addressing global issues, but it is also essential to reconciling the need for advancing food and nutritional security with the absolute necessity of enhancing the environment, restoring degraded soils and desertified ecosystems, and advancing Sustainable Development Goals or the Agenda 2030. Highlights: Sustainable soil management, degraded soil restoration abridging agronomic yield gap and improving the environment are important to achieve world peace. Sustainable eco-intensification of agro-ecosystems reduces inputs and enhances use efficiency by restoring soil health. Harnessing soil carbon sink capacity includes reducing accelerated soil erosion for adaptation and mitigation of climate change.

Soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change and advance food security,"World soils have been a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide since the dawn of settled agriculture, which began about 10 millennia ago. Most agricultural soils have lost 30% to 75% of their antecedent soil organic carbon (SOC) pool or 30 to 40 t C ha. The magnitude of loss is often more in soils prone to accelerated erosion and other degradative processes. On a global scale, CO2-C emissions since 1850 are estimated at 270 ± 30 giga ton (billion ton or Gt) from fossil fuel combustion compared with 78 ± 12 Gt from soils. Consequently, the SOC pool in agricultural soils is much lower than their potential capacity. Furthermore, depletion of the SOC pool also leads to degradation in soil quality and declining agronomic/biomass productivity. Therefore, conversion to restorative land uses (e.g., afforestation, improved pastures) and adoption of recommended management practices (RMP) can enhance SOC and improve soil quality. Important RMP for enhancing SOC include conservation tillage, mulch farming, cover crops, integrated nutrient management including use of manure and compost, and agroforestry. Restoration of degraded/desertified soils and ecosystems is an important strategy. The rate of SOC sequestration, ranging from 100 to 1000 kg ha year, depends on climate, soil type, and site-specific management. Total potential of SOC sequestration in the United States of 144 to 432 Mt year (288 Mt year) comprises 45 to 98 Mt in cropland, 13 to 70 Mt in grazing land, and 25 to 102 Mt in forestland. The global potential of SOC sequestration is estimated at 0.6 to 1.2 Gt C year, comprising 0.4 to 0.8 Gt C year through adoption of RMP on cropland (1350 Mha), and 0.01 to 0.03 Gt C year on irrigated soils (275 Mha), and 0.01 to 0.3 Gt C year through improvements of rangelands and grasslands (3700 Mha). In addition, there is a large potential of C sequestration in biomass in forest plantations, short rotation woody perennials, and so on. The attendant improvement in soil quality with increase in SOC pool size has a strong positive impact on agronomic productivity and world food security. An increase in the SOC pool within the root zone by 1 t C ha year can enhance food production in developing countries by 30 to 50 Mt year including 24 to 40 Mt year of cereal and legumes, and 6 to 10 Mt year of roots and tubers. Despite the enormous challenge of SOC sequestration, especially in regions of warm and arid climates and predominantly resource-poor farmers, it is a truly a win-win strategy. While improving ecosystem services and ensuring sustainable use of soil resources, SOC sequestration also mitigates global warming by offsetting fossil fuel emissions and improving water quality by reducing nonpoint source pollution. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",About Sufficiency
"INTEGRATED USE OF CORK OAK FORESTS: CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION, PRODUCT DIVERSIFICATION AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS","The BIOBOR project: Bornizo for the Bio-economy, proposes a multidisciplinary approach to promote cork production in cork oak groves planted during the period 1993-2000, thanks to the subsidies granted by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), within the afforestation programs promoted by the European Economic Community (EEC) directive 2080/92. In many of these cork oak groves planted in Spain, no forestry action has been carried out since then and this lack of management could lead to the abandonment of the cork oak groves. Therefore, promoting cork production in these young cork oak groves will help to prevent their abandonment and will stimulate economic, environmental and social activity in these areas. The project has developed guidelines for good practices in forest management, analyzed new uses of bornizo in more renewable and ecological technological applications and evaluated the sustainability of these woodlands. Ultimately, the main aim of the project is the promotion of cork production in juvenile cork oak forests by developing tools that facilitate production startup in youth cork oak stands and considering the environmental impacts throughout the process. © 2023 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.",About Sufficiency
Green Transitions: Rethinking Political Economy in the Context of Climate Change,"Although political economy (PE) has long engaged with environmental issues, climate change has remained at the margins of the field until very recently. This article argues that fully addressing the transformative challenges brought up by climate change requires a fundamental rethinking of core PE concepts related to the state, distributional struggles, economic growth, varieties of capitalism, and markets. Rather than treating the state as a neutral regulator or market facilitator, we conceptualize the green state as actively structuring transitions through mitigation policies, adaptation strategies, and the governance of just transition conflicts. Green transitions generate new distributional conflicts—within and across countries, between incumbent and emerging industries, and among social groups with unequal exposure to climate risks and transition costs. Climate policy also challenges growth-centered economic models, raising questions about the viability of green growth versus degrowth strategies. Different varieties of capitalism are evolving in response, with distinct institutional pathways shaping the speed and character of transition efforts. Finally, we critique market-based approaches that assume price mechanisms alone can drive decarbonization, highlighting the role of non-economic values, institutional constraints, and distributional struggles in shaping green markets. By linking climate change to core debates in comparative and international political economy, we identify new research agendas for understanding the uneven and contested pathways of green transitions across economic systems. This article, along with the others in this special issue on Greening the Economy: Toward a New Political Economy, aims to bridge some of these critical gaps. © 2025 The Author(s).

Innovative technologies and problems of ecological Agriculture of Russia,"The modern history of organic farming in Russia began in 1989 with the implementation of the state program ""Alternative Agriculture"". Organic agriculture in Russia was initially considered as a condition and mechanism for the development of small and medium agricultural forms of production. The increase in the production of agricultural products and food in excess of the normative requirements, ensuring the country's food security led to the expansion of exports. Russia's aptitude to uphold fulfillment with global standards and be competitive in world markets where ecologically clean agricultural products are in demand is quite high: huge reserves of land in Russia, the introduction of ecological farming systems must be carried out on huge areas, coordinated with a large number of small owners. Information support for farmers about new, more efficient technical means, biotechnologies in organic agriculture and certification of organic products for environmental friend-liness, safety of manufactured products, the use of intensive biotechnologies, financial support of organic agriculture, processing and sale of organic products remain problematic. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Diversified cropping systems for reducing soil erosion and nutrient loss and for increasing crop productivity and profitability in rainfed environments,"CONTEXT: Globally, rainfed regions encounter several constraints that limit crop production. Poor and degraded soils resulting from soil erosion are one among them. We hypothesized that a diversified cropping system in rainfed drylands can reduce soil erosion and improve soil health and crop productivity and meet the food security needs of rainfed farmers. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess potential diversified cropping systems in terms of reducing soil erosion and water and nutrient losses, and increasing crop and systems productivity and profitability. METHODS: The study was carried out at the Gungal Research Farm of ICAR Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (17o05’ N, 78o39’E) from 2015 to 16 to 2020–21. The study investigated seven diversified cropping systems (treatments): sorghum + pigeon pea- hedge lucerne, sorghum + pigeonpea- guinea grass, castor- hedge lucerne, castor- guinea grass, sorghum- fodder clusterbean- fodder cowpea- fodder horsegram, sole sorghum, and sole pigeonpea. Multi-criteria assessments were conducted to understand trade-offs related to soil nutrients and their losses, and productivity and profitability of various annual and perennial based systems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the various systems evaluated, sole sorghum was the most sensitive to soil erosion, leading to highest amount of nutrient loss in all years (87.5, 47.3, and 9.8 kg N, P and K ha−1 in 2019–20, 102.4, 58.2, 14.2 kg N, P and K ha−1 in 2020–21, and 78.6, 39.2, 6.16 kg N, P and K ha−1 in 2021–22). The perennial based cropping systems with more diverse crops and greater land cover that included sorghum + pigeonpea - guinea grass and sorghum + pigeon pea - hedge lucerne had the lowest amount of nutrient loss. The least cumulative monetary value of nutrient loss was in sorghum + pigeon pea - hedge lucerne (137.11 US$) followed by sorghum + pigeonpea - guinea grass (145.33 US$). The systems with diverse crops reduced runoff and soil erosion, improved soil health, and increased crop and systems productivity and profitability. The trade-offs analysis using the radar graphs also showed lower soil loss and improved soil heath in diversified perennial based cropping systems, resulting in increase in net income to US$1981 for sorghum + pigeonpea - hedge lucerne compared to US$909 for sole sorghum. SIGNIFICANCE: Perennial based cropping systems with diverse crops can be an effective strategy to reduce soil erosion and improve soil health, and increase crop and systems productivity in rainfed areas of south India. These results have implications to other countries globally with rainfed climate and dryland farming. © 2023",About Sufficiency
Driving factors for responsible sourcing in Europe: Motivations of renewable energy technology manufacturers,"The paper highlights the urgent demand for sustainable energy transitions within planetary boundaries while addressing social injustices. This transformation significantly relies on increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources, which requires extensive mining and utilisation of energy transition metals like copper, cobalt, and lithium. Particular concerns arise when Indigenous lands are involved in mining operations, raising issues of human rights and environmental integrity. The European Union and the United States of America have responded to these concerns with legislative measures to enhance supply chain transparency and prevent conflicts stemming from unethical practices. The study aims to explore responsible sourcing efforts among renewable energy technology manufacturers operating in Europe in the context of these regulations and the obstacles they encounter. Through semi-structured interviews with sustainability and procurement managers, the research investigates internal and external drivers for responsible sourcing, identifying altruistic values and regulatory compliance as critical factors. Despite acknowledging the importance of responsible sourcing, supply chain complexity and resource limitations persist. Ultimately, the study suggests that while responsible sourcing initiatives have the potential to promote justice within supply chains, there is a pressing need for holistic approaches to overcome existing barriers and effectively implement sustainable practices across the renewable energy sector. © 2025 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency
The Influence of the World Grain Market on Prevalence of Mankind’s Undernourishment in the Times of War on the Ukraine,"The world cereal production and supply as well as their trade, stock and losses are important indicators of the world market of cereals. They play a huge role in ensuring food security. The aim of this research is to identify the relation of the indicators of the world grain crops market (production, supply, losses, trade, stocks) and the level of malnutrition Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) among the world's population. Based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), a correlation-regression analysis was conducted between indicators of the global grain crops market, in particular: the wheat market, the fodder market of grain crops, the rice market and PoU of the world population for the period 2013/14 - 2020/2021 marketing years. It has been proven that there is a close, statistically reliable relationship between the above mentioned indicators, except for grain stocks and POU. The analysis of the world cereal market showed that among the indicators characterizing its conditions, the indicator trade in grain crops (r = 0.851; D = 0.724; F = 3.968, (F > Ft); z = 1.26; rL = 0.37; rU = 0.97) has the highest level of correlation. It was found that with an increase in the volume of world cereal trade by 1 million tons, the PoU level will increase by 0.018%. A review of literary sources proves that the problem of ensuring food security, in particular with regard to reducing the level of starvation and malnutrition, cannot be solved only by fighting climate change, overcoming socio-economic and military problems, fighting pandemics, etc. Its solution to a large extent depends on fair, uniform export and import of food products, as evidenced by the calculations. A separate direction for solving the problem of the spread of malnutrition is the elimination of the policy of highly developed countries regarding the application of individual sanctions against countries with high PoU values, in particular, the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Haiti, Afghanistan, Chad, Congo, Lesotho, Liberia, Mozambique, etc. © 2024, Politechnika Lubelska.

What role can a livelihood strategy play in addressing climate change? Lessons in improving social capital from an agricultural cooperative in Ukraine,"Increasing support to small-holder farmers plays an important part in meeting the climate and development challenges of agriculture: realizing global food security under increasing climate variability, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and conserving natural resources. Cooperatives offer a well-established livelihood strategy and means to support small-holders. This case study examined a Ukrainian cooperative using the sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) to understand the role cooperatives play in addressing climate change, and the process by which capacity is used to adapt and/or mitigate climate change. Climate change does not prompt cooperative formation and climate change mitigation might not be a planned outcome in a livelihood strategy. However, modifying the SLF to include climate change outcomes provides a means of understanding the process by which building capacity results in mitigation and adaptation. Cooperative members and stakeholders outside of the cooperative participated in semi-structure interviews. Social capital emerged as a theme with interviewees from all backgrounds. Initially closed networks and distrust prevented members from joining the cooperative. As the cooperative built new networks, the benefit of joining became apparent to members. Information gained through networks improved access to other capitals, improved livelihood outcomes and addressed climate change. Social capital fulfils key roles in the process of capacity building and implementation of sustainable measures; thus improving social capital could arguably be the chief benefit of cooperatives. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",About Sufficiency
The water footprint of staple crop trade under climate and policy scenarios,"Trade in staple crop commodities has become increasingly important in the global food system, with ramifications for both food security and water resources sustainability. It is thus essential to understand how the water footprint (WF) of staple crop trade may change in the future. To this end, we project international staple crop trade and its WF under climate and policy scenarios for the year 2030. We use the H08 global hydrologic model to determine the impact of climatic changes to staple crop yields and evapotranspiration. Using the yield changes projected with the H08 model, we estimate the bilateral trade of staple crops using the Global Trade Analysis Project model. We combine these projections to obtain the total and blue WF of agricultural trade and global water savings (GWS) across scenarios. This approach enables us to determine the direct impact of climate change and trade liberalization - together and in isolation - on the WF of staple crop trade. Importantly, we show that trade liberalization leads to greater WF, making it a potentially important adaptation measure to a changing climate, although future work is needed to distinguish high resolution crop water use, water stress, and commodity transfers. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",About Sufficiency
"Green Devaluation: Disruption, Divestment, and Decommodification for a Green Economy","This paper argues that taking up questions of value can help political ecologists and economists develop a more powerful analysis of the green economy, as it introduces new urban, industrial, and technological dimensions into a self-identified green capitalism. More specifically, I maintain that processes of green devaluation, decommodification, and techno-industrial replacement are as important in understanding green economic development as new value enclosure and green growth. Twenty-first-century green economic politics have been marked by Schumpeterian ambitions and zero-sum intra-capitalist struggles, alongside a more general hardening of anti-fossil fuel industry politics from both grassroots climate justice activists and, increasingly, mainstream investors. I explore three interrelated initiatives—disruptive innovation in Silicon Valley cleantech, the U.S. fossil fuel divestment movement, and the global financial industry’s stranded assets organizing—as windows into these struggles. Themes of devaluation, obsolescence (both technological and “moral”), and (more or less absolute) decommodification carry through this discussion as activists struggle to translate quantitative advances against fossil fuels into a more profound qualitative break. Understanding these fights is essential to developing more effective engaged scholarship on climate change and a just energy transition. © 2016 The Center for Political Ecology.",About Sufficiency
Integrating mitigation and adaptation into climate and development policy: Three research questions,"The potential for developing synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation has become a recent focus of both climate research and policy. Presumably the interest in synergies springs from the appeal of creating win-win situations by implementing a single climate policy option. However, institutional complexity, insufficient opportunities and uncertainty surrounding their efficiency and effectiveness present major challenges to the widespread development of synergies. There are also increasing calls for research to define the optimal mix of mitigation and adaptation. These calls are based on the misguided assumption that there is one single optimal mix of adaptation and mitigation options for all possible scenarios of climate and socio-economic change, notwithstanding uncertainty and irrespective of the diversity of values and preferences in society. In the face of current uncertainty, research is needed to provide guidance on how to develop a socially and economically justifiable mix of mitigation, adaptation and development policy, as well as on which elements would be part of such a mix. Moreover, research is needed to establish the conditions under which the process of mainstreaming can be most effective. Rather than actually developing and implementing specific mitigation and adaptation options, the objective of climate policy should be to facilitate such development and implementation as part of sectoral policies. Finally, analysis needs to focus on the optimal use and expected effectiveness of financial instruments, taking into account the mutual effects between these instruments on the one hand, and national and international sectoral investments and official development assistance on the other. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Evolving factors affecting energy security,"Concentrated solar power is a promising technique involving the deployment of hundreds or thousands of revolving mirrors used to focus solar energy on a column of liquid, which in turn generates steam for electric turbines. Climate change is one of several factors, including over withdrawal contributing to global water scarcity. The international energy system is in a state of constant change. Climate change’s direct impacts on energy systems and resources are likely to have more negative than positive impacts on the global supply of energy. Trends in the geopolitics of energy are raising a number of concerns. Vulnerabilities in energy production, trade and distribution systems are increasingly apparent. The rise in US energy production is considerable and it has boosted energy security. Energy demand in the power sector is likely to correlate more closely with demographic change.

"Particulate matter 2.5 air pollution mitigation strategy: the role of green investment, digitalization, and renewable energy in the organization for economic co-operation and development (OECD) countries","The catastrophe of air pollution is an alarming and pervasive global issue. It arises from the emission of harmful substances into the earth’s atmosphere, resulting in the contamination of the air that we breathe. This pollution primarily stems from human activities, including industrial processes, transportation, agriculture, and energy production. This paper examines the links between green investment, digitalization, renewable energy, export, and economic growth for a total of 30 organization for economic co-operation and development economies over the period between 1990 and 2020 to empirically probe the magnitude and the effect of green investment, economic growth, digitalization, export, and renewable energy on PM2.5 air pollution. We evaluated the panel for numerous diagnostic tests including a long-run co-integration link that is acknowledged among the variables under investigation. The superior econometric estimation method of moment quantiles regression validates that economic growth is inimical. At the same time, green investment, renewable energy, export, and digitalization illustrate heterogeneous effects on PM2.5 air pollution. Based on the findings, it is found that excluding economic growth, the explanatory variables effectively reduce PM2.5 air pollution in the organization for economic co-operation and development countries. Nonetheless, the extent of the green investment increases a proper inquiry which portrays a mitigating trend across the quantiles based on the outcomes, government, and policymakers should implement these policies and foster a holistic approach that combines green investment and digitalization, so that can significantly reduce PM2.5, protect public health, and promote sustainable economic growth.

"Exploring the nexus between energy consumption, income inequality and poverty, economic growth, and carbon dioxide emission: evidence from two step system generalized method of moments","The concern of environmental degradation, poverty, and income inequality remains a priority in achieving sustainable development goals. Countries are trying to reduce income inequality, alleviate poverty, and reduce environmental degradation which needs special attention. Consequently, this study explores the effect of income inequality, poverty, and energy consumption on carbon dioxide emission in the Belt and Road Initiative countries from 1996 to 2018. By employing the generalized method of moments, the findings show that income inequality, poverty, and energy consumption significantly increase carbon dioxide emission and lead to environmental degradation, while access to electricity significantly raises environmental quality. Economic growth positively affects carbon dioxide emission; however, the environmental Kuznets curve is valid. Income inequality exerts a moderating effect on carbon dioxide emission via per capita economic growth that reduces environmental degradation in the Belt and Road Initiative countries.

"Synergy between climate risk perception, adaptation responses, and agricultural productivity: the case of rice farming communities in Pakistan","The climate variability in Pakistan adversely affects rice crops and undermines the food security and livelihoods of millions of rural households whose survival depends directly on rice farming. This study examines farmers’ risk perception, adaptation responses, and adaptation impact on rice productivity. We employed a multi-stage sampling method for selecting 480 farmers from the rice production zone of Punjab province, a region that produces more than 60% of the total rice in the country and faces significant production decline due to climate change. We used the risk matrix method to determine farmers’ perception of climate change-induced risk and used the propensity score matching (PSM) technique to analyze the impact of adaptation measures on rice yield and crop returns. Results show that farmers had high perceptions and were concerned about biological and financial risks, followed by biophysical, atmospheric, and social risks. Farmers applied supplementary irrigation, changed rice cultivation dates, changed rice varieties, resized farms, and altered irrigation application times as adaptation measures to cope with changing climate effects. Probit regression analysis showed that the adaptation measures had been largely affected by farmers’ socioeconomic attributes and risk perceptions. The PSM estimates showed that all adaptation measures had a positive impact on rice yield and crop return. Specifically, the cultivation of alternative rice varieties, farm resizing, and supplementary irrigation were the most effective strategies, followed by the adjustment in cultivation dates and irrigation time. Having implications beyond Pakistan, this study suggests improving farmers’ access to irrigation water, credit, and farm advisory services to facilitate the extent of adaptation.

The role of innovations and renewable energy consumption in reducing environmental degradation in OECD countries: an investigation for Innovation Claudia Curve,"Rising economic growth in recent ages is the primary concern of most of the countries to enhance the living standard, but the ever-increasing production of economic activities consumes a lot of energy, which leads to a sharp increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Innovation may be a remedy that can help improve energy efficiency, obtain renewable energy, and promote economic growth, thereby protecting the quality of the environment. Therefore, this paper examines the role of innovation and renewable energy consumption in CO2 reduction in OECD countries from 2004 to 2019. By using the two-step system generalized of moment estimator, the results show that economic growth and innovation significantly increase carbon emissions, however the innovation Claudia Curve (ICC) is verified, and the environmental Kuznets curve does not exist. Foreign direct investment has a negative impact on carbon emissions, thus verifying the Pollution Hao hypothesis, whereas renewable energy also improves environmental quality, but the interaction between innovation and renewable energy consumption still increases carbon emissions. Financial development, industrialization, trade, and energy consumption have also been found to be harmful factors of environmental quality. Our findings have considerable policy implications for OECD countries on the improvement of innovation indicators and investment in renewable energy sources to rise environmental quality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",About Sufficiency
Exposure to compound climate hazards transmitted via global agricultural trade networks,"Compound climate hazards, such as co-occurring temperature and precipitation extremes, substantially impact people and ecosystems. Internal climate variability combines with the forced global warming response to determine both the magnitude and spatial distribution of these events, and their consequences can propagate from one country to another via many pathways. We examine how exposure to compound climate hazards in one country is transmitted internationally via agricultural trade networks by analyzing a large ensemble of climate model simulations and comprehensive trade data of four crops (i.e. wheat, maize, rice and soya). Combinations of variability-driven climate patterns and existing global agricultural trade give rise to a wide range of possible outcomes in the current climate. In the most extreme simulated year, 20% or more of the caloric supply in nearly one third of the world’s countries are exposed to compound heat and precipitation hazards. Countries with low levels of diversification, both in the number of suppliers and the regional climates of those suppliers, are more likely to import higher fractions of calories (up to 93%) that are exposed to these compound hazards. Understanding how calories exposed to climate hazards are transmitted through agricultural trade networks in the current climate can contribute to improved anticipatory capacity for national governments, international trade policy, and agricultural-sector resilience. Our results highlight the need for concerted effort toward merging cutting-edge seasonal-to-decadal climate prediction with international trade analysis in support of a new era of anticipatory Anthropocene risk management. © 2025 The Author(s).

Successful wastewater reuse scheme and sustainable development: A case study in Adelaide,"Freshwater availability to meet the growing needs of humankind has raised serious concerns in the recent past. Two immediate responses to counter this challenge are efficient allocation of the scarce resources, and development and use of alternative sources of water. While 'water markets' are seen as a means to achieve efficient allocation of the scare resources, treated wastewater and low-quality water are now considered as potential sources of water to supplement the freshwater supplies. However, the latter option, that is use of reclaimed water as an alternative, imposes concerns regarding its suitability to sustain development. This is because of various issues related to wastewater usage and application. At the same time, it is also true that a successful and well-planned reuse scheme can help achieve sustainability as evidenced in some isolated cases around the world. In line with this, the current paper adopts a case-study approach to demonstrate how a successful reuse scheme in Adelaide, South Australia, has contributed to the sustainable development of the region.

Greening the Economy or Economizing the Green Project?

Transforming the seafood supply system: challenges and strategies for resilience,"Seafood is a crucial component of global food systems and plays a vital role in healthy diets and future food security, providing essential omega-3 fatty acids and micronutrients as well as incomes and livelihoods to millions of people. However, the seafood supply system is facing multiple contemporary global challenges that threaten its resilience as well as food security, livelihoods and ecological wellbeing. This opinion piece discusses the drivers of transformative change impacting seafood supply chains, with a particular focus on the UK, but the strategies described can be applied to many similarly developed countries. To address the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, escalating energy costs, climate change, risk management processes, and to ensure food security and resilience, active policy interventions are needed. Three key policy actions that policymakers can focus on are (i) sustainable seafood models, such as regenerative seafood systems and the circular economy, to improve both environmental and human health outcomes and the likelihood of meeting Sustainable Development Goals; (ii) promote local seafood as part of national food security to strengthen supply chains, support local communities, and enhance traceability and transparency; and, (iii) promote diversification in seafood sourcing and distribution to reduce pressure on critical stocks and increase the flexibility of food systems, while ensuring social and ecological protection. Building a more resilient and sustainable food system requires a holistic and integrated approach, alongside proactive collaboration, to address the multiple, complex, and long-term challenges facing the wider food system. © 2023, The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
Negative capital and the wealth of nations,"The so-called global economy has generated tremendous international wealth inequality that only increases as globalization deepens. This process is capped by the failure of classical economic theory to incorporate such free market externalities as negative capital. Negative capital can be defined as situations, events, or environmental conditions that degrade or threaten to degrade the standard of living or life expectancy of great numbers of persons, including those living in wealthy nations. These problems cut across issues of sovereignty and security, economic development, and the environment. They can be monetized and have value because the rich will have to pay in order to mitigate them, whether at home or abroad. Payment can take many forms, but it will involve a politics of redistribution.

As the 2030 Agenda emphasizes the integrated development of environmental, social, and economic dimensions, it is crucial to understand how agricultural practices affect sustainability. This study investigates the environmental impact of the agricultural sector on the green economy by examining key environmental factors, such as agricultural energy emissions, environmental taxes, irrigated water use efficiency, fertilizer use, and pesticide application. The analysis is conducted using the Panel Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) model, with robustness checks performed through the comparison with the Panel ARDL model, using data from 2000 to 2020. To assess the green economy, an index is constructed based on 20 indicators related to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The results show that agricultural energy emissions, despite their environmental cost, are positively associated with green economy development, highlighting the trade-off between high productivity and environmental degradation in a resource-efficient economy. Improved water use efficiency is found to enhance agricultural sustainability and production. Additionally, environmental taxes and regulations exert a significant positive effect on both environmental preservation and social welfare. Contrary to the belief that reducing agricultural production will lower carbon emissions, the study suggests that adopting environmentally friendly practices and imposing targeted taxes are more effective strategies. The findings also reveal a negative relationship between excessive fertilizer use and the green economy, indicating the need for minimal fertilizer application to promote sustainability. The study concludes with specific policy recommendations. Governments, particularly in countries that have not yet adopted sustainable agricultural practices, should implement environmental taxes and regulations to promote carbon neutrality and support the Sustainable Development Goals. These measures are essential to balancing economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social equity in the agricultural sector. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Rice Production in Punjab: Diversification of Some Rice Area Essential for Sustainable Agriculture,"Punjab has emerged as an important rice-producing state in the country. The state with 1.53 per cent of the geographical area of the country produces more than 11 per cent of total rice production in the country. During the pre-globalization era, the production of rice in Punjab increased more than 10 times due to an increase in area and yield. The growth of a rice crop at such a high rate over 20 years in Punjab is indeed a rare phenomenon in the history of agricultural development in the world. During the post-globalization era, growth in area and yield slowed down as it already reached a plateau. Due to extensive cultivation of rice in Punjab, the state has been over-exploiting the groundwater, more than its recharge. Most of the tube-well dominated districts of the state, witnessed the fall in water table more than 20 to 30 cm per year. To dispose of the paddy straw, the farmers of Punjab generally opt for burning it. This practice of burning of paddy straw besides nutrient loss is posing a serious problem for the public health and transportation system. Rice has now become a problematic crop for Punjab state due to its ill effects on its natural resources, that is, the water and soil environmental degradation. The Punjab Agricultural University experts and other committees estimated that the total groundwater recharge from all sources can sustain/support only 16-17 lakh ha of paddy in Punjab. The area under the crop increased to 29 lakh ha which was unsustainable in the long run. The area under rice in Punjab should be stabilised at 16-17 lakh ha and the remaining paddy area should be shifted to other crops like pulses, oilseeds, maize, fruits and vegetables, etc. requiring less water, to achieve proper water balance. Thus diversification of some area from paddy is in the interest of Punjab farmers, State government and the Central government for long term food security on a sustainable basis. © 2019 The Society of Economics and Development.",About Sufficiency
Beyond financing. Giving the United Nations power of the purse,"The present financial constraint on UN activities is primarily of a developmental-rather than strategic, geopolitical-nature. It stems from such factors as: the blurring of the dichotomy between North and South; caution about intergovernmental cooperation which might reduce national sovereignty; and hesitation to accept the need for a fundamentally new development paradigm. Yet, strengthening of the UN is at the same time one of the critical conditions required for the international community effectively to address the growing problems of global poverty, socioeconomic inequity and environmental degradation. It is, therefore, imperative urgently to find a way out of the present political stalemate surrounding the UN's role. The present article suggests two possible steps forward: 1. (1) to shift the burden of financing the UN from national to global sources-by introducing charges for the use of global commons or levies on international activities such as trade and foreign currency transactions; 2. (2) to strengthen the UN's capacity to harmonize global policy priorities with global spending priorities-by creating under the UN's umbrella, an integrated international cooperation fund and an executive committee for ECOSOC. © 1995.",About Sufficiency
Towards unlocking sustainable land consumption in sub-Saharan Africa: Analysing spatio-temporal variation of built-up land footprint and its determinants,"A systematic understanding of the dynamics of land consumption is extremely important for human well-being and especially vital for the ecological balance of the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region. Remarkable land use/land cover changes due to climate change, urbanization, and food demand have affected the spatio-temporal dynamics of built-up land footprints (BLFs) in SSA. By using spatial econometric techniques, this study investigates the spatio-temporal evolution and key drivers of built-up land footprints in 28 SSA countries from 2000 to 2017. Our results show how an appropriate consideration of the role of spatial effects can shed new insights into the convergence process of built-up land footprints. Foremost, the study reveals significant evidence of both absolute and conditional β convergence in BLFs over the experimental period. Additionally, the estimation indicates that biocapacity plays an important role in cutting built-up land footprints in SSA countries as there was a faster conditional convergence in countries with higher biocapacity. Moreover, the study outlined that the promotion of globalization and urbanization draws more pressure on the built-up environment and makes it challenging to reduce BLFs in SSA. In addition, this study found evidence for an inverted U-shaped nexus between per capita built-up land footprints and per capita gross domestic product (GDP), supporting the prediction of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. © 2022 The Authors",About Sufficiency
"The Future, Development Economics and Global Policy Actions","The notion of international development has evolved giving new meanings to the discipline of development economics. This evolution has been the product of the flux in the global economy affecting both ‘developing’ and ‘developed’ countries. Three broad areas of concern are: First, the extent to which there is any type of consensus around which ‘current issues’ are most important—and why. Second, whether there is any consensus about the analytical methods which are appropriate for an understanding of the main characteristics of the ‘issues’ within economics or ‘political economy’. Third, whether there is any consensus about the nature of economic policies (and strategies) which can be used to address these issues effectively. There is need for a heterodox lens to address the mega-questions that both developed and developing countries will have to contend with in the next few decades: climate change; issues of development financing and cooperation; artificial intelligence, innovations and the world of work; pandemics and public health; population, migration and demographic dividends; human rights and (de)globalisation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",About Sufficiency
Analysis of deforestation and economically sustainable farming systems under pressure of population growth and income constraints at the village level in Tanzania,"The main aim of this paper is to apply mathematical programming and welfare maximization theory to analyze the effect of population growth on agriculture/forest land use competition, per capita cash income and subsistence consumption from privately owned farms as a basis to determine the economic sustainability of the present farming systems in the West Usambara Mountains. Two working hypotheses are presented: (1) given present population growth trends, present farming systems are not economically sustainable; (2) population growth will cause deforestation over time due to the expansion of farmlands. The analysis presented in this paper indicates that the present farming systems can sustain the present population growth rate (2.1% per annum for Lukozi Village) and per capita income for a maximum duration of 25-30 years. Life expectancy in Tanzania is over 45 years (based on 1988 population census). Thus, the present farming systems cannot sustain even one human generation. This suggests that, for the existing farming systems to become economically sustainable, it is important to improve farming technology which could increase crop production through improvements of land productivity, and to increase income from other sources. Such a strategy will meet the increased food demand as a result of population growth as well as limiting the expansion of farmlands through forest clearing. In addition, the welfare of the farmers and rural populace could be enhanced and improved. Also, it might be relevant to expand small-scale industrial activities to increase income from off-farm activities.",About Sufficiency
Post-growth: the science of wellbeing within planetary boundaries,"There are increasing concerns that continued economic growth in high-income countries might not be environmentally sustainable, socially beneficial, or economically achievable. In this Review, we explore the rapidly advancing field of post-growth research, which has evolved in response to these concerns. The central idea of post-growth is to replace the goal of increasing GDP with the goal of improving human wellbeing within planetary boundaries. Key advances discussed in this Review include: the development of ecological macroeconomic models that test policies for managing without growth; understanding and reducing the growth dependencies that tie social welfare to increasing GDP in the current economy; and characterising the policies and provisioning systems that would allow resource use to be reduced while improving human wellbeing. Despite recent advances in post-growth research, important questions remain, such as the politics of transition, and transformations in the relationship between the Global North and the Global South. © 2025 The Author(s).

Climate change mitigation policies in agriculture: An overview of sociopolitical barriers,"The realization of the economic and technical potential of climate mitigation policies in agriculture is influenced by how sociopolitical issues are considered in policy development and implementation. Based on a narrative review of the literature, this article provides an overview of common sociopolitical barriers facing supply-side and demand-side mitigation measures in agriculture. Understanding these sociopolitical issues can provide opportunities for the full realization of mitigation policy potentials. They are presented under four themes: local context, adoption capacity, and distributional impacts; food security, costs, and choices in food consumption; political considerations related to electoral weight and lobbying; and international aspects regarding emissions metrics, trade, and big agriculture. Designing complementary policies and second-best options, incorporating local knowledge in policy design, recognizing women's voice and role in sustainable agriculture, planning for job transitions, engaging stakeholders through multiscalar platforms, and appropriately framing and communicating policies in a digestible manner are some considerations to address these sociopolitical barriers.

A review of the assessment of sustainable water use at continental-to-global scale,"Freshwater scarcity and unsustainable water use are just some of the growing concerns in many parts of the world. Increasing water demand accompanied by a changing climate can lead to unsustainable use of freshwater resulting in water scarcity. Several studies have quantified sustainable water use and water scarcity at a continental-to-global scale in the past. This review focuses on the large-scale water resources assessments and the methods by which sustainable water use and water scarcity are quantified. The review is structured based on a framework that comprises the main components of water demand and supply and other aspects of sustainable water use including virtual water trade and future projections of sustainable water use. The major components of water demand and supply in such assessments are increasingly derived from global earth system models and national-level census datasets. These assessments conclude that the selection of appropriate spatial and temporal scales is critical. The grid-based global earth system models enable better spatial resampling of water information across country/political boundaries. Similarly, by refining the temporal scale from annual (the most commonly used temporal scale of assessment) to monthly time steps, water scarcity is better captured due to the distinctive seasonality of water availability and demand. This paper also discusses the role of major drivers of water scarcity. Although both changing climate and increasing water demand contribute to water scarcity, the majority of the literature concludes that the demand-driven freshwater scarcity has a much greater impact than that induced by climate change. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",About Sufficiency

Examining the Success Factors for Sustainable Development in Nigeria's Economic Growth and Development,"Sustainable Development (SD) is a concept of socially inclusive approach, resource-efficient, with low-carbon measures bolstered by public and private investment partnerships in economic activities and infrastructural projects that minimizes carbon emissions pollution reductions, improves energy usage, and ultimately prevents the loss of biodiversity within the ecosystem services for humankind. Implementing SD policies is paradoxically challenging for a Nigeria and other African countries due to significant factors affecting the success of such policies and efforts within its economy. This study examined 11success factors (SFs) that affects SD in Nigeria's economy. The results show the huge impact of stakeholders on the success of the SD efforts in Nigeria. In addition, SD policy implementation, enforcement, and adaptability may take years or decades, but once embedded in overall economic sectors, organizational operations, and corporate social responsibilities, as well as the majority of the population's respective activities, the positive social, economic, and environmental sustainability impacts, will be profound. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Foreign demand for agricultural commodities drives virtual carbon exports from Cambodia,"Rapid deforestation is a major sustainability challenge, partly as the loss of carbon sinks exacerbates global climate change. In Cambodia, more than 13% of the total land area has been contracted out to foreign and domestic agribusinesses in the form of economic land concessions, causing rapid large-scale land use change and deforestation. Additionally, the distant drivers of local and global environmental change often remain invisible. Here, we identify hotspots of carbon loss between 1987-2017 using the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS and by comparing past and present land use and land cover. We also link global consumption and production patterns to their environmental effects in Cambodia by mapping the countries to which land-use embedded carbon are exported. We find that natural forests have decreased from 54%-21% between 1987 and 2017, mainly for the expansion of farmland and orchards, translating into 300 million tons of carbon lost, with loss rates over twice as high within economic land concessions. China is the largest importer of embedded carbon, mainly for rubber and sugarcane from Chinese agribusinesses. Cambodian investors have also negatively affected carbon pools through export-oriented products like rubber. The combined understanding of environmental change and trade flows makes it possible to identify distant drivers of deforestation, which is important for crafting more environmentally and socially responsible policies on national and transnational scales. © 2020 The Author(s).

Balancing the use of wetlands for economic well-being and ecological security: The case of the Limpopo wetland in southern Africa,"Wetlands in southern Africa continue to be degraded and lost through conversion to agriculture and other uses. One of the major constraints to sustainable management of wetlands in the region is that wetland users and decision-makers have insufficient understanding of the consequences of alternative management and policy regimes on wetland functioning, ecosystem services and human well-being. This study developed an ecological-economic model based on the system dynamics framework to simulate the impacts of alternative policy regimes on wetland functioning and economic well-being. Results showed that wetland services (crop production and natural resource harvesting) are inter-linked with trade-offs involved through their competition for labour, land and water resources. Policy scenario simulation results showed that diversifying livelihoods out of agriculture simultaneously improves economic well-being and enhances wetland conservation. Pure conservation strategies impose significant losses in the economic welfare of local population unless supported with diversification of livelihood sources. Government policies that support livelihood diversification into off-farm livelihood opportunities for the rural poor are critical for sustainable wetland management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Bolivia - export promotion and its effects on growth, employment and poverty","The initial efforts and reforms for stabilization in Bolivia led to moderate but stable growth and some reduction in poverty during most of the 1990s. Towards the end of the decade, nearing the twenty-first century, growth slowed down and poverty increased again. Trade liberalization and capital inflows stimulated export growth and increased the propensity to import. Non-traditional exports took a larger share of overall exports, and exports were the primary source of growth in aggregate output during most of the 1990s. The export-led growth process continues to be based on natural resources, but includes both agricultural (e.g. soya beans) and processed mineral products (e.g. jewels) as new export items. The growth path has not proved to be very stable or sustainable. Performance of exports has been quite vulnerable to economic shocks in neighbouring countries. The growing share of non-traditional exports has been due primarily to the further collapse of traditional exports, particularly natural gas and petroleum products that depend on Argentinean and Brazilian markets. Growth in non-traditional exports has decelerated after 1999 and this has affected the overall growth of the economy. Unemployment rates have increased again to levels close to those recorded at the end of the 1980s, and new emergency employment programmes are being implemented to absorb the social cost of declining economic growth. Real labour income has not shown any increase in the second half of the 1990s, with unskilled workers being the most negatively affected. In 2000, real labour income of unskilled urban workers fell 20 per cent relative to the 1989 levels, while that of skilled urban workers rose approximately 20 per cent. Increased skill intensity and widening wage gaps are also reflected in rising per capita income inequality at the household level. Macro-micro CGE simulations show that the effects of trade liberalization and greater trade integration on aggregate employment and wages would counteract these outcomes. These positive wage and employment outcomes can only materialize, however, if Bolivia's major trading partners are able to emerge from their recessions. Bolivia's dependence on aid and its vulnerability to the volatility of the primary goods markets has not disappeared despite almost two decades of economic reforms. The introduction of social protection programmes provided but small compensation for the economic shocks to which so many Bolivian households remain vulnerable. © 2006 Rob Vos, Enrique Ganuza, Samuel Morley and Sherman Robinson.

Achieving balance between socioeconomic development and ecosystem conservation via policy adjustments in Guangdong Province of southeastern China,"Rapid urbanization improves socioeconomic development but challenges ecosystem sustainability. Meanwhile, the gradient responses of ecosystem services (ESs) to landscape structures and associated regime shifts of the agriculture–ecosystem–economy nexus (AEEN) have not been sufficiently addressed, preventing an effective balance between socioeconomic prosperity and ecosystem conservation. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study selected the Guangdong Province of southeastern China to explore landscape dynamics from 1985 to 2020 and their spatially heterogeneous impacts on ESs and the AEEN, based on Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs approach and other biophysical models as well as statistical records about socioeconomic factors. AEEN elements, including ESs, responded directly to policy adjustments in terms of ecosystem restoration and landscape management and presented remarkable regime shifts (i.e., phase changes) and spatial heterogeneity. Aggressive agricultural reclamation before 1999 increased crop productivity but caused vegetation degradation and biomass decline. Accelerated urban expansion and ecosystem restoration efforts have improved economic and ecological benefits but have substantially reduced crop productivity and threatened food security. However, timely policy adjustments since 2009 reversed the declining trend and maintained the grain supply. Landscape composition presented patterns of gradual decline along the urban–rural gradient, which in turn determined ES gradient patterns. For instance, water yield and nitrogen export positively correlated with each other (p < 0.0001) but negatively correlated with other ESs. Our study enriches the understandings of social–ecological systems’ response to man-made interventions from AEEN perspective allowing for spatial variabilities and regime shifts, which support policy formulation for coordinating ecological and economic benefits.

"Assessing environmental, social, and governance performance and natural resource management policies in China's dual carbon era for a green economy","As the globe faces urgent environmental concerns and the need to move toward a greener and more sustainable economy, the idea of sustainability has received a lot of attention recently. Evaluation of the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and natural resource management (NRM) policy options are crucial given the urgent environmental issues the world is facing and the requirement for sustainable development. The objective of this study is to assess China's ESG performance and NRM policy options in the dual carbon era for developing green economy. The dual carbon places a focus on the need of lessening carbon emissions and encouraging low-carbon activities and technologies. A hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods i.e. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)-GREY are used to evaluate and prioritize the criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. The FAHP method is used to assess the criteria and sub-criteria of ESG performance. Moreover, the TOPSIS-Grey method is employed to prioritize the NRM policy options. The findings of FAHP analysis reveal that environment is the most crucial criteria, followed by governance and social performance. While the TOPSIS-Grey analysis show that green finance and investment, policy and regulatory reforms, and circular economy practices are the most suitable NRM policy options. China can significantly advance toward a more ecologically and socially responsible future while fostering economic growth and prosperity in the dual carbon era by implementing the recommended sustainable practices and policies. © 2023",About Sufficiency
"Renewable energy, trade diversification and environmental footprints: Evidence for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)","The prime objective of this research is to explore the impacts of import and export diversification and renewable energy on environmental footprints. In doing so, the authors employ the data of trade diversification, income inequality, renewable energy, and ecological footprints for 17 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries covering the period of 1995–2019. In econometric framework, the authors use two baseline empirical models based on key indicators such as trade (exports and imports) diversification index, income inequality, renewable energy, and globalization. The empirical analysis from both specifications suggests a cointegrating relation between the key variables of interest. The Long-run empirical estimates from FMOLS, and DOLS methods indicate that income inequality and import diversification increase ecological issues while globalization and exports diversification abate it. Further analysis through Granger causality highlights unilateral causal relationships running from renewable energy consumption to imports diversification, and from ecological footprint to imports diversification. The conclusions of this study stress the importance of harmonic policies, synchronization in trade, energy and resource consumption in achieving sustainable development goals. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Urban water resources quota management: The core strategy for water demand management in China,"Since China has the largest population in the world, the available water resources per capita in China are very limited. With the rapid economic development that is currently occurring, the shortage of water resources at the national level has become extremely critical. How to solve the problems due to water scarcity and water pollution has received increasing attention from the Chinese government and various communities. In order to provide a sustainable development environment for 1.6 billion people in the future, the whole country has started to reform urban water resources management systems in terms of related policies, regulations, methodologies, and technologies focusing on improving the efficiency and effectiveness in water use. Urban water quota management has now become a core strategy in developing a water resources governance model for water demand management aiming at establishing a water-saving society. This paper introduces the main stages and the processes of implementing water quota management in China, analyzes the basic principles, and expounds the elements, information foundation, core module and operational model of the urban water quota management system. It has been demonstrated that urban water quota management has made some remarkable contribution not only in transforming the pattern of water mode and strengthening water management enforcement but also in integrating various management methods in saving water and preventing pollution. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2010.",About Sufficiency
Water pollution control promotes sustainable water use in Yangtze River Economic Belt——from water footprint perspective,"The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), characterized by its dense population and dynamic industrial activities, is facing unprecedented challenges in balancing water resource utilization with environmental protection. Understanding the interplay between water environment and economic development is crucial for the YREB. In this study, the dynamics of sustainable state and driving mechanism for water utilization examined from a Water Footprint (WF) perspective at regional and sectoral scales from 2002 to 2017. The analysis is facilitated by a novel framework that integrates WF sustainability and equilibrium assessment for water pollution and scarcity stresses with structural decomposition analysis (SDA), based on multiregional input-output (MRIO) dataset. The results reveal that the YREB had an extremely high grey WF (GWF), approximately nine times higher than the blue WF (BWF), yet has consistently decreased by 210.00 billion m3 during 2002–2017, indicating a greater but mitigated stress from water pollution compared to water scarcity. Our analysis shows an increase in the Sustainability Index (SI) of YREB from 0.3706 to 0.4435, primarily due to the reduction in GWF. Water use equality among the three major sectors has also improved. The decomposition results highlight that water conservation and treatment technologies have the most significant impact on reducing WFs, followed by shifts in consumption patterns and adjustments in industry structure, all of which enhance the water sustainability of the YREB. This study underscores the critical role of water pollution control in ensuring sustainable water resource use, as reducing pollution loads supports responsible water exploitation, leading to improved water quality and optimized resource efficiency.

Integration of Vegetables and Fish with Rice in Rain-Fed Farmland: Towards Sustainable Agriculture,"Sustainability in aquaculture or agriculture production is depended on its successive use of natural resources that can ensure economic increment and sustainability of the livelihood of people. The objective of the study was to find out suitable combination of rice-fish-vegetable to be cultured in rainfed rice field. Two experiments were conducted for 4 months under rainfed condition. Two rice varieties (BRRI-51 and BRRI-52), three different fish species. i.e., Cyprinus carpio var. communis, Barbonymus gonionotus and Oreochromis niloticus and two combinations of vegetables (Red amaranth + Indian spinach and Cucumber + Water spinach) were selected for these experiments. Significantly higher growth and production performance of fish, B. gonionotus were recorded in both of the experiments. Furthermore, between the rice varieties, BRRI-52 showed significantly higher grain yield, biological yield and harvest index. However, vegetable combination did not show any significant difference between the experiment. Finally, considering economic performance, integration of BRRI-52, B. gonionotus and Cucumber-spinach combinations was provided significantly higher net benefit and benefit-cost ratio (BCR). Therefore, combination of rice-fish-vegetable BRRI-52, B. gonionotus and Cucumber-spinach is recommended to improve food security and sustainability for resource-limited farmers in rainfed rice field. Rice-fish-vegetable integrated culture could address the sustainable development goals (SDG) and therefore policy implications should be considered for institutional support, technical facilities and extension services to increase the knowledge of farmers and to uplift the productivity and profitability. © 2023 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Wage-led demand as a rebalancing strategy for economic growth in China,"Rebalancing growth in favor of domestic consumption has been an objective of Chinese policy makers for over two decades. However, until recently little progress has been achieved. This article argues that the nature of the demand regime is a major reason for the limited rebalancing operated thus far. Until the great recession (2008–09), Chinese growth was profit-led, which means that an increase in the profit share of income had a positive effect on investment and net exports that exceeded the negative effect on consumption. The fact that the profit share increased by 10 percentage points explains why the rate of growth boomed over the 1996–2007 period. We show that after the great recession, China’s demand regime turned wage-led, which means that an increase in the wage share results in a positive effect on households’ consumption which exceeds the negative effect on investment and net exports. The conclusion is that a pro-labor policy may now contribute to rebalance China’s growth and make it less dependent on exports, overinvestment and carbon-intensive industries. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",About Sufficiency
"TCO macro view - Monetary valuation of environmental, social & economic impacts of NGV development and case study of France","To meet the challenges related to global warming, transition to low carbon technologies are underway in most economic activities. Government energy and climate policies are the core to achieve the target of limiting the rise in global temperature to well below 2°C, as set out in the Paris Agreement. Besides, low carbon technologies cannot only help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also contribute to job creation, nation's competitiveness, and improvement of air quality. Thus, the co-benefits (externalities) should also be monetarized in order to be able to compare them to the costs and benefits already expressed in currency and support the decision making process of policy makers and public authorities. Natural gas and renewable gas are identified as one of the most efficient alternative fuels in the transport sector with benefits like: less emissions of greenhouse gases, less emissions of air pollutions, lower noises as well as the job creation in emerging sectors around NGV (natural gas vehicle) and trade balance of energy import. A topic of Working Group 5.3 of IGU (International Gas Union) has been to build a tool to monetarize the co-benefits of NGV development with combining environmental, social and economic impacts to allow members to simulate their national cases. © 27th World Gas Conference, WGC 2018.

"Analysing the implications of electrification of public transport buses in Pune city, India","The urban road transport sector in India currently faces the challenge of increased travel demand, increased use of private vehicles, traffic congestion as well as alarming levels of air pollution. The consequent public health problems, energy insecurity resulting from oil imports and pressure to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from the sector have also emerged as serious challenges for the country. Many cities in the world are considering electric buses for public transport as one of the potential solutions to address these issues. This article analyses the feasibility of introducing electric buses in the public transport fleet by estimating the financial burden that such a shift may entail, and the corresponding emissions it would mitigate. It also provides a methodology and illustrates the same for a city in India. The results indicate that while electric buses may not be financially viable at present and require state support and subsidies for operation, careful planning and phased implementation would make them a promising option for the future. The cost analysis indicates that for the immediate future, the replacement of air-conditioned diesel buses with similar electric buses in the fleet makes better economic sense. However, it is necessary to determine how the increased cost of using electric buses is to be distributed across the population of the city to avoid disproportionately burdening one section, i.e. bus commuters, with the cost of cleaning up the city's air. © 2022.

“Are the working principles of fisheries management at work in Indonesia?”,"Indonesia, the world's largest archipelagic nation and second-largest fish producer in the world, has fisheries distinguished by a high diversity of species and with a large variety of gear and methods used to fish over expansive geographic areas. Fisheries management in Indonesia is equally complex with multiple levels of governance, decentralization, and traditional fishing tenure rights. The Government of Indonesia is taking strides to improve fisheries management in a changing and complex environment to support sustainable economic development, livelihoods, and food security of its people. This paper takes stock of recent developments in fisheries science and management in the country and identifies additional opportunities for improvement. An analytic framework for evaluating progress and opportunities for fisheries management has been adapted from a set of eight working principles for effective fisheries management. Analysis of each principle revealed that although current Indonesian fishery management includes landing data collections, onboard observer programs, logbooks, e-logbooks, catch per unit effort (CPUE) standardization, regional fisheries management units, genetic assessments, vessel tracking, and similar tools to improve fisheries management, significant work remains. Although the use of data is pivotal in the development of fisheries solutions, data inputs are still not adequate to perform fully reliable assessments. Indonesia's pool of experts remains insufficient to meet the extensive stock assessment needs across the country and thus continuous training and mentoring of assessors in techniques relevant for different stock types and data levels is crucial to ensure skills enhancement. Indonesia's interdisciplinary stock assessment review body, Komnas KAJISKAN, plays a critical role by providing scientific guidance that balances short-term economic needs from the perspectives of fishers and policymakers with the ecological constraints required for long-term fishery sustainability. Although small-scale fisheries dominate Indonesia's fisheries management system, the process of decentralizing data collection and management functions to province, district, and village levels is alone not sufficient to encourage more local ownership and compliance. Tools such as customary rules of conduct, marine protected areas, and other local area management regimes can also help to successfully manage small-scale fisheries and marine resources. Provincial licensing and boat classifications remain issues that require continued attention, simplification, and clarification. Finally, an enhanced national policy framework that empowers and engages local governments, universities, NGOs, fishers and community groups who are adequately trained, staffed, and funded would significantly strengthen fisheries science through improved data collection, processing, and interpretation to benefit management. In conclusion, the threat of overfishing in Indonesia's fisheries is visible in the data, and trends suggest a similar pathway involving unsustainable production goals and escalating overfishing as followed by neighboring countries that experienced fisheries collapse. Time is of the essence in recognizing this trajectory and adjusting policies to maintain and sustain the country's natural fisheries wealth for the present and future generations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
"Determinants of Food Security: A Comprehensive Analysis Across East, South, and Southeast Asia","The role of food security has continuously been increasing during the recent decades and especially due to recent crises. This study investigates the determinants of food security in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia—regions that are critical to global food security due to their substantial population and agricultural output. Utilising a dataset spanning from 2001 to 2021 and employing a random effects regression model, this paper examines the influence of economic growth, agricultural performance, open economic activities, climate change, and crisis situations on food security. The study covers 357 observations from 17 countries within the selected regions. Results suggest that the relationship between economic growth and food security is not straightforward across the regions. While agricultural performance generally supports food security, the impact of open economic activities and external shocks like conflicts and climate change vary. Notably, recent global crises have had nuanced effects on food security, while the prevalence of undernourishment steadily decreased despite of the crisis events. The study highlights the complexity of achieving food security in Asia and the need for sustainable region-specific policies addressing both structural and transitory challenges. Policymakers need to consider a broader range of factors, related to sustainability, to effectively combat hunger and undernutrition. © 2024 by the author(s).",About Sufficiency
The Intertwined Renewable Energy–Water–Environment (REWE) Nexus Challenges and Opportunities: A Case Study of California,"In our built environment, societal production of energy and clean water is inextricably linked to the natural resources from which they are derived. Acknowledgement and consideration of the coupling of energy, water, and the environment (the energy–water–environment nexus) will be critical to a sustainable future. This is particularly true as we transition away from historical energy sources (e.g., coal, petroleum, natural gas) and into the widespread adaptation of renewable energy (RE) sources (e.g., solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, bioenergy) as a strategy to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and consequently slow global climate change. This transition is fraught with both challenges and opportunities at the county, state, national, and international levels, as addressing future societal needs with respect to energy and water, and the environment requires recognition of their interdependence and development of new technologies and societal practices. In this study, the focus is on the RE–water–environment (REWE) nexus. In California, the REWE nexus is becoming increasingly important in achieving 100% clean electricity from eligible RE and zero-carbon resources by 2045 and in the face of climate change and population and economic growth. In this context, California’s RE deployment and renewable electrical generation, its RE legislative information, REWE nexus, and intertwined REWE nexus challenges and opportunities in California (e.g., administrative–legal, technology development, digitalization, and end-of-life RE waste) are comprehensively discussed to identify the knowledge gaps in this nexus and solutions. © 2023 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Toward sustainability in lower mekong river basin development,"The Lower Mekong River Basin of Southeast Asia is at an important juncture in its path of development. The natural resource base upon which future development will depend is being undermined by deforestation. Poverty in many places in the basin provides few options other than continued use of the forests for fuelwood, slash-and burn agriculture, as well as commercial uses. The Mekong River holds great potential in helping meet the region's energy and food requirements, especially given the low level of water development in the basin. It is generally accepted that any development program must account for a range of socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. The record of wafer development projects in the basin holds clues about their strengths and weaknesses in promoting environmentally-and socially-responsible development. Reviewing past work also shows how the emphasis of wafer development programs has changed during the past two to three decades. A review of the contemporary work program of the Mekong Committee and Secretariat reflects the extent to which they have learned such lessons and. in turn, their potential for contributing to more sustainable development in the basin. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",About Sufficiency
Impact of Energy Transition on the Factors Shaping International Oil and Gas Companies' Corporate Strategy,"Oil has played a crucial role in the global economy since its discovery in the mid-19th century. Due to technological advancements, oil became a crucial energy source in the 20th century, and its demand has risen in tandem with economic advancements since its discovery (Fattouh et al., 2019). Apart from oil being crucial for modern transportation, as the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2018, p. 12) stated, ""most items created today, from apparel to autos to agricultural inputs to medical stockpiles are all derived from fossil- fuel by-products"". As per OPEC (2004) estimates, over the 20th and into the 21st centuries, industrial production of oil increased by roughly fifty (50) folds. Hence, oil was dubbed as the ""lifeblood"" of modern civilisation, and affectionately referred to as the ""black gold"" by industry players. And during this period fossil-fuels (oil, gas and coal) have been the most critical energy source available globally (Bahgat, 2003).Fossil- fuels supplied more than 85% of the total energy supplied or consumed in 2019 globally (IEA, 2019).As a result of being crucial to modern society and a key energy source globally, oil and gas have become a huge geopolitical tool. Oil reserves, price, ownership, and accompanying riches all have had an impact on global economics and geopolitics. The Paris Accord is a legally binding global treaty on climate change that was signed by 196 territories to ""limit global warming to below 2°C, preferably 1.5°C, in contrast to pre-industrial levels"". To remain within the global carbon emission targets, a sturdy energy transition with a reduction in fossil-fuel demand is needed (Rogelj et al., 2019). The Accord should serve as motivation for IOCs to adapt their corporate strategies to the evolving ecosystem of the energy transition. But the IOCs' response, meanwhile, has been quite inconsistent up to this point. Some have refused to set concrete aims, and are spending more on initiatives that contradict the Paris goals and objectives (UNFCCC, 2016). Theenergy demand is expected to continue to rise as societies advance and citizens seek out an improved living standard.In 2017, energy demand soared, with fossil-fuels accounting for more than 80% of the energy mix.Hence, the want for ""more energy and less carbon"" is a doublesocial dilemma (BP, 2018: IEA, 2018). The emergence of issues regarding global warming, climate change, and the rise of the low-carbon economy has generated added pressure on states and corporations to reduce their carbon footprint (i.e. decarbonise) activities within their economies and corporations. It has become a change agenda to address issues regarding climate change, and this is due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) from carbon- intensive fossil- fuel sources that have fuelled global economies for centuries. Hence,the need for profound changes to infrastructure, technologies, and behaviour to help reduce emissions. Failure to put these in place will escalate among others the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts on ecologies, that will threaten water security, livelihoods, agricultural production, and economic growth globally(OECD, 2013a; 2012).A prime example is the transition from a pre-industrial system built on water, traditional biomass, wind, and muscular ability to an industrial era marked by pervasive mechanisation, steam power, and coal (Grubler, 2012).This study aims to assess the shift in corporate strategy regarding factors arising due to the energy transition and how it is redefining corporate strategy. As stated, IOCs can't ignore energy transition, and corporate strategy is needed to adapt for future survival (Stevens, 2016). Copyright 2024, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",About Sufficiency

"Unlocking sustainable agricultural development in Africa via bio-nanofertilizer application - challenges, opportunities and prospects","A combination of rapid population growth, climate change, and environmental degradation have placed immense pressure on global food sources and increased food security concerns especially in developing economies like those of African countries. Notably, efforts to produce food for the rising human population have continued to burden arable lands across the globe, necessitating heavy use of chemical fertilizers to increase crop yield. While the widespread use of conventional fertilizers has indeed enhanced crop productivity, its sustainability is threatened by rapid soil degradation and rising environmental concerns resulting from chemical compound accumulation across several ecosystems. The invention of nanotechnology, which is the synthesis and manipulation of materials at the nanometer (1 to 100 nm) range, promises potential solutions to these agricultural sustainability challenges. Specifically, theoretical, and experimental research on nanofertilizers have highlighted significant potential for their employment in sustainable farming practices. The current review examines the benefits conferred by the delivery of nutrients to plants at the nanoscale, outlining the progress, challenges, and opportunities for adopting this emerging technology by African countries, and highlighting future perspectives and areas of possible collaborations globally. © 2024 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency
Toward a Sustainable and Equity Future: Navigating the Crossroads of Europe’s Energy Sector,"The year 2022 has been a difficult one for the European energy sector with high energy prices for the average consumer and an uncertain path forward. The European Union was forced to take measures for ensuring the energy security of the continent and accelerate the green transition with renewable energy sources widely regarded as the only way forward. European citizens, though concerned about climate change and the negative impact of fossil fuels, were forced to search for alternatives that would enable them to heat their homes during the winter and in consideration of the looming threat of blackouts and the uncertainties brought about by the war in Ukraine. The sustainable development of Europe’s energy sector and the transition away from fossil fuels is at the crossroads and the European Union seems determined to head down the path toward renewable and sustainable development. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities of sustainable development in the energy sector in Europe, with a focus on Romania. Climate change and the negative impact of the energy sector are highlighted, along with the need for a fair and just transition to clean energy. The European Green Deal, REPowerEU plan, Mechanism for a Just Transition, and Carbon Dioxide Emission Border Adjustment Mechanism are discussed as policies to promote sustainable development. The article emphasizes the need for effective public policies and the establishment of green jobs and technology in the industry to mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure a just transition to renewable energy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",About Sufficiency
From resources to resilience: Understanding the impact of standard of living and energy consumption on natural resource rent in Asia,"As Asia faces the dual challenges of rapid economic expansion and mounting environmental pressures, the region's ability to balance growth with sustainability has become a focal point of global discourse. With increasing energy demands, escalating CO₂ emissions, and widening income inequality, an integrated approach to managing natural resources has never been more critical. This study responds to this urgent need by examining the complex interplay between energy consumption, living standards, and natural resource rents—factors that will determine whether Asia can sustain its growth without depleting its ecological assets. Our analysis incorporates key variables such as standard of living, income inequality, renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption, CO₂ emissions, gross fixed capital formation, and foreign direct investment, all of which play crucial roles in shaping natural resource rents across Asian economies. Using Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR), we uncover nuanced insights into how these factors interact across different economic contexts. The findings reveal a negative correlation between higher living standards and resource rents, indicating that countries like Japan and South Korea, which have transitioned to more diversified, technology-driven sectors, demonstrate a pathway for sustainable growth. Conversely, economies like Indonesia and Malaysia, with lower living standards and higher dependence on resource rents, face challenges related to income inequality and environmental degradation. Renewable energy consumption positively impacts resource rents, while reliance on fossil fuels has a detrimental effect, reinforcing the need for energy portfolio diversification. A strong link between CO₂ emissions and resource rents highlights the necessity of balancing economic growth with environmental preservation. This study provides policymakers with actionable insights, emphasizing the importance of adopting sustainable energy practices, addressing income inequality, and managing foreign investments responsibly to ensure long-term resilience and prosperity in Asian economies while safeguarding vital natural resources for future generations. © 2024",About Sufficiency
Working in (Slow) Progress: Socio-Environmental and Economic Dynamics in the Forestry Sector and the Contribution to Sustainable Development in Europe,"Forest ecosystems are increasingly subject to disturbances, such as extreme (climate) events, fires and pathological outbreaks, which exert significant (and still poorly quantified) economic impacts, despite their intrinsic resilience. How forest management addresses these challenges will have profound effects on human health, environmental diversity, (ecological and economic) productivity and the ability of forest ecosystems to recovery from exogenous shocks. Assuming forests as ensuring ecosystem services that are vital to society and human well-being, in addition to providing wood material, a better knowledge of forest ecosystems appears a key requirement to delineate a developmental strategy that guarantees environmental protection objectives and achievement of climate and energy targets. In the context of Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the information available on forest management practices in Europe still seems not completely suitable to provide a comprehensive overview of ecosystem conditions, their economic value, and their biodiversity. Based on a literature review, the present contribution focuses on recent dynamics of the forestry sector in Europe, delineating the inherent complexity in the environmental-economic nexus. Additionally, the extensive use of a key natural resource such as wood exerts social implications for local districts adapting to ecological change—from climate warming to landscape transformations. In line with earlier studies, our paper confirms the role of the technical-economic dimension of forestry in sustainable development paths of districts and regions, affecting together (i) short-term economic dynamics, (ii) the growth prospects of the sector, (iii) the organization of the supply chain, (iv) the interconnections between companies, and (v) investment strategies at large. One of the major issues is the low reliability of official statistics to provide a coherent picture of the actual status of forest resources. At the same time, forestry practices are pivotal in maintaining habitats and species while increasing the timber production that remains (too) sustainable. This is the policy direction constantly given by the European Commission to stimulate over time public bodies and private (in whose hands is about 60% of European forests) to start virtuous paths in the circular economy with considerable repercussions in terms of additional jobs, recycled materials, mt of CO2 equivalent avoided, and increase in community added value. In this context, forestry should assure a more ‘holistic’ contribution to sustainable development paths at various spatial scales. This means concentrating on both economic and environmental targets based on the identification of significant (ecological-economic) dimensions that may delineate future lines of investigation and policy intervention, while increasing between member countries and regional authorities. © 2023 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE AND MEMBERS’ RESILIENCE IN KITA AND YANFOLILA CERCLES OF MALI,"The study examined the role of agricultural cooperatives in strengthening the resilience and social fabric of rural communities in the Kita and Yanfolila regions of Mali. Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, data was collected from 149 participants, including cooperative members and non-members, through structured surveys and focus group discussions. It explored the challenges faced by farmers, the benefits of cooperative membership, the dynamics of social cohesion within these cooperatives, the nuances of inclusion, and conducted a comparative analysis between cooperative members and non-members. The communities in Kita and Yanfolila faced multiple adversities that significantly affected their resilience, livelihoods and overall well-being. Drought emerged as the most serious problem, affecting the entire population and underscoring its profound impact on agriculture and welfare. Flooding was also a significant threat, exacerbating food insecurity. While terrorist activities and COVID-19 seemed less pressing due to their limited occurrence or awareness at the time, vigilance and awareness remained key. The study highlighted the myriad benefits of cooperative membership and how it empowered members through agricultural training, access to resources and financial stability. In particular, cooperatives have been instrumental in addressing water scarcity and ensuring sustainable access through initiatives such as boreholes and pumping equipment, thereby increasing agricultural productivity and food security. The study also highlighted the key role of cooperatives in fostering social cohesion, promoting conflict resolution and serving as networking platforms. Members praised cooperatives for providing emotional and material support in times of need, disseminating conflict management techniques and promoting transparent, collective decision-making processes. However, there was a noticeable gap in perceptions between cooperative members and non-members regarding the role of cooperatives in conflict resolution. Non-members were less confident, possibly due to a lack of exposure or understanding of cooperative mechanisms. Inclusivity emerged as a key issue, with discussions highlighting the challenge of extending benefits to nonmembers, which could lead to feelings of exclusion. Income disparities between members and non-members further exacerbated issues of social cohesion. The study also highlighted the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing disrupted supply chains, reduced incomes, increased unemployment and heightened food insecurity in rural communities. Despite this, agricultural cooperatives stepped up by disseminating information, distributing essential supplies and promoting hygiene practices. © (2024), All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
"Climate change, mountain food systems, and emerging opportunities: A study from the Hindu Kush Karakoram Pamir landscape, Pakistan","This study investigated the mountain food systems in the Hindu Kush Karakoram Pamir Landscape (HKPL) in Pakistan. It analyzed the impacts of climate change on agriculture and livestock and identified key opportunities which can be tapped into to improve sustainability in food systems. The study applied a “multiple case studies approach” and collected data from four study sites at different altitudes, using the method of slow focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and non-participant observation. Findings revealed that the contribution of local agriculture and livestock to people’s food consumption has gradually declined, increasing their dependence on external food items. Local food systems are losing diversity, which has negatively impacted people’s dietary diversity. The youth has lost interest in agriculture due to low productivity and profitability in a high altitude village—Misgar (≈3200 m above sea level). In all sites, local people perceived mixed impacts (both positive and negative) of climate change on food systems. Climate change together with enhanced use of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers, high yielding seed, and improved farm management have positive, and climate-attributed increase in crop pest attacks has negative impact on crop productivity. Moreover, local people perceived negative impacts of climate change on pastures and water availability in traditional irrigation systems without significant influence on crop and livestock productivity. In food systems, these are needed to maximize benefits from the local potential for organic production, livestock integration, value chain development, traditional food crops, medicinal plants, and protected vegetables cultivation to reduce the vulnerability of food systems to climactic and economic shocks, and improve the sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

Optimizing climate risk management practices: a hierarchical classification of TCFD risks in Taiwan’s electronics industry,"In the wake of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR6 report, there is escalating certainty regarding anthropogenic climate change and its concomitant uncertainties impacting corporate risk profiles and global financial stability. The lack of comprehensive climate risk identification contributes to this uncertainty. Despite its significance as a major global exporter, the Taiwanese electronics industry faces a significant empirical research gap regarding the corporate-level impacts of climate risks, resulting in an ambiguous risk landscape. Literature indicates that research related to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is still in its nascent stage, particularly in corporations’ strategic implementation of climate risk management. More climate risk identification is needed within this strategic domain to improve climate risk management. Based on the TCFD’s risk classification framework, we employed thematic analysis to identify 49 risk events within Taiwan’s electronics industry, thereby expanding the TCFD’s original list of risks and introducing a new category–climate risk events. Following this categorization, we applied the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to prioritize the materiality of these climate risk events. Subsequently, we incorporated vulnerability analysis to underscore its criticality in corporate climate risk management. This study highlights that acute physical risks, particularly power outages and water scarcity, dominate climate risk concerns within Taiwan’s electronics industry, whereas transition risks remain largely underestimated in corporate risk assessments. Furthermore, the findings reveal that vulnerability, measured through disclosure gaps, has a limited yet notable impact on risk prioritization, underscoring the need for more transparent and standardized climate risk reporting. By integrating hierarchical classification, materiality assessment, and vulnerability analysis, this study provides empirical evidence to support Taiwanese policymakers and industry practitioners in refining climate risk disclosure frameworks and strengthening corporate resilience strategies. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",About Sufficiency

"Integrated assessment for Sustainable Development Goals of metropolitan regions: A case study of the Pearl River Delta region, China","Achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the sub-national scale requires contextual insights and localized implementation. This study utilizes Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to assess SDG progress and interactions in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) metropolitan region of China. Population growth, economic development, and rapid urbanization are key drivers, exerting pressures on energy and water consumption, pollutant discharges, transportation, environmental degradation, and disaster management. The results reveal varied progress in nine goals intrinsic to this metropolitan context, with notable progress in energy and water consumption, and employment (Goals 7, 8, and 3). While moderate progress is evidenced in poverty reduction, economic growth, healthcare services, social security, access to potable water, water quality (Goals 1 and 6), challenges remain in transportation, waste generation, air quality, forest management, and disaster response (Goals 9, 11, and 15). Furthermore, target interaction analysis suggests that initiatives in high-leverage areas - ecosystem and environmental protection, equal access to resources and basic services, and climate change response - can yield substantial systemic impacts. However, poverty reduction, access to resources and basic services, ecosystem protection, and economic growth appear more dependent on system-wide efforts. By leveraging the DPSIR model, this context-sensitive SDG assessment accentuates priority zones and offers valuable perspective for cohesive SDG strategy formation and policy-making in dynamically growing metropolitan areas globally. © 2023",About Sufficiency
Assessing the sustainability of China's coastal regions: A perspective on local coupling and telecoupling,"The transboundary flow of resource elements has resulted in unprecedented transfers of environmental and social impacts, inevitably influencing a region's environmental carrying capacity and sustainability. Consequently, evaluating the effects of both internal and external resource elements on regional sustainability is crucial for advancing sustainable development. This study distinguishes between internal and external resource elements that support the development of China's coastal areas, based on local coupling and telecoupling theories. It employs the emergy analysis method to assess the degree of dependence of these coastal areas on external resource elements, as well as the environmental loading pressures resulting from both internal and external resource elements and evaluates the sustainability of China's coastal regions. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of environmental load pressure were analyzed using the Local Indicators of Spatial Association time path, while the driving forces affecting sustainability were examined through the Logarithmic Mean Divis Index method. The results indicate that social development in China's coastal areas increasingly relies on external resource elements. In Hebei, Liaoning, and Shandong, the environmental load pressure primarily arises from the utilization of internal resources, whereas in Tianjin and Shanghai, it mainly stems from external resources. Overall, the sustainability of China's coastal areas is trending downward. Enhancing emergy intensity, promoting sustainable resource use, and reducing reliance on imported resources can contribute to improved sustainability. Finally, several actionable suggestions are provided. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Can digital literacy promote farmers’ cultivated land quality protection behaviors?,"Cultivated land is the most valuable agricultural resource and the most important factor of production. The protection of cultivated land quality is not only the foundation of national food security but also a strategic issue related to the sustainable development of the economy and society as a whole. This paper uses survey data from Jiangxi Province’s “Double Hundred and Thousand” in 2023 and empirically analyzes the impact of digital literacy on farmers’ cultivated land quality protection behaviors and its mechanism by using the O-probit model and the mediating effect model. The results show that digital literacy can effectively promote farmers’ cultivated land quality protection behaviors. Furthermore, digital literacy can indirectly promote farmers’ cultivated land quality protection behaviors through cultivated land protection cognition and digital use ability. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that farmers are more inclined to participate in cultivated quality protection behaviors In the context of better soil fertility conditions and higher digital literacy. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously improve the digital literacy of farmers, improve their awareness of cultivated land protection, and continuously strengthen their digital use ability. © 2025 Shuang Hu, Huogen Wang.

Circular economy: A review of review articles,"The circular economy (CE) has emerged as a focal point in discussions surrounding sustainable development, industrial production, and resource efficiency. While it has garnered attention as a ground-breaking paradigm with the potential to harmonize economic, societal, and environmental dynamics, divergent perspectives and critical inquiries have surfaced. This paper delves into the interdisciplinary literature on CE, exploring the interpretative flexibility inherent in its conceptualization. Acknowledging the diverse range of strategies associated with the CE, the study contends with the potential risks of its misappropriation, emphasizing the importance of understanding its systemic socio-ecological implications. With an umbrella review approach, rarely applied in social sciences, the study navigates through 167 review articles, unveiling thematic trends and identifying gaps within the existing literature. By scrutinizing the techno-managerial dominance within CE discussions, the paper calls attention to the overshadowing of numerous critical issues. It highlights the importance of systematic attention to CE's social aspects, essential to provide insights into how policies, strategies, and actions affect the society, as well as the emerging discussion on the alternative social transformative paradigm. The paper concludes with a three-stage study design: a meticulous review of 167 articles, a thematic analysis revealing trends, and a reflective exploration of potential research avenues.

"The Economics of a ""portion size reduction"" policy","This study develops novel models of heterogeneous consumer preferences for different dining options and imperfect competition among food suppliers to analyze the market and welfare effects of portion size reduction (PSR) for food away from home. Different scenarios on the nature of differentiation of the dining options, the information available to consumers, and their response to links between portion size and obesity, food waste, and climate change are considered within this framework. The market and welfare effects of the policy are quantified using a simulation analysis. The analysis shows that the market and welfare effects of the policy are case-specific and dependent on the relative magnitude of the cost and utility effects of PSR, the strength of the consumer preference for dining out, and the food suppliers' initial costs and degree of market power in the relevant markets. The policy can create winners and losers among consumers and accounting for consumer heterogeneity, as done in this study, is essential for capturing the asymmetric welfare effects of PSR. Intriguingly, consumers and suppliers can benefit from PSR even without accounting for any health or/and environmental benefits of reduced portion sizes. © 2022 Hosni, Giannakas.

The political economy of negative emissions technologies: consequences for international policy design,"Negative emissions technologies (NETs), especially bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and direct air capture and storage, have been invoked as necessary to achieve the aspirational 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement. However, currently their costs are estimated to be very high, NETs do not seem to offer co-benefits besides mitigating climate change and there are significant concerns regarding possible negative impacts of their large-scale implementation on sustainable development. Costs can vary significantly due to locational factors such as availability of biomass resources and geological storage capacity. It will be up to progressive industrialized countries to take first steps to mobilize the mitigation potential of NETs. In order to understand whether NETs can provide a significant contribution to mitigation, financial incentives are needed that allow implementing the most attractive NET activities at the global scale. We see the market mechanism under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement–colloquially called ‘Sustainable Development Mechanism’–as a possible cornerstone of such a policy instrument. While initially NETs will not be competitive on the free market, the mechanism can facilitate bilateral financial transfers for NETs, where mitigation units accrue to the financier. We discuss the functions and design elements that an international policy instrument may need to fulfil to successfully mobilize NETs. This includes in particular robust quantification of removed carbon under international oversight and preventing social and environmental conflicts particularly on land and water use by NETs to ensure long-term acceptability. Key policy insights International policy instruments that mobilize negative emissions technologies are inexistent despite most mitigation pathways relying on large-scale NETs implementation later this century. Feasibility of NETs at large-scale is highly uncertain due to high expected costs and political economy challenges. Practical experience is necessary for better understanding feasibility. For cost-effective global deployment of NETs, a policy instrument would need to mobilize international financial flows and implement safeguards concerning sustainable development impacts. The sustainable development mechanism established in Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement could be a good basis for this if it includes a robust approach to evaluating sustainable development impacts building on the sustainable development goals. © 2017 The Author(s).

Global impacts of energy demand on the freshwater resources of nations,"The growing geographic disconnect between consumption of goods, the extraction and processing of resources, and the environmental impacts associated with production activities makes it crucial to factor global trade into sustainability assessments. Using an empirically validated environmentally extended global trade model, we examine the relationship between two key resources underpinning economies and human well-being-energy and freshwater. A comparison of three energy sectors (petroleum, gas, and electricity) reveals that freshwater consumption associated with gas and electricity production is largely confined within the territorial boundaries where demand originates. This finding contrasts with petroleum, which exhibits a varying ratio of territorial to international freshwater consumption, depending on the origin of demand. For example, although the United States and China have similar demand associated with the petroleum sector, international freshwater consumption is three times higher for the former than the latter. Based on mapping patterns of freshwater consumption associated with energy sectors at subnational scales, our analysis also reveals concordance between pressure on freshwater resources associated with energy production and freshwater scarcity in a number of river basins globally. These energy-driven pressures on freshwater resources in areas distant from the origin of energy demand complicate the design of policy to ensure security of fresh water and energy supply. Although much of the debate around energy is focused on greenhouse gas emissions, our findings highlight the need to consider the full range of consequences of energy production when designing policy.",About Sufficiency
Sustainable development: Our Common Future revisited,"No clear definition of sustainable development exists to guide politicians in solving challenges at the global or regional levels.

We also define indicators and threshold values for each of these dimensions; in addition, we show how 167 countries compare in meeting these threshold values. Currently, no country meets all four thresholds. Even so, we propose that, with the use of technology and behavioural changes, it will be possible to reach the threshold values by 2030. © 2014 The Authors.",About Sufficiency

Australian Wild Rice Populations: A Key Resource for Global Food Security,"Rice is one of the most important food crops contributing to the diet of large numbers of people especially in Asia. Rice (Oryza sativa) was domesticated in Asia many thousands of years ago and more recently independently in Africa. Wild rice populations are found around the tropical world. The extensive production of rice in many areas has displaced the wild populations that were the basis of the original domestications by humans. Recent research, reviewed here, has identified wild rice species in northern Australia that have been isolated from the impact of domestication in Asia. Wild rice populations contain novel alleles that are a source of desirable traits such as erect habit, disease resistance, large grain size, and unique starch properties. These populations include the most divergent genotypes within the primary gene pool of rice and more distant wild relatives. Genome sequencing also suggests the presence of populations that are close relatives of domesticated rice. Hybrid populations that demonstrate mechanisms of ongoing evolution of wild Oryza have been identified in the wild. These populations provide options for both new domestications and utilization of novel alleles to improve or adapt domesticated rice using conventional or preferably new breeding technologies. Climate change and growing food demands associated with population and economic growth are major challenges for agriculture including rice production. The availability of diverse genetic resources to support crop adaptation and new crop domestication is critical to continued production, and increased efforts to support in situ and ex situ conservation of wild Oryza and related species are warranted. © Copyright © 2019 Henry.",About Sufficiency
"Poverty and biodiversity trade-offs in rural development: A case study for Pujiang county, China","Both, poverty reduction and preservation of biodiversity are high on the global agenda on sustainable development. The relationships between poverty, biodiversity of agro-ecosystems and agricultural development are complex and poorly understood. In this paper, we present an integrated framework for analysis of agricultural development and natural resource management options at agro-ecosystem level, using Pujiang county, in Zhejiang province, China as a case study area to perform the analysis. A regional linear programming (LP) model is applied, maximizing regional economic surplus, given production and labour market conditions in Pujiang. We use the model to examine the consequences for a set of regional poverty and biodiversity indicators, of four so-called poverty reduction strategies, i.e., (i) intensification of production, (ii) diversification towards livestock production, (iii) land expansion, and (iv) an exit from agriculture. The analysis indicates that diversification is the most promising poverty reduction strategy, but requires efficient use of animal manure in cropping systems to avoid environmental problems. Improved nutrient management in cropping systems is effective in reducing the regional nitrogen surplus, but less effective in increasing per capita income. The exit strategy is effective in reducing poverty and achieving biodiversity goals, but may have important social consequences that are not addressed in this study. Further reduction in rural poverty is hampered by labour constraints during the harvesting period in high value crops such as vegetables and fruits, which calls for research and development in the field of agricultural mechanization. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Unequal access to resources undermines global sustainability,"Within a global society there exist various land use patterns, inequality, and the movement of people and goods. The various practices and behaviours associated with our current society raise questions about the future sustainability of the human population and the natural environment. We derive a simplified model of the global socio-ecological system in an effort to explore the connections between human well-being and land resources, specifically looking at resource accessibility, conservation initiatives and human migration between two economically diverse regions. We find that the spatial aspect of a global system with two distinct regions allows for faster development of technology, higher peaks in population size, greater natural land degradation, and generally speaking lower population well-being in the long-term. The unequal access to resources and differences in technological progress, alter the outcome of land management (i.e., conservation) and social behaviours (i.e., migration). We conclude that any socio-ecological management practices should be conscientious of the diversity in land access, population size, population well-being and development within the global society, as the potential for unintended consequences is high. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Chapter 68 An Assessment of the Impact of Agricultural Research in South Asia Since the Green Revolution,"The post-Green Revolution period has seen profound changes in the economic situation in South Asia and evolving challenges for the agricultural R&D system. The priorities have changed from a narrow focus on the productivity of food grains to a need for more work on natural resources management and sustainability issues; increasing the productivity and quality of high-value crops, trees, and livestock; agricultural intensification in many less favored areas; more precise targeting of the problems of the poor, including enhancing the micronutrient content of food staples; and analysis of policy and institutional options for achieving more sustainable and pro-poor outcomes in the rural sector. This study draws on the available literature to assess how successful the agricultural R&D system has been in achieving these new goals in South Asia. Overall, it finds that the R&D system has responded well to these changing needs in terms of both budgetary allocations and the kinds of research that has been undertaken. Moreover, market liberalization has enabled a more diverse set of agents to engage in agricultural R&D, and private firms and NGOs have helped ensure that important research and extension needs have not been overlooked. Findings on the impact of this evolving research agenda are mixed. The economic returns to crop improvement research have remained high and well in excess of national discount rates. Public investments in crop improvement research have also given higher returns than most other public investments in rural areas. There is little credible evidence to suggest that these rates of return are declining over time. Agricultural R&D has also made important contributions to reducing poverty in South Asia, but it has done less well in reducing interhousehold and interregional inequities. The greatest impact on poverty has been obtained by lowering food prices, but this pathway might be less important in the future now that food prices are aligned more with border prices and food accounts for a smaller share of consumers' budgets. Also, given that agriculture now plays a relatively small part in the livelihoods of many marginal farmers in South Asia, questions arise about the efficacy of continuing to target agricultural R&D to their problems. Agricultural R&D has also been successful in addressing many of the environmental problems associated with agriculture, with a demonstrated potential for favorable impacts in farmers' fields. Yet the uptake of improved technologies and management practices that reduce environmental damage has been disappointing, particularly in intensively farmed areas. Finally, a large amount of policy research has been undertaken in South Asia since the GR, and case studies show favorable returns to policy research, though the conditions under which it leads to policy change are not well understood.

"DETERMINANTS OF CROP CHOICE IN NORTH SHEWA, ETHIOPIA: A FRACTIONAL MULTINOMIAL APPROACH","Rapid population growth and climate change remain challenges of addressing food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Improving productivity and commercialization of smallholder famers are recognized as effective strategies in addressing food security and sustainable agriculture. Crop choice is a tool for efficient utilization of land, stabilizing food prices and creating a balanced food system. Despite the presence of national agricultural output growth in Ethiopia in recent years, there is widespread concern that the contribution of agricultural output to gross domestic product is below its potential. To find ways to increase smallholders’ crop production and productivity and achieve food security, this study investigated factors determining crop choice in North Shewa Ethiopia. A total of 392 farmers were selected using a Multi-stage random sampling technique. A schedule interview using questionnaire was used to collect cross-sectional data from smallholder farmers, while focus group discussions were organized to supplement the quantitative analysis. Results from descriptive statistics revealed that major sources of income were crop production activities. Findings also revealed that households had acquired land through redistribution and purchasing. The study also revealed that market-associated problems including transportation, weak land contractual enforcements, and inadecquacy of wage laborers during harvesting negatively affect farm income. The study found sorghum, teff, onion and mungbean as dominant crops covering 95 % of the total cultivated land. The finding also indicated that land allocation for each crop is interdependent between crop types and between households through their socio-economic facts. The Fractional multinomial model indicates that market distance and irrigation use were found to influence all four crop shares. The analysis also predicts the association of each variable with each crop share in the form of average marginal effects. The key policy implication is that optimal crop choice and sustainable crop production could easily be achieved through market related mechanisms like insurance and contractual farming. © 2023, African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development.

Sufficiency as relations of enoughness,"An expanding body of literature discusses the importance of sufficiency for sustainable development. However, conceptual vagueness stands in the way of the practical application of sufficiency as a sustainability strategy. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the concept of relations of enoughness, building on the general notion of ‘enough’, which is prevalent in sufficiency literature. Relations of enoughness will be explained based on the widespread use of sufficiency advocating for changes and reductions of individual consumption with the goal to reduce environmental impacts such as carbon dioxide emissions. Diverse uses and understandings of sufficiency can be united in a shared structure of ‘enough/too much/too little of X regarding Y’. Relations of enoughness can be connected to sustainability by expanding them into chains of enoughness, which serve as a conceptual foundation for the sustainable consumption corridor approach. Finally, the premises of sufficiency and potential for further research are discussed. © 2024 The Author(s).

Framework development for ‘just transition’ in coal producing jurisdictions,"The rhetoric of the ‘just transition’ lies at the heart of energy and development policies internationally. In this context, it is crucial that communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction and production for employment do not become ‘victims’ of the decarbonisation process. This paper involves a theoretically and conceptually grounded comparative analysis of policy measures that have been introduced in three first world jurisdictions which have been dependent on coal for employment – North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, Alberta in Canada and Victoria in Australia. In so doing, measures which have successfully ameliorated the socio-economic well-being of coal dependent communities are identified and a framework for successful just transition is proposed. Recognising, but notwithstanding, inherent power dynamics, the framework identifies an important role for government in assisting workers and communities in navigating the transition process and in supporting new and emerging low-carbon industries in the context of ‘strong’ sustainable development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Adaptations in irrigated agriculture in the Mediterranean region: an overview and spatial analysis of implemented strategies,"In order to meet future food demand while sustainably managing available land and water resources, irrigated agriculture in semi-arid regions needs to adapt as a response to climate and socio-economic change. In this study, we focus on the Mediterranean region, a dynamic region, which is highly dependent on irrigated agriculture. We provide insight on adaptation strategies implemented on farm level, by doing a systematic review of studies in the region. Our analysis reports 286 implemented adaptations, on 124 different locations throughout the Mediterranean. Additionally, 142 drivers and 324 effects of adaptations were noted. We identified 31 adaptation strategies in 5 main categories: (1) water management, (2) sustainable resource management, (3) technological developments, (4) farm production practices, and (5) farm management. Strategies in the categories water management and farm production practices are most often implemented by farmers in the region. The main driver in the area is water scarcity and adaptations often affected water use and resources in addition to farm practices. Subsequently, we studied the spatial context of adaptations by analyzing the location factors of the five main strategies, using Geographic Information Systems and maximum entropy modeling. Our results show that farmers are more likely to adapt in less rural areas with lower poverty values and better market access, and in areas with higher temperatures and less rainfall. This demonstrates that both biophysical and socio-economic factors determine the context in which adaptations are implemented and that considerable spatial variability in the area exists. © 2019, The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
Inclusive innovation and green growth in advanced economies,"As the global economy faces the dual challenges of social inequality and environmental degradation, the concepts of inclusive innovation and green growth emerge as critical pathways for sustainable development. Inclusive innovation seeks to democratize access to technology and opportunities, while green growth promotes economic progress with reduced environmental impact. This study explores the relationship between inclusive innovation and green growth by examining how the Global Innovation Index (an indicator for inclusive innovation) affects the carbon intensity of GDP (a measure of green growth). Using an endogenous growth model across 35 Advanced Economies, we employ panel techniques for long-term, quantile, and causality analyses. Our findings reveal that inclusive innovation fosters green growth in the long term, effectively reduces emissions in countries with high innovation adoption, and exhibits robust bidirectional causality between the two. This underscores that inclusive innovation drives not only social equality but also environmental sustainability. © 2025 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency
Natural resources accounting: A tool for water resources management in Botswana,"Natural Resource Accounting (NRA) has become an important environmental/natural resources management tool in recent years. It provides information on stocks of a resource available at a particular point in time and what activities the resource is being used for. The conventional System of National Income Accounts (SNA) normally does not capture the cost of depletion, degradation or pollution of natural resources. This encourages unsustainable use of natural resources since the costs are not reflected when assessing the country's economic performance or development progress. NRA is thus an attempt to integrate environmental issues into the conventional national accounts. The water sector is one sector that could greatly benefit from this natural resource management tool. Botswana has adopted NRA as a natural resource management tool and has so far developed accounts for minerals, livestock and water. The focus of this paper is on Water Accounting (WA) in relation to Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). IWRM is concerned with coordinated development and management of water in order to maximise economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of ecosystems. WA helps fill data gaps since it provides the required information for IWRM to be achieved. The aim of this paper therefore is to evaluate the Water Accounts of Botswana Report of 2006 to determine the extent to which it can contribute to integrated water resources management. The paper is based on literature review and the results show that: the available water stocks vary depending on rainfall patterns, well fields are over utilised, there has been growth in consumption, and more than 80% of the waste water produced is not being put to use. These results calls for changes in policies, role of institutions and practices pertaining to water resources management which is what IWRM is all about hence the paper concludes that indeed WA can contribute to the realisation of IWRM. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Innovations in capture fisheries are an imperative for nutrition security in the developing world,"This article examines two strands of discourse on wild capture fisheries; one that focuses on resource sustainability and environmental impacts, another related to food and nutrition security and human well-being. Available data and research show that, for countries most dependent on fish to meet the nutritional requirements of their population, wild capture fisheries remain the dominant supplier. Although, contrary to popular narratives, the sustainability of these fisheries is not always and everywhere in crisis, securing their sustainability is essential and requires considerable effort across a broad spectrum of fishery systems. An impediment to achieving this is that the current research and policy discourses on environmental sustainability of fisheries and food security remain only loosely and superficially linked. Overcoming this requires adoption of a broader sustainability science paradigm to help harness synergies and negotiate tradeoffs between food security, resource conservation, and macroeconomic development goals. The way society chooses to govern fisheries is, however, an ethical choice, not just a technical one, and we recommend adding an ethical dimension to sustainability science as applied to fisheries.",About Sufficiency

Management of environment, food security and poverty alleviation are the primary factors contributing to the complexity of natural resource management, which is very important for achieving sustainable development goals. The rural poor depend on agriculture or are otherwise dependent on natural resources for their basic life support systems. The livelihood and well-being of rural and urban people depend fundamentally on the opportunities available to them, and these opportunities are shaped substantially by their access to resources, which in turn depends on numerous underlying political, social and macro-economic factors, those are transforming with the current trends of globalization, migration, market integration, democratization and decentralization. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",About Sufficiency
Socioeconomic impacts of a sea cucumber fishery in Papua New Guinea: Is there an opportunity for mariculture?,"Small-scale fisheries provide many benefits to coastal communities in the Indo-Pacific region, including food security, improved nutrition and cash income. However, increasing engagement with the global economy is exerting additional pressure on marine resources and opportunities to engage in alternative livelihoods are often limited by remoteness and a lack of land-based farming opportunities. Bêche-de-mer, the dried body wall of sea cucumber, is a valuable marine export commodity in the region, and an important cash-earning activity in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Sea cucumber mariculture (or holothuriculture), based on the high-value species, sandfish (Holothuria scabra), is also a promising community livelihood. Overfishing of sea cucumber in PNG led the National Fisheries Authority (NFA) to impose a moratorium on the fishery in October 2009. The fishery was reopened in 2017 for less than two months. This article presents socioeconomic data generated before, during and after the 2017 sea cucumber fishing season in three villages in New Ireland Province, PNG, which are also partners in a community-based sandfish mariculture project. The fishery dominated the economies of all three communities while it was open. Increased income was accompanied by high consumption of store-bought foods and purchase of other assets intended to increase living standards. Drawing on current understandings of local culture and political economy, together with the results from the 2017 wild sea cucumber fishery, we discuss how a livelihood based on holothuriculture could coexist with the wild fishery to increase benefits to coastal communities in PNG. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
"Sustainable development and sustainable forestry: Analogies, differences, and the role of flexibility","Various approaches have been developed to achieve sustainability in forestry, under changing social needs and, consequently, changing definitions of sustainability. This has led to the confusing situation in which various groups have different understandings of the meaning of 'sustainability'. Likewise, the concepts utilized to achieve sustainability, often with a poorly defined objective, are sometimes not clear and/or inconsistent as a systematic overview regarding definitions and concepts is lacking. Based on a literature review, this paper discusses related terms such as sustainability, sustained yield management, sustainable forestry, sustainable forest management and sustainable development: their history, concepts and relationships, from a European perspective. Finally, flexibility is proposed as a solution to overcome the identified shortcomings at all scales, while focussing on the enterprise level. The origin of the sustainability concept in forestry was first driven by forest experts, while participatory elements have been considered since the more recent idea of sustainable development. Since then, much effort has been made to achieve intragenerational fairness by creating an improved participatory process. Concurrently, the original idea of sustainable forestry as long-term and future-oriented management, considering future generations' needs fell behind. An increasing standing timber volume in Europe and the discussion on climate change brought new interest in how to cope with risks in the context of pervasive future uncertainties within the scope of promoting sustainable development. Although the consideration of risk has been concentrated on as a topic in forest science in recent years, studies have mainly focused on the enhancement of forest resistance against disturbances. However, precaution and risk avoidance alone are probably insufficient to achieve an improved sustainable development that focuses on intergenerational fairness, as these more defensive approaches may disregard important management opportunities involved with an uncertain future. A perhaps more promising approach, the idea of future options and the ability to respond to changing social and biophysical circumstances (i.e. flexibility) as criteria for sustainable development have only shown a shadowy existence up to now. To further develop the consistency of sustainability concepts, a shift of sustainability approaches from continuity towards flexibility options is proposed. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",About Sufficiency
"Sustainability assessment for indirect potable reuse: A case study from reno, Nevada","A triple bottom line (TBL) approach was used to examine the trade-offs between potential reclaimed water management strategies in a closed basin. The goals of the water management strategy included minimizing water source shortages, ensuring safe and resilient future water supplies, and protecting inland ecosystems through adequate surface flows. The TBL approach consisted of quantitative and qualitative impact assessments of social, environmental, and economic criteria. This research examined how potable reuse of reclaimed water addresses water needs in a closed basin such as maintaining water quality, managing reclaimed water disposal, meeting growing water demand, balancing groundwater extraction rates with inflows, preserving inland ecosystems, and ensuring a locally controlled safe drinking water source. The TBL assessment first evaluated water stress based on water demand and supply under status quo conditions. The results were compared with the potable reuse scenario, which provides more environmental and social benefits than the status quo scenario. Water Environ.

A Review of Consumer Perspectives on Green Apparel,"The rapid expansion of human activities, particularly after industrialization, created significant environmental and social challenges. Depletion of natural resource, climate change, population growth, and unsustainable consumption practices have all resulted in significant environmental damage around the world. The rising environmental impacts are due to excessive water usage in textile manufacturing, contamination from processing chemicals, and the amount of waste generated during disposal. In a world where social and environmental issues are becoming increasingly important, the fashion industry is in dire need to lessen and monitor its environmental and social impact. Amidst several innovative approaches to contribute to sustainable growth, many apparel manufacturers and designers are now providing clothing options labelled green textiles to consumers. Green clothing is also being produced to reduce the waste of natural resources like water, plants, energy, and land. Furthermore, Indians are becoming more interested in green or organic clothing brands which will most likely contribute to the apparel sector’s revenues. The current study reviews the concept of green apparel, consumers’ awareness of green fashion, the drivers that impact their purchase decision and choices, and the common dilemma of consumers’ preferences for green products. It will emphasize the importance of understanding barriers to more sustainable production and consumption systems. Consumers can be educated about environmentally friendly attributes and benefits, resulting in a favorable understanding of green apparel benefits and value. Thus, the proposed work would lead to policy making as retailers and manufacturers can benefit through more focused strategies for environmental safety to reduce non-green branded products while educating their consumers about green apparel. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.",About Sufficiency
Groundwater Depletion Embedded in Domestic Transfers and International Exports of the United States,"The United States plays a key role in global food security by producing and exporting agricultural products. Groundwater irrigation is increasingly important in agricultural production, nearly tripling since records began in 1950. Increased reliance on groundwater and prolonged unsustainable pumping of aquifers has led to groundwater depletion in many areas. In this study, we ask: How much groundwater depletion is embedded in the domestic transfers and international agricultural exports of the United States? How much do domestic and international agricultural commodity fluxes rely on unsustainable groundwater use? To address these questions, we quantify the amount of nonrenewable groundwater that is incorporated into agricultural commodities produced in the United States and transferred both within the country and exported internationally. We find that 26.3 km (Formula presented.) of nonrenewable groundwater was transferred domestically in 2002 and 2.7 km (Formula presented.) was sent abroad. In 2012, 34.8 km (Formula presented.) was transferred domestically and 3.7 km (Formula presented.) was exported. This indicates an increase of 32% in domestic transfers and 38% in international exports. In 2002, we find that 1,491,126 kt (340 billion USD) of agricultural products reliant on nonrenewable groundwater were domestically transferred, while 119,048 kt (47 billion USD) were exported. In 2012, the mass transfer of agricultural goods reliant on unsustainable groundwater decreased, but their value in national and international supply chains increased by 54% and 31%, respectively. Our results underscore the importance of the long-term risks posed to global agricultural supply chains from reliance on unsustainable groundwater use. © 2020. American Geophysical Union.

Sustainable agriculture for environment protection: Cooperation between China and Italy,"After a short introduction on the importance of the agro-food sector in the economies of most of present-day societies, the article focuses on the role of agriculture in protecting the environment and enhancing biodiversity. The importance of a shift toward agricultural systems, which are more complex in terms of biodiversity in emerging countries such as China, where most of the population (about 70%) lives in rural areas, in poor conditions and still relies on agriculture as the main source of income is discussed. In China the risk of shifting to more intensive and polluting agricultural production patterns to address the demand for food of the growing population and the need of higher incomes of rural communities is relatively high. With the present Chinese economic growth, urbanization and increased leisure time, tourism and recreation activities in rural areas are also increasing. Additionally, in the restructuring process of economy in rural areas, one of the most obvious effects is the necessity to create job opportunities alternative to agricultural sector. The role of sustainable agriculture for environment protection in a country such as China is highlighted. The attention paid to activities in the agro-environmental sector has been increasing over the years in this country due to the high social and economic priority attached by the Chinese authorities to the modernization of agriculture that must be pursued in a sustainable manner, addressing at once food security, environment protection, economic development and good management of natural resources. The experience gained in the framework of the Sino-Italian Cooperation Programme for Environment Protection jointly launched by the Italian Ministry for the Environment and Territory (IMET) and the State Environment Protection Administration of China (SEPA) in the year 2000, through the implementation of several cooperation projects in different rural areas of China is critically discussed. The approached adopted, avoiding pursuing short-term objectives, due to the pressure for profit, to ensure the replicability and long-term sustainability of transferred technologies are described. Important in all cooperation projects carried out have been training and information activities to enable the actual transfer into practice of target sustainable agricultural technologies and practices. All stakeholders have been involved in project preparation and implementation. Particularly, academic institutions, public research centers and private companies have been partnered with the aim of creating long lasting network of local and international researchers and experts supporting the development and the adaptation of sustainable farming systems as well as the design of new regulatory framework supporting the adoption of innovative technologies. District workshop and seminar have been organized in order to keep people involved in project activities continuously aware of all progress as well as to inform stakeholders on scientific, technical and economic feasibility of upcoming new techniques and systems.

The Three Domains structure of energy-climate transitions,"This paper argues that the development of energy systems rests on a combination of three different domains of socio-economic processes and associated modes of decision-making. For shorthand these are termed 'satisficing', 'optimising', and 'transforming' domains, with corresponding underpinnings found in behavioural, neoclassical, and evolutionary economics respectively. Each domain operates at different scales of time and personal/organisational/societal decision-making, and explains different characteristics of how energy systems develop. At least since the industrial revolution, the nature of energy systems has depended on government policy, and each domain implies a need for different policy instruments; the combination of all three lays the foundations for far more coherent, effective, and mutually reinforcing policies, including those required to transform energy systems in the light of environmental constraints. The approach also provides a coherent theoretical framework for understanding the conditions under which co-benefits and 'green growth' may emerge from environmental policy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",About Sufficiency
Durum wheat productivity today and tomorrow: A review of influencing factors and climate change effects,"Durum wheat is a crucial staple crop in many arid and semi-arid regions around the world, significantly contributing to local food security. This review paper aims to explore the current status of durum wheat productivity and the potential impacts of future climatic conditions on its cultivation. Various drivers and constraints affecting durum wheat yield are examined, including biotic and abiotic stressors, CO2 concentrations and agronomic practices. Drought and heat stress were identified as the primary yield limiting factors. Furthermore, the influence of climate change on durum wheat is evaluated, focusing on altered precipitation patterns, temperature extremes, and increased atmospheric CO2 levels. Most prominent quantification methods for climate change impact on yields are explored. The paper provides a summary of the current state of research, which reveals some contradictory results for future durum wheat yields. On the one hand, significant increases in productivity due to the fertilization effect of higher CO2 levels are predicted. On the other hand, the crop failures are foreseen as consequence of elevated heat and drought stress as part of climate change. Overall, this paper underlines the importance of understanding the complex interactions between climate change and durum wheat productivity and highlights the urgency to explore sustainable adaptation strategies to ensure future food security. © 2024 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency

Economic Measures of Sustainability,"Sustainable Agriculture is a term that has grown out of global call for sustainable development. Unfortunately, the term has been very widely adopted to represent a variety of initiatives. If the term is to retain any meaning it must be refined and defined. In this paper sustainability was defined as: The maintenance of the net benefits agriculture provides to society for present and future generations. This definition is very much a humanist approach, which includes both consumer and producer surplus. The paper identifies the conflict that may occur between consumer surplus, producer surplus and total economic surplus. From a consumer surplus point of view food security, and discounting are major issues. The compensating variation of a famine may be infinite making food security a primary goal of many nations. The maximization of the net returns from agricultural production represents me producer surplus point view. A second, somewhat related concern is the maintenance of minimum level of income in the agricultural sector. Consumer surplus is threatened by food scarcity, and agricultural income is threatened by surpluses. Price is the best measure we have of scarcity. To discuss sufficiency in the absence of price is very misleading. Similarly, describing sustainability in terms of expected output and prices is also misleading. It is unplanned scarcity and abundance that threatens food security and economic viability respectively. It is therefore, the ability of the agricultural system to respond and rule out extreme price that is central to the issue of sustainability. Given the inelastic nature of the demand the ability for sustainable agriculture may largely be a function of the elasticity of supply. The ability of fixed factors such as land to enter and exit a sector may also augment sustainability. A thirdsource, of economic flexibility is alternative technologies that can be applied at very low or high prices. This flexibility has to be valued not at expected prices but rather for the option values at extreme prices. Government has a role in sustainability. Governments should pursue policies which enhance the elasticity of supply. Policies that stabilize income through prices have the opposite effect. These programs should at a minimum be decoupled. Secondly, governments should spend research dollars on technologies that enhance the elasticity of supply. Finally, land set aside programs, add great deal to the elasticity of supply. © 1991 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society",About Sufficiency
Building an equitable green economy: a Brazilian perspective,"The transition from a carbon-driven economy to a green-driven economy demands a paradigm shift in institutions and change in infrastructure. This paper examines the Brazilian quest for a green and equitable economy. Brazil's green liabilities range from a carbon-intensive transportation matrix to a poorly developed social infrastructure. Yet, Brazil offers one of the world's most biodiverse landscapes, a large reservoir of fresh water and the world's largest tropical forest. Using a 'politics of attention' perspective, we propose that it is precisely the mobility of the Brazilian economy that precludes its evolution as a vanguard of change. Its rising status as a part of the global economic agenda makes it accept globalization without making an effective paradigm shift toward the environment and social justice. A transition to a green economy cannot be achieved using management practices that drive a carbon-intensive economy. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",About Sufficiency
"COVID-19, sustainable development challenges of Latin America and the Caribbean, and the potential engines for an SDGs-based recovery","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region and to discuss imperative engines for potential regional recovery. Design/methodology/approach: This study conceptually discusses the effects of COVID-19 on the LAC region and highlights potential areas for recovery. Findings: The LAC region have a history of facing structural development challenges – due to digital inequality, environmental degradation, erosion of democracy and financial debt – which have led to a profound discontent among people in the LAC region and this dissatisfaction has been intensified by the crises stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. LAC region can increase its resilience and recover its path to sustainable development by consolidating impact-based regional value chains, attracting sustainability-themed foreign direct investment and nurturing structural development to facilitate LAC companies to expand into international markets (“multilatinas”). Research limitations/implications: There are some preliminary studies on the economic and social impact of COVID-19 on the LAC region, however, the strategies that emerging and developing economies might pursue to promptly recover are still a matter of discussion. The uncertainty and heterogeneity of the developing and emerging economies and the multidimensional needed actions require local adaptations and adjustments. Originality/value: The LAC COVID-19 crisis recovery requires shared responsibility, global solidarity, urgent and immediate cooperation and structural transformations to enable deeper regional integration. This integration should focus on impact-based value chains to be resiliently adaptable to changing global realities and arduous local contexts.

Inland fisheries and the four pillars of food security in Sub-Saharan Africa: Assessing current research trends,"Inland small-scale fisheries provide important ecosystem services in sub-Saharan Africa as a source of nutritious food to over 200 million people and offer avenues for countries to attain Sustainable Development Goal 2. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on the pathways of fish to food security, especially in the case of inland small-scale fisheries, which are often underrepresented in research and policy discussions. We review the literature from 2010 to the present to assess how fish food systems, specifically those associated with inland small-scale fisheries in sub-Saharan Africa, relate to the four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability, as well as women's empowerment. We offer an assessment of the extent to which each of these pillars of food security has been thoroughly conceptualized and investigated in the literature, identifying important avenues for future research. Overfishing, post-harvest losses, and trade influences drive fish availability in many contexts. Income benefits from participating in small-scale fisheries were important for attaining access to fish for food security and other important livelihood outcomes. Few studies addressed utilization and stability compared to availability and access pillars. Further, few studies examined how gender shapes outcomes of women's empowerment.

Are biofuels an effective and viable energy strategy for industrialized societies? A reasoned overview of potentials and limits,"In this paper, I analyze the constraints that limit biomass from becoming an alternative, sustainable and efficient energy source, at least in relation to the current metabolism of developed countries. In order to be termed sustainable, the use of an energy source should be technically feasible, economically affordable and environmentally and socially viable, considering society as a whole. Above all, it should meet society's ""metabolic needs,"" a fundamental issue that is overlooked in the mainstream biofuels narrative. The EROI (Energy Return on Investment) of biofuels reaches a few units, while the EROI of fossil fuels is 20-30 or higher and has a power density (W/m2) thousands of times higher than the best biofuels, such as sugarcane in Brazil. When metabolic approaches are used it becomes clear that biomass cannot represent an energy carrier able to meet the metabolism of industrialized societies. For our industrial society to rely on ""sustainable biofuels"" for an important fraction of its energy, most of the agricultural and non-agricultural land would need to be used for crops, and at the same time a radical cut to our pattern of energy consumption would need to be implemented, whilst also achieving a significant population reduction. © 2015 by the authors.",About Sufficiency
Is a richer-but-warmer world better than poorer-but-cooler worlds?,"Greater economic growth could lead to greater greenhouse gas emissions, while simultaneously enhancing various aspects of human well-being and the capacity to adapt to climate change. This begs the question as to whether and, if so, for how long would a richer-but-warmer world be better for well-being than poorer-but-cooler worlds. To shed light on this issue, this paper draws upon results of the ""Fast Track"" assessment (FTA) reported in a special issue of Global Environmental Change: Part A 14 (1): 1-99 (2004), which employed the IPCC's emissions scenarios to project future climate change and its global impacts on various determinbts of human and environmental well-being. Results suggest that notwithstanding climate change, through much of this century, human well-being is likely to be highest in the richest-but-warmest (A1FI) world and lower in poorer-but-cooler worlds. With respect to environmental well-being, matters may be best under the A1FI world for some critical environmental indicators through 2085-2100, but not necessarily for others. An alternative analysis using the Stem Review's worst-case results for potential welfare losses due to climate change indicates that welfare, adjusted for market and non-market impacts of climate change and the risk of catastrophe, should be highest under the A1FI scenario, at least through 2100.",About Sufficiency
Food security: The challenge of feeding 9 billion people,"Continuing population and consumption growth will mean that the global demand for food will increase for at least another 40 years. Growing competition for land, water, and energy, in addition to the overexploitation of fisheries, will affect our ability to produce food, as will the urgent requirement to reduce the impact of the food system on the environment. The effects of climate change are a further threat. But the world can produce more food and can ensure that it is used more efficiently and equitably. A multifaceted and linked global strategy is needed to ensure sustainable and equitable food security, different components of which are explored here. © 2010 American Association for the Advancement for Science.

Agrivoltaic system: Experimental analysis for enhancing land productivity and revenue of farmers,"Energy and food security is alarmed by the influences of climate change, population, and world economic growth. In this perspective, the co-located agrivoltaic system, a nexus of photovoltaic and agriculture production, is more suitable to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of a country like India. An experimental investigation has been conducted at CUTM, Odisha through a portable and adjustable agrivoltaic system of 0.675 kWp capacity in 11 m2 of land area to study the enhancement of land productivity and revenue of farmers or/and investors. This system provides an underneath farming of 1.5 kg turmeric as a shadow tolerant medicinal crop. Major performance indicators of the project such as land equivalent ratio, benefit-cost ratio, price-performance ratio, and payback period have been found as 1.73, 1.71, 0.79, and 9.49 years respectively. Further, the temperature level is decreased by 1–1.5 °C resulting in the improvement of the energy generation in the system and successfully tested in dual DC micro-grid solutions having two 12 V 75 Ah solar tubular batteries. This work can be extended to different scales of agrivoltaic systems with suitable crops in th farmers' land, as they are the end-users of this co-located system. © 2022 International Energy Initiative",About Sufficiency
Equitable infrastructure: Achieving resilient systems and restorative justice through policy and research innovation,"Recent major investments in infrastructure in the United States and globally present a crucial opportunity to embed equity within the heart of resilient infrastructure decision-making. Yet there is a notable absence of frameworks within the engineering and scientific fields for integrating equity into planning, design, and maintenance of infrastructure. Additionally, whole-of-government approaches to infrastructure, including the Justice40 Initiative, mimic elements of process management that support exploitative rather than exploratory innovation. These and other policies risk creating innovation traps that limit analytical and engineering advances necessary to prioritize equity in decision-making, identification and disruption of mechanisms that cause or contribute to inequities, and remediation of historic harms. Here, we propose a three-tiered framework toward equitable and resilient infrastructure through restorative justice, incremental policy innovation, and exploratory research innovation. This framework aims to ensure equitable access and benefits of infrastructure, minimize risk disparities, and embrace restorative justice to repair historical and systemic inequities. We outline incremental policy innovation and exploratory research action items to address and mitigate risk disparities, emphasizing the need for community-engaged research and the development of equity metrics. Among other action items, we recommend a certification system—referred to as Social, Environmental, and Economic Development (SEED)—to train infrastructure engineers and planners and ensure attentiveness to gaps that exist within and dynamically interact across each tier of the proposed framework. Through the framework and proposed actions, we advocate for a transformative vision for equitable infrastructure that emphasizes the interconnectedness of social, environmental, and technical dimensions in infrastructure planning, design, and maintenance. © The Author(s) 2024.",About Sufficiency
Defining and conceptualising the commercial determinants of health,"Although commercial entities can contribute positively to health and society there is growing evidence that the products and practices of some commercial actors—notably the largest transnational corporations—are responsible for escalating rates of avoidable ill health, planetary damage, and social and health inequity; these problems are increasingly referred to as the commercial determinants of health. The climate emergency, the non-communicable disease epidemic, and that just four industry sectors (ie, tobacco, ultra-processed food, fossil fuel, and alcohol) already account for at least a third of global deaths illustrate the scale and huge economic cost of the problem. This paper, the first in a Series on the commercial determinants of health, explains how the shift towards market fundamentalism and increasingly powerful transnational corporations has created a pathological system in which commercial actors are increasingly enabled to cause harm and externalise the costs of doing so. Consequently, as harms to human and planetary health increase, commercial sector wealth and power increase, whereas the countervailing forces having to meet these costs (notably individuals, governments, and civil society organisations) become correspondingly impoverished and disempowered or captured by commercial interests. This power imbalance leads to policy inertia; although many policy solutions are available, they are not being implemented. Health harms are escalating, leaving health-care systems increasingly unable to cope. Governments can and must act to improve, rather than continue to threaten, the wellbeing of future generations, development, and economic growth. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Water resource decoupling in the MENA through food trade as a mechanism for circumventing national water scarcity,"This paper explores the trends driving the growing demand for food imports to the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region through the lens of ‘decoupling’. The analysis deploys a water-specific model of the general idea of resource decoupling to analyse the role and potential of food and virtual water trade in alleviating national and regional water limits. Decoupling theorises the breaking of the link between economic and population growth and need for water demand for domestic food production. A key means of reducing pressure on scarce water resources of a growing population is to increase the proportion of food sourced from abroad. This strategy has been strongly embraced politically in a number of MENA economies facing a combination of water and labour shortage. Food imports provide a politically silent mechanism to achieve national food security, and generate significant markets for food-exporting, water abundant, economies including those in the tropics. This paper combines FAO Food Balance data with Water Footprint data to reveal how virtual water flows interact with food import tonnages to enhance or retard national decoupling based on food trade. The analysis reveals that much MENA water is directed at crops adapted to the MENA climate. However, the analysis reveals significant potential for the import of large quantities of MENA water needs from more water abundant countries through supply of staple crops. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.",About Sufficiency
Does environmental regulation dividends inequality impact inclusive growth? Evidence from China,"Based on the panel data of 281 city level in China for the period of 2004–2016, this study uses the Cobb–Douglas production function to investigate the distribution of environmental regulation dividends and further adopts the threshold model to explore the impact of environmental regulation dividends inequality (ERDI) on inclusive growth (IG). Results indicate that the distribution structure of the environmental regulation dividends has improved, but the inequality between urban–rural residents is still apparent. Environmental regulation dividends inequality has a non-linear threshold effect on inclusive growth, which turns from a significant inhibition to a slight promotion after exceeding the threshold value. Grouping tests show that environmental regulation dividends inequality has a heterogeneous effect on cities with different resource endowments and leading industries and still inhibits inclusive growth of non-resource-based cities even if the inequality is higher than the threshold value. Mechanism analysis reveals that primary distribution and redistribution are the main channels through which environmental regulation dividends inequality inhibits and promotes inclusive growth when the inequality is below and above the threshold value, respectively. These conclusions have important implications for enhancing and distributing environmental regulation dividends to promote inclusive growth.

Challenges to SDG 2 on Zero Hunger: Becoming aware of the Vulnerabilities of the Global Food System,"This chapter critically examines the challenges hindering the effective implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) – Zero Hunger, by focusing on two systemic vulnerabilities of the global food system: the surpassing of planetary boundaries and its fossil fuels dependence. More concretely, it analyses the interconnectedness of these challenges and their impact on the sustainability of food production, distribution, and access. By raising awareness of these vulnerabilities, this research seeks to reflect upon the multifaceted obstacles that must be addressed to realise the vision of a world without hunger, such as the dominant productivist narrative. In this sense, it advocates for a comprehensive approach to tackle the root causes of food insecurity and emphasises the need for transformative policies that foster resilience and inclusivity in global food systems. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Lucía Morales, Bernadette Andreosso-O’Callaghan and Daniel Rajmil; individual chapters, the contributors.",About Sufficiency
Methodology to assess sustainable indicators for a socially responsible company in the polymers manufacturing sector,"The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology to assess the sustainable indicators for a socially responsible company operating in the chemical industry sector and to evaluate those indicators within a specific chemical industry facility that manufactures polymers. When drafting this document the challenge to face was how Mexican companies labeled as Socially Responsible Companies, could be sustainable, considering the Triple Bottom Line of sustainability: social, environmental and economic as well as achieving the Principle of Sustainable Development: to meet actual needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own. The guiding method of this research was a qualitative analysis of different tools, with a pragmatic approach gained due to professional experience in the chemical industry sector. In general, conditions in the Mexican manufacturing sector are not optimal considering that most petrochemical products, including fuels, are imported; being this energy supply key to keep manufacturing facilities operational. A review of the economic theory that underlies social management and sustainable development was included. The financial results of the private companies as their most important objective, as well as the environmental care and community welfare are government accountability; both are supported in the neoclassical economic theory, though this is not justified from an economics of natural resources point of view. Modern economy encompasses several theories regarding the environment: circular economy, economy, economy of natural resources and environmental taxes were very useful as a framework of public policies implemented in Mexico. One of our major concerns relates to green taxes. Due to our eroded economic conditions any type of tax, including environmental taxes, is carefully considered by the Government in order not to affect competitiveness with Mexican companies. As soon as the Climate Change Bill was enacted in 2012, green taxes were levied on carbon and fossil fuels in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions; unfortunately, it is expected to get significant results in a longer time. Even the Energy Transition Law enacted in 2015 offered the opportunity to create new sources of renewable energy, but it is evident that the petrochemical industry holds a significant role in the Mexican energy market. The persistence of intergovernmental conflicts such as the rivalries between federal and provincial environmental governments, as well as costly bureaucratic structures, resulted in a poor performance in the environmental regulation. Under these circumstances, the private industry, specifically the chemical industry, must strive to work efficiently to avoid any environmental impact, even regulation does not include any specific action. The chemical sector represents industries where preventive pollution practices are well recognized, although they are not a priority. Indicators are the only way to monitor environmental performance. The methodology designed considered the identification of indicators in each and every one of the stages, according to the Intersection Circles Model. Due the broad scope of the themes, this work deepens the search for economic-environmental indicators; and under a shorter scope, the environmental-social indicators. The methodology describes the way to find indicators in each one of the three stages: (a) individual: those aligned to the legal compliment; (b) sustainable development indicators: interrelated indicators, those addressed in the intersection of two circles. These indicators are: social-economic, environmental-economic and socialenvironmental; (c) the last stage referred to are the sustainable indicators (those aligned to the sustainable development principle) and addressed in the intersection of three circles. Sustainable indicators were defined with the contribution of a specialized resins chemical company (polymers manufacturer). The results obtained in the first stage made clear that the indicators documented by companies are based solely on legal requirements, and are in no way related to social or environmental impacts. Conclusions included further lines of investigation. In regards to the government, to monitor sustainable indicators that should be reported from the industry; this information could be an input to design public environmental policies in order to contribute to the growth of Mexican economy. In regards to the academy, to work closely with government and private sectors in order to make applied investigations. Finally, in regards to the industry, to implement a Socially Responsible Model within their strategies and pursue the objectives proposed. An interrelation among these three groups to participate as a team was a reiterated recommendation. Lastly, we consider that this research will offer important contributions to companies that have a social responsibility, by supplying a methodology, which will enable them: (a) to identify stakeholders with whom the company has social responsibilities; (b) to identify the potential social, environmental and economic impacts to the stakeholders and prevent them; and (c) to include the Socially Responsible Model proposed, in order to render economic benefits by means of socially responsible practices. © Serials Publications Pvt.

Detecting and understanding co-benefits generated in tackling climate change and environmental degradation in China,"China is facing the challenge of climate change and environmental protection in line with the promotion of sustainable development goals. Climate, environmental, and economic policy can each individually impact the effectiveness of other policies in the process of implementation. Understanding synergies among policy measures and identifying the co-benefits of environmental sustainable development generated by them is the focus of the paper. Because of existing restrictions in current research methods, the research community lacks the capacity to detect the interrelation among environmental, economic, and social development. Co-benefit research has gradually become an important area on sustainable development. Based on endogenous economic growth theory, we build a modified endogenous growth model to determine the optimal rates of economic growth, environmental pollution, energy input, and other factors in the context of co-benefits. Further empirical analysis is given which is missing in previous studies in this field. The empirical analysis reveals that China’s actual GDP, consumption, energy input, and physical capital growth rates are much higher than the optimal growth rate. However, the human capital and environmental pollution control growth rates are slower than the optimal values. Although China has a rapid growth in economy, the optimal level of comprehensive co-benefits has not been reached yet. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",About Sufficiency
Standards and social welfare in Cournot oligopolies,"This paper ranks two widely used command-and-control environmental instruments, in terms of relevant equilibrium variables such as output, profits, consumer surplus and social welfare. Specifically, we consider n symmetric and polluting firms that compete in quantity, have access to an exogenous cleaning technology (that cannot be modified by the firms) and are subject to environmental regulation by means of either emission or performance standards. We consider a one-stage game, where the instruments are exogenously fixed in such a way that pollution coincides for both regimes. In this game, the performance standard dominates in terms of output and consumer surplus, but the firms prefer the emission standard. In terms of social welfare, the performance standard may dominate the emission standard when the number of firms is limited, which contrasts with the case of perfect competition, where the emission standard is welfare-superior. These results on social welfare prevail when we introduce a previous stage where the environmental authority optimally chooses the instrument by maximizing social welfare, that is, when we endogenize the policies. © 2020, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",About Sufficiency
Feed conversion efficiency in aquaculture: Do we measure it correctly?,"Globally, demand for food animal products is rising. At the same time, we face mounting, related pressures including limited natural resources, negative environmental externalities, climate disruption, and population growth. Governments and other stakeholders are seeking strategies to boost food production efficiency and food system resiliency, and aquaculture (farmed seafood) is commonly viewed as having a major role in improving global food security based on longstanding measures of animal production efficiency. The most widely used measurement is called the 'feed conversion ratio' (FCR), which is the weight of feed administered over the lifetime of an animal divided by weight gained. By this measure, fed aquaculture and chickens are similarly efficient at converting feed into animal biomass, and both are more efficient compared to pigs and cattle. FCR does not account for differences in feed content, edible portion of an animal, or nutritional quality of the final product. Given these limitations, we searched the literature for alternative efficiency measures and identified 'nutrient retention', which can be used to compare protein and calories in feed (inputs) and edible portions of animals (outputs). Protein and calorie retention have not been calculated for most aquaculture species. Focusing on commercial production, we collected data on feed composition, feed conversion ratios, edible portions (i.e. yield), and nutritional content of edible flesh for nine aquatic and three terrestrial farmed animal species. We estimate that 19% of protein and 10% of calories in feed for aquatic species are ultimately made available in the human food supply, with significant variation between species. Comparing all terrestrial and aquatic animals in the study, chickens are most efficient using these measures, followed by Atlantic salmon. Despite lower FCRs in aquaculture, protein and calorie retention for aquaculture production is comparable to livestock production. This is, in part, due to farmed fish and shrimp requiring higher levels of protein and calories in feed compared to chickens, pigs, and cattle. Strategies to address global food security should consider these alternative efficiency measures. © 2018 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.",About Sufficiency
The Economic and Welfare Effects of Food Waste Reduction on a Food-Production-Driven Rural Region,"Food waste is economically and ecologically unsustainable; the benefits of food waste reduction are indisputable. Yet knowledge of the economic trade-offs and knock-on effects of such reduction is deficient. This study examines the economic effects of food waste reduction in a rural region that is a nationally important producer of agricultural and food products in Finland. We built a detailed social accounting matrix to trace the transactions among the economic agents. Five different simulations of food waste reduction were run by applying a computable general equilibrium model. In the simulations, households and food services halved their food waste. The results indicated that food waste reduction is economically worthwhile in terms of regional investments and gross domestic product at market prices. However, the reduction induced economic trade-offs and welfare redistribution. The value added to the agriculture and food industries and the welfare of agricultural households decreased, albeit that the simulated compensations alleviated the effects. In the long run, falling agricultural wages and factor incomes entail closedowns and, finally, decrease local food production. This aspect is worth considering in terms of policy planning under the principle of just transition of the European Green Deal. © 2022 by the authors.

Food stocks and grain reserves: evaluating whether storing food creates resilient food systems,"Many are worried that the global food system is entering a period of intense volatility driven by a combination of climate change and population growth. One way to address this problem is for governments and the international community to store more food as a buffer against crisis. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of food storage as a component of a robust food security strategy in the twenty-first century. We do this by first drawing on historical examples from ancient Rome and China, where preindustrial government designed extensive systems that ensured adequate food storage to keep food systems stable. Next, we review the links between food storage and price volatility in the last 20 years and demonstrate that the size of food stores (and in particular grain reserves) directly relates to price volatility. Third, we explore three different types of policies designed to promote grain reserves, the US’s “ever-normal granary” policy, the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, and the Strategic Grain Reserve in Africa. In this third section, we show how there has been a decline from state-owned strategic grain reserves in favor of a more market-oriented approach that is dominated by a handful of powerful corporations who maintain sophisticated supply chains. Because data on the amount of food supply these corporations hold in storage are proprietary secrets, it is impossible to assess how resilient or vulnerable this makes our food system. Finally, we conclude that over time, food storage has fallen in and out of favor, criticized for being expensive yet often shown to play an important role in protecting poor consumers in times of food crisis. Given the lack of data on current levels of supply chain and household storage, more research is needed to evaluate the scale at which food storage systems should be implemented to ensure food system resilience as well as the most effective mechanisms to govern and manage them. © 2015, AESS.",About Sufficiency
How to regenerate rural community and ecoservices: Reversing the tragedy of the commons,"Rural areas in the United States are losing people, communities and ecosystem services due to outmigration of population, and loss of small, biodiverse farms. One large driving force is consolidation of farmlands into larger production units and consequent loss of biodiversity in areas within and adjacent to production fields. This century-long trend has accelerated in the past decade due to high commodity prices and introduction of labor-saving technologies such as transgenic crops and larger machinery. Federal farm support programs and favorable economic conditions for farm expansion have also contributed to the trend. Research on technologies that are more accessible to large operations and aggressive input marketing practices further stimulate consolidation. In spite of apparent efficiencies and economic power of an industrial agricultural system, all is not positive. There is growing societal concern that current trends are leading to a tragedy of the commons. Issues relating to where and how food is grown, trade-offs between production of food vs. fuel, and distribution of benefits from agriculture when economic and political power are concentrated are being debated. Growing public interest in food safety, nutrition, food security, and healthy environments adds to discourse about the present structure of agriculture. A growing segment of society envisions national food and farming policies that would help restore small and medium-sized family farms and rural communities, and to enhance ecosystem services provided by bio-diverse rural landscapes-in essence, reversing the current tragedy of the commons by pursuing a more equitable and sustainable farming and food system. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

Evaluation of water footprint for table olive groves of Olea europaea L. 'Konservolea',"As agriculture appears to be globally the greatest water user and water scarcity, due to fresh water shortages or deterioration of fresh water quality, is listed among the major global risks, efficient use of water resources is closely linked to sustainable agricultural practices. Water footprint (WF) has been largely employed during the last decade as a useful tool for planning efficient water management strategies at global, national, regional or even water basin level. WF is an indicator that is based on methods and tools that calculate the amount of water used along the full supply chain of a product. 'Konservolea' is a local table olive cultivar assigned as a protected geographical indication (PGI) product of Arta, Greece. It is the main table olive cultivar in the area, it has a significant impact on local economy and it exhibits favorable economic and market prospects. In this study the WF of 'Konservolea' was calculated based on actual data from four olive groves and the results are presented and discussed. All four groves were conventionally treated according to the local practices regarding pruning, fertilisation, plant protection, etc. Three of the olive groves were irrigated, while the fourth was rainfed. The WF of the four olive groves ranged from 354 to 961 m3 t-1 of olive fruit. The results provide a first yet solid assessment of the WF of table olive crop in the area and underline the effect of different agronomic practices on WF. Practical difficulties regarding the calculation of WF that need to be further investigated and resolved are pointed out. © 2022 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Local actors’ perspectives on sustainable food value chains: evidence from a Q-methodology study in Kenya,"Governments and international organizations are increasingly determined to create more sustainable food value chains (SFVCs). However, only little empirical evidence is available on how SFVCs are understood. Enquiring African food value chain actors allows gathering valuable insights into their perception of sustainability, which characteristics of sustainable food value chains they prioritize, and which obstacles to a sustainable transformation they identify. By means of a Q-methodology involving interviews with 33 Kenyan respondents, four perspectives were distinguished. The first perspective, “economic productivity and growth,” prioritizes economic growth and has only limited attention to the social dimension of sustainability. The second perspective, “food security and food availability,” believes that ensuring food security should be the key goal of SFVCs. The third perspective, “environment first,” is dedicated to the environmental dimension of sustainability; the perspective implies that protecting natural resources is the primary way to sustain this level of production. The fourth perspective, “transformative knowledge,” entails that by innovating and sharing knowledge, food value chains can become more sustainable in different areas. Overall, this study provides reliable insights into how Kenyan food value chain actors perceive sustainability in their sector and which elements they believe should be prioritized when rethinking food systems. The study results are valuable for policy-making to further define an SFVC in Kenya and to pave the way for a sustainable transformation of the food sector in developing countries. © 2023, AESS.",About Sufficiency
Steps toward a resilient circular economy in India,"Abstract: Developing nations, including India, face a number of daunting challenges in the twenty-first century, including population growth, political strife, rapid urbanization, food and water scarcity, environmental pollution, infectious diseases, and climate change. In this turbulent era, there is a need for resilience at every level—from the village family to the corporate boardroom to the halls of government. We argue that achieving resilience will require both enlightened government policies and successful initiatives by social and environmental innovators that demonstrate the capacity for adapting to these challenges. Such practical first steps can serve as models for creating a more resilient and sustainable economy in India. One way to stimulate rapid progress is development of circular economy solutions that create innovative pathways for utilization of discarded materials, thus seeking to eliminate waste. Previous research has shown that such initiatives reduce environmental pressures and improve community resilience, while stimulating the regional economy. An international conference on Waste Management Innovation, held in 2017 in Mumbai with funding from the US Consulate General, resulted in the award of seed grants to two Indian non-profits that sought to apply circular economy principles to regional communities—one urban and one rural. These initiatives provide case studies of circular economy implementation. The World Institute of Sustainable Energy has developed an action plan to capture at least 60 percent of the electronic waste generated in the city of Pune, one of the largest metropolitan areas in India. Their approach is based on circular economy principles, and has been embraced in stakeholder meetings with city officials as well as local residents and non-governmental organizations. Barefoot College has established and demonstrated a low-cost, end-to-end solid waste management model for rural villages that is designed by the local community. Their unique approach ensures sanitation, environmental protection, income and livelihood generation, and drives behavioral change in village residents by motivating them to maintain community hygiene. This paper presents the results of these two efforts, and suggests what lessons were learned. One overarching insight is that an integrated systems view is necessary to understand the interplay of economic, environmental, and social forces.

The challenge of implementing macroeconomic policy in an increasingly microeconomic world,"""How did I get here?"" (Byrne and Eno. Once in a lifetime-Talking Heads song (Album). Sire Records, Philadelphia, PA; 1980). The problem with development and implementation of large-scale policy into small communities is foundational to the basic conflict in an economics-driven soci- ety. That is, economic growth normally depletes resources and reduces ecosystem services leading to negative environmental externalities that, in turn, impacts social welfare. But national policy still places economic growth as a leading indicator of societal success, even if success is achieved to the detriment of the global scarcity of resources, contributing to child mortality, obesity, lack of access to clean water, unsafe communities, uncertain citizenship status, and similar concerns. All these negative environmental conditions crucially influence health conditions, whatever undeveloped, emerging, or industrialized country is considered. Reconciling the differences in this multidimensional political, social, economic, behavioral, life sci- ence, and public health dilemma is tricky, at best, due to governing models reliant on a foundation of economics, history, and mathematics-a triple bane of every scholar's existence. However, the opportunity to generate progressive and sustain- able change absent this foundation would otherwise be missed. Thus, this chapter introduces and then unfolds the economic problem in contrast to human develop- ment that is at the root of the challenge of implementing national economic policy and the local impact effecting general human development and quality of life. The chapter addresses the application of new metrics supporting economic, human and sustainable development and closes with the application of these metrics towards reasonable constraints of national equitable distribution and global economic expansion. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

Economic Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture: Case of Africa,"The agricultural sector is of utmost importance for the expansion of African countries as it represents the main pillar of their economies. The problem though is the changing climatic conditions which can negatively impact on agricultural output and as a result these countries will be affected on both economic and social grounds. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between climate change and agriculture for the case of 20 African countries from 1995 to 2017. The results show a negative and significant relationship between temperature and agricultural output for the selected African countries. Further analysis of the results shows that human capital development contributes positively to the growth of the agricultural sector, while trade openness is observed to prevent its expansion. Hence, there is a need for better land management, governance, and irrigation systems, use of appropriate fertilizers as well as better infrastructure to boost agricultural yields and counter the negative impacts of climate change. Farmers’ education, use of information technology, and mechanization are also needed. Appropriate policies will help the African agricultural sector to become more productive and in the long term to ensure food security in the region. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Impact of fossil fuel transition and population expansion on economic growth,"The existing works in endogenous growth have focused on technology and rarely on population impacts. In contrast, the research on environmental degradation caused by fossil fuel utilization has relied mostly on exogenous technology and population growth. Building upon the previous literature, I propose a dynamic growth model that allows the interaction between an economy and energy consumption of renewable and nonrenewable and the transitional path from one to another. I also allow endogenous population growth, where the population is affected by living standards and industrialization and indirectly natural resources through production, considering the trade-off between nonrenewable energy reserves and renewable resources. By creating a feedback loop from the population to the level of industrialization and GDP in this setup, GDP per capita’s growth rate is lower under endogenous population scenario relative to exogenous population growth. This particular outcome conveys that many projections for future energy use might overestimate our energy use, hence the economic and environmental costs. Firms utilize nonrenewable energy more intensively in a decentralized model since they do not fully internalize the negative externalities that arise from using nonrenewable energy, unlike the social planner approach. Imposing carbon-tax elements on the energy producers’ profit would accelerate clean energy adaptation and sustain the fossil fuel resources for a more extended period while increasing the total welfare by 3%. It would also increase the individuals’ long-term total consumption. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",About Sufficiency
"Political Commitment to resource management, the African case","Natural resources' importance in economic and social development has been a recurring theme in development and policy debate. While existing research on the 'resource curse' is inconclusive, many studies show that resource-rich countries have poor economic growth and development outcomes. Many of these studies, however, treat development outcomes as a byproduct of good resource governance, rather than investigating the relationship between resource governance and social impact or development outcomes. The primary goal of this research is to look into the relationship between political commitment and a variety of dimensions, including economic diversification, resource governance, fiscal sustainability, and social impact in resource-rich countries, with a focus on Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The study aims to address the lack of research and policy attention paid to the role of political commitment in mitigating the resource curse with a data span from 1980–2018. The study is motivated by the little research and policy attention to the role of political commitment in addressing the 'resource curse'.The findings show that the majority of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries in the study have low or very low levels of government commitment, as measured by the Natural Resource Political Commitment Index (NRPCI). Furthermore, the findings indicate that natural resource governance is complex; for example, Botswana has a high NRPCI score but a low social impact score, indicating that the benefits of the natural resource have not been felt in the lives of their citizens. This finding is still relevant in terms of policy implications. The index could be a useful tool in policymakers' hands as they attempt to address the multifaceted challenges that natural resource abundance developing and emerging countries face, as well as bring new perspectives to the natural resource curse research agenda. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",About Sufficiency
Climate change and food security: a Sri Lankan perspective,"There is growing concern in Sri Lanka over the impact of climate change, variability and extreme weather events on food production, food security and livelihoods. The link between climate change and food security has been mostly explored in relation to impacts on crop production or food availability aspects of food security, with little focus on other key dimensions, namely food access and food utilization. This review, based on available literature, adopted a food system approach to gain a wider perspective on food security issues in Sri Lanka. It points to several climate-induced issues posing challenges for food security. These issues include declining agriculture productivity, food loss along supply chains, low livelihood resilience of the rural poor and prevalence of high levels of undernourishment and child malnutrition. Our review suggests that achieving food security necessitates action beyond building climate resilient food production systems to a holistic approach that is able to ensure climate resilience of the entire food system while addressing nutritional concerns arising from impacts of climate change. Therefore, there is a pressing need to work towards a climate-smart agriculture system that will address all dimensions of food security. With the exception of productivity of a few crop species, our review demonstrates the dearth of research into climate change impacts on Sri Lanka’s food system. Further research is required to understand how changes in climate may affect other components of the food system including productivity of a wider range of food crops, livestock and fisheries, and shed light on the causal pathways of climate-induced nutritional insecurity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",About Sufficiency
Conceptualizing food systems for global environmental change research,"This paper outlines a framework for studying the multiple interactions of broadly defined food systems with global environmental change and evaluating the major societal outcomes affected by these interactions: food security, ecosystem services and social welfare. In building the framework the paper explores and synthesizes disparate literature on food systems food security and global environmental change, bridging social science and natural science perspectives. This collected evidence justifies a representation of food systems, which can be used to identify key processes and determinants of food security in a given place or time, particularly the impacts of environmental change. It also enables analysis of the feedbacks from food system outcomes to drivers of environmental and social change, as well as tradeoffs among the food system outcomes themselves. In food systems these tradeoffs are often between different scales or levels of decision-making or management, so solutions to manage them must be context-specific. With sufficient empirical evidence, the framework could be used to build a database of typologies of food system interactions useful for different management or analytical purposes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Linking natural resources and environmental sustainability: A panel data approach based on the load capacity curve hypothesis,"Economic development accelerated by natural resource use has caused many undesirable environmental consequences such as reducing the living standards of individuals and threatening human health. Therefore, whether natural resource abundance is a curse for individuals' welfare and environmental sustainability is one of the crucial topics in the literature. This study investigates the impact of natural resources on environmental sustainability by adopting the newly developed Load Capacity Curve hypothesis in the resource-rich Sub-Saharan African countries for the period from 1990 to 2020 by utilizing a set of panel data methods. The main estimation results can be outlined as follows: (i) cointegration tests show the existence of the long-run relationship between variables, (ii) the Load Capacity Curve Hypothesis is valid in the model, and (iii) natural resource rent, energy consumption, and population density reduce environmental sustainability, (iv) empirical estimations for robustness check greatly confirm the finding obtained by baseline estimations. Therefore, policy-makers in the resource-rich Sub-Saharan African countries should focus on establishing mechanisms for internalizing negative externalities of natural resource rent. © 2023 The Authors.

Sustainable land systems in the Anthropocene: Navigating the global land squeeze,"Rapidly progressing climate heating as well as ongoing economic and population growth exacerbate the challenges of reconciling the multitude of land functions and services. Terrestrial ecosystems support biodiversity and climate regulation and deliver resources like food, energy, or fiber, while infrastructures proliferate. Navigating the resulting “global land squeeze” aims to maintain a healthy biosphere while supporting land-based services for a decent living for us all. To elucidate trade-offs and synergies related to the global land squeeze, we discuss key components of the land system and their interplay, trade-offs, past trends, and current geographical patterns. We examine three social-science concepts and explore their suitability for navigating the land squeeze and identify demand-side strategies, like reducing overconsumption, that may emerge as no-regret solutions in industrialized contexts. We conclude that enhancing the analytical capabilities to steer land system change requires shifting from isolated driver-impact analyses toward the ex ante integration of societal and ecological sustainability targets on an equal footing. © 2024 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency
"Food security, fisheries and ocean acidification: A human rights based approach","The ocean is a major food source for the 7.7 billion people on Earth yet not widely and effectively recognized in global food systems. The ocean is threatened by the impacts of climate change, in particular ocean acidification, jeopardizing food security of coastal populations. The ocean has absorbed approximately 30 per cent of emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide, changing ocean chemistry and leading to ocean acidification. The potential consequences of ocean acidification on marine bivalves have been largely overlooked. This chapter emphasizes the role of the ocean as a provider of nutrition and an important source for fulfilling the human right to food for many, and highlights the risks created by the adverse impact of ocean acidification on food security and sustainable ocean management. The chapter will first examine generally the overlooked role of the ocean for food security and the right to food. Second, it will look at the international legal framework related to the protection of the ocean and fisheries as well as the climate change legal framework. This will be presented in three distinct but relevant areas: (i) protection of the ocean and fisheries, (ii) climate change, environment and sustainable development, and (iii) international human rights mechanisms, specifically the right to food. The aim is to establish a synergy among those areas for better legal protection of the ocean against ocean acidification and a human rights-based approach to food security. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2021.",About Sufficiency
Case for Climate Smart Agriculture in Addressing the Threat of Climate Change,"Climate smart agriculture (CSA) embodies a blend of innovations, practices, systems, and investment programmes that are used to mitigate against the adverse effects of climate change and variability on agriculture for sustained food production. Food crop production under various climate change scenarios requires the use of improved technologies that are called climate smart agriculture to ensure increased productivity under adverse conditions of increased global temperatures, frequent and more intense storms, floods and drought stresses. This chapter summarizes available information on climate change and climate smart agriculture technologies. It is important to evaluate each climate change scenario and provide technologies that farmers, research scientists, and policy drivers can use to create the desired climate smart agriculture given the array of tools and resources available. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Jason Holt and Marc Ramsay.",About Sufficiency
Impact of climate change on arid lands agriculture,"The planet earth, on which we live in communities, is being increasingly 'ruptured' because of human activities; its carrying capacity is under great stress because of demographic pressures. The pressure is especially affecting the people living in the dry areas because of the marginal and fragile nature of the resources they have access to. There are over 2,000 million hectares of land that have been degraded, with a loss of agrobiodiversity, increased water scarcity and increased natural resource destruction. Superimposed on this is the fact that the neglectful and exploitive use of natural resources has set the train of global climate change in motion. It is anticipated that the impact of climate change will cut across all boundaries. Crops, cropping systems, rotations and biota will undergo transformation. To maintain the balance in the system, there is a need for new knowledge, alternative policies and institutional changes. The marginalized people in dry areas are likely to be most seriously hit by the shifts in moisture and temperature regimes as a result of the global climate change. To help them cope with the challenges, there is a need for a new paradigm in agricultural research and technology transfer that makes full use of modern science and technology in conjunction with traditional knowledge. This necessitates more investment by international agencies and national governments for supporting the relevant integrated research and sustainable development efforts, with full participation of the target communities. Only such an approach can enable the vulnerable communities of the dryland areas to use the natural resources in a sustainable manner and thus help protect the environment for future generations. The clock is ticking and the future of the world lies in the collective responsibility and wisdom of all nations on this planet. This should be reflected in the endorsement of a solid future plan. © 2012 El-Beltagy and Madkour; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Balancing the benefits from the water–energy–land–food nexus through agroforestry in the Sahel,"Regions affected by resource scarcity, poverty, and land-use conflicts need to advocate the merits of practices strongly grounded in sustainable land management. This review paper provides an analysis of agroforestry as an integrated system embedded in complex relations between resource uses in the Water–Energy–Land–Food (WELF) nexus. Using the African Sahel region as a case study, the paper explains the need for understanding land management practices, such as agroforestry, through the lens of trade-offs and benefits inherent in the WELF nexus. Agroforestry practices are demonstrated to be valuable interventions leading to i) resilience to climate stresses, ii) water, energy, and food securities, iii) mitigation of resource-oriented harbingers of conflicts and iv) development opportunities. These goals can also yield valuable results in terms of promoting sustainable development, i.e. functional ecosystems, livelihoods, and human security. Two overarching sub-nexuses, namely agroforestry–food–energy and agroforestry–food–water–climate, are identified in the Sahelian context and conceptualized. Primarily, the trade-offs outlined within these sub-nexuses are fuelwood vs. crops, use of land for more forests vs. more cropping, and water availability for agroforestry vs. agroforestry impacts on the water cycle. Despite the positive outcomes and opportunities, agroforestry systems in the Sahel still face some challenges such as vague land use rights, inadequate capacities and lack of investments. Policy recommendations are synthesized at three levels. This synthesis involves remedies to lessen pressures at the interlinks of WELF resource use, overarching remedies in the two sub-nexuses, and remedies across all the sectors and issues for improving agroforestry outcomes. Optimal remedies stress the importance of choosing the right land, water and plant combinations as well as incorporating efficiency measures and alternative sources. A successful agroforestry system is characterized by a conducive environment at the farm level in terms of institutions, management, enhancing the farmer's capacity, and good infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
The Impact of Food Overproduction on Soil: Perspectives and Future Trends,"This comprehensive document explores the multifaceted implications of food overproduction on soil sustainability, encompassing environmental, soci-etal, and economic aspects. It delves into the global landscape of food produc-tion, highlighting key statistics and the leading countries in this domain. The Euro-pean Union’s directives, strategies, and action plans related to food production are discussed, emphasizing the Farm to Fork Strategy, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. Furthermore, the document scrutinizes the environmental consequences of food overproduction, including deforestation, soil degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions from food waste. It also examines the societal impacts, such as food insecurity, malnutrition, and economic disparities resulting from market dynamics. The economic ramifications of food overproduc-tion, including direct economic losses, waste management costs, and the adverse effects on farmers’ livelihoods, are thoroughly analyzed. In particular, the document emphasizes the critical importance of soil health in sustainable food production. It discusses how soil degradation, erosion, pollution, and acidification are intercon-nected with food production practices and explores the global implications of these soil-related issues. Ultimately, this document underscores the urgent need for tran-sitioning towards sustainable and regenerative agriculture practices to address the challenges posed by food overproduction. © 2024 by Springer International Publishing.",About Sufficiency
"Approaches to energy transitions: Carbon pricing, managed decline, and/or green new deal?","The need for wholescale energy transitions across the globe is now clear, but there is still much debate about how best to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

Creating Wealth from Agrowaste: Success Stories from India,"India is among the significant agricultural economies of the world. The Green Revolution of the 1970s facilitated this overpopulated country to overcome the imminent threats of food insecurity while ensuring optimal crop production. India’s economy is majorly agricultural, with more than 70% of its population directly or indirectly dependent on farm-based livelihoods and their associated options. Agricultural production has increased manifold over the last few decades due to land use cover changes, conversion of forest lands into agricultural lands, technological improvement influencing productivity, quality inputs, intensive farm policies, and exponential population growth. This fast-paced growth, however, has detrimentally impacted India’s natural resources. Agriculture accounts for 18% of India’s total greenhouse gas emissions, as communicated to UNFCCC. We need to mitigate climate change and increase the production of food and energy for a nation projected to exceed a population of 10 billion people by 2050. Meeting the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), which aims for holistic and inclusive growth, can help us overcome this challenge. Many countries have adopted and implemented national policies based on efficient resource management by ensuring maximum resource generation and minimal waste production. Agriculture is one of the bulkiest socio-economic sectors with total biomass production. India is, in fact, among the top rice cultivating countries in the world. Agricultural waste management, however, is a severe problem. Farmers often dispose of the vast amounts of rice straw generated as the main crop leftover by resorting to environmentally harmful approaches such as stubble burning. Many recent efforts have successfully converted stubble to biogas, different biofuels, fertilizers, and growth medium. Proper, sustainable, and scientific agricultural waste management can diversify livelihood options and contribute significantly to new emerging markets. This discussion summarizes agro-residue management strategies such as bioconversion of stubble into organic manure, electricity, and biogas. The chapter would further document such success stories practised by Indian farmers on the field, which has heavily reduced agrowaste generation and open new vistas of opportunities while ensuring sustainable development and facilitation of green growth of Indian economy. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",About Sufficiency
"Double transplantation as a climate resilient and sustainable resource management strategy for rice production in eastern Uttar Pradesh, north India","-Enhancing the productivity of rainfed crops, especially rice, while coping with climate adversities and saving critical natural resources is essential for ensuring the food and nutrition security of a growing population. With this context, the present study was undertaken to validate promising farm innovation and adaptation practices used by small-medium landholding farmers for rice cultivation in eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP), north India, as well as to examine the sustainability of innovative practices for large-scale adoption. For this, a 3-year study comprising extensive field surveys and experiments was undertaken to compare single transplantation (ST) and double transplantation (DT) in rice along with organic addition (farm-yard manure, FYM) on crop growth, yield, climate resilience, soil quality, and overall sustainability i.e., social (women involvements and labour productivity), environmental (water productivity and nutrient use efficiency), and economic (benefit:cost ratio) dimensions of sustainability. Field experiments were conducted in triplicate using two local rice varieties (MotiNP-360 and Sampurna Kaveri) in two agroclimatic zones, namely the middle Gangetic plains and the Vindhyan zone, in the Mirzapur district of eastern Uttar Pradesh. The DT practices of rice with and without farm yard manure (FYM) (replacing at a dose of 25% NPK) were evaluated over conventional methods of rice cultivation (i.e., ST, as control) and analysis was done periodically. The DT practice improved growth (p < 0.05), percent fertile tiller and grain (p < 0.05), and rice yield (15–20% higher than ST), while also improving soil quality, yield indices, water and labour productivity, and the benefit-cost ratio. The DT practice also resulted in early maturity (10–15 days earlier than ST), created more labour days for women, decreased lodging and pest/disease incidence, as well as a subsequent reduction in the use of synthetic chemical pesticides and associated environmental costs. Importantly, the residual effects of FYM application significantly improved (p < 0.05) the grain yield in subsequent years of cropping. Optimizing DT cultivation practices, preferably with FYM input for various agro-climatic regions, is essential for large-scale sustainable rice production under changing climatic conditions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Are we in deep water? Water scarcity and its limits to economic growth,"Water is an important factor of production contributing both directly and indirectly to economic activity across all sectors and regions of the global economy. Water scarcity may therefore go beyond having important consequences for people, society and ecological systems but may also pose a threat to economic growth. Using the latest IPCC RCP projections and the OECD Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) for population growth and economic output, we develop a multi-regional input-output model to estimate future demand for water resources across different countries and sectors of the global economy. Model results show that most countries will experience declining water availability, particularly those countries that experience a confluence of factors including low fresh water availability, high climate change impacts, and growing consumption patterns. We show that virtual water trade and improved water efficiency has potential to alleviate the worst effects of water scarcity for wealthy countries but may have limited effect on poorer countries. The analysis concludes that the most important driver of future water scarcity is economic growth, which overwhelms any realistic savings that can be made from increased technological progress and improvements to water efficiency. Population growth and climate change are also shown to be important drivers of future water scarcity, particularly over the long-run. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
"Impact of ozone pollution on crop yield, human health, and associated economic costs in the Indo-Gangetic plains","Ozone pollution is a growing problem in many developing countries posing challenges not only to air quality but also affecting agricultural productivity and human well-being. This is the first study in the Indo-Gangetic Plain exploring how the spatial variation and severity of tropospheric ozone affect both wheat yield and all-cause mortality. We estimated that ozone-related cumulative crop production loss for wheat in selected districts of IGP was 3.4 million tonnes during the study period (2019–2021), which amounted to 923 million USD. The production-weighted Relative Yield Loss (RYL) for wheat in the IGP was 9.3 % in 2019, 12.8 % in 2020, and 11.3 % in 2021. The losses incurred in 2021 could contribute to fulfilling the wheat requirements of 11.4 million people. We also assess the health and economic gains resulting from the attainment of the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines (WHO AQG) for ozone concentrations. It is estimated that interventions that achieve AQG would have averted 11,407 premature deaths in 2021 translating into an impressively large health and economic gain. The annual benefits in 2021 totaled to 34 billion USD. We observe that Uttar Pradesh experienced the highest losses, both in terms of crop damage and premature deaths. Our study observes that implementing policies to prepone the planting of wheat enhances food security by mitigating yield losses. Mitigating the health impact of ambient ozone necessitates a reduction in anthropogenic emissions and to attain this objective, we propose adopting an exposure-integrated source reduction approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
"Systems perspectives in agricultural education, research and development: A vision for sustaining food security in Asia","Systems perspectives are fundamental in driving technological improvements and yield-enhancing strategies that improve agricultural productivity. These can resolve farmer's problems and are important pathways for sustaining food and nutritional security for human welfare in Asia. The essential determinants of this objective are the capacity to efficiently manage the natural resource base (land, crops, animals, and water) to resolve constraints to farming systems, and notably the integration of multiple research and development (R&D) issues through all levels of formal and non-formal learning systems. Both formal and informal education systems are important, with the former relating more to universities and colleges, and the latter to the intermediate level. Graduates from this level have the primary responsibility of introducing improved technologies and change to farmers, mainly along production and disciplinary pathways. The traditional research-extension-farmer model for technology delivery is no longer acceptable, due to ""top down"" extension functions and prescriptions, ineffectiveness to cope with the dynamics of production systems, complex interactions within the natural resources, effects of climate change and globalisation. There are also reservations on the technical capacity and skills of extension agents, constraints identification, methods for technology diffusion and dissemination, and innovative use of beneficial technological improvements that can directly respond to the needs of small farmers, and impact on subsistence agriculture. Agricultural education and systems perspectives are therefore an overriding compelling necessity which transcends prevailing limitations to waning agriculture and rural growth. Their wider recognition and applications provides an important means to maximise efficiency in the potential use; of the natural resources, increase engagement and investments in agriculture, promote ways to become more self-reliant in the development of crucial new technologies and intensification. These together can meet the challenges of the future and overcome the legacy of continuing poverty, food and nutritional insecurity. Asian farming systems, with their diversity of crops and animals, traditional methods, multiple cropanimal interactions, numerous problems of farmers present increasingly complex issues of natural resource management (NRM) and the environment. Many if not all of these can only be resolved by interdisciplinary R&D, which overcomes a major weakness of many R&D programmes presently and in the past. Improved education and training is a powerful and important driver of community-based participation aimed at enhancing sustainable food security, poverty reduction and social equity in which the empowerment of women in activities that support organising themselves is also an important pathway to enhance self-reliance and their contribution to agriculture. A vision for the future in which improved agricultural education in a systems context can provide the pathway to directly benefit the revitalisation of agriculture and agricultural development is proposed with a three-pronged strategy as follows: • Define policy for the development of appropriate curricular for formal agricultural education that provides strong multi-disciplinary orientation and improved understanding of the natural resources (land, crops, animals and water) and their interactions • Organise formal degree education and specialisation at the university level that reflects strong training in understanding of agricultural systems; systems perspectives, methodologies and their application, and • Define non-formal education and training needs that can be intensified at different levels, including the trainin of trainers as agents of change. The agenda and strategies for improving agriculture needs to take a holistic and innovative view of ways to transform the diminishing resource base, potential of rainfed areas to increase food production, improved yield-enhancing technology application including the use of ruminants as the entry point for development, poverty complex, food and nutrition security, and environmental management.",About Sufficiency
"Leveraging agroecology for solutions in food, energy, and water","Global agriculture is facing growing challenges at the nexus of interconnected food, energy and water systems, including but not limited to persistent food insecurity and diet-related diseases; growing demands for energy and consequences for climate change; and declining water resources, water pollution, floods and droughts. Further, soil degradation and biodiversity loss are both triggers for and consequences of these problems. In this commentary, we argue that expanding agroecological principles, tools, and technologies and enhancing biological diversity can address these challenges and achieve better socioeconomic outcomes. Agroecology is often described as multi- or transdiscplinary, and applies ecological principles to the design and management of agricultural systems through scientific research, practice and collective action. While agroecology has roots in the study of food systems, agricultural land use has many direct and indirect linkages to water and energy systems that could benefit from agroecological insights, including use of water resources and the development of bio-based energy products. Although opportunities from the science and the practice of agroecology transcend national boundaries, obstacles to widespread adoption vary. In this article, we therefore focus on the United States, where key barriers include a shortage of research funds, limited supporting infrastructure, and cultural obstacles. Nevertheless, simply scaling up current models of agricultural production and land use practices will not solve many of the issues specific to food related challenges nor would such an approach address related energy and water concerns. We conclude that a first critical step to discovering solutions at the food, energy, water nexus will be to move past yield as a sole measure of success in agricultural systems, and call for more holistic considerations of the co-benefits and tradeoffs of different agricultural management options, particularly as they relate to environmental and equity outcomes.

Conceptual framework for balancing society and nature in net-zero energy transitions,"Transitioning to a low carbon energy future is essential to meet the Paris Agreement targets and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To understand how societies can undertake this transition, energy models have been developed to explore future energy scenarios. These models often focus on the techno-economic aspects of the transition and overlook the long-term implications on both society and the natural environment. Without a holistic approach, it is impossible to evaluate the trade-offs, as well as the co-benefits, between decarbonisation and other policy goals. This paper presents the Energy Scenario Evaluation (ESE) framework which can be used to assess the impact of energy scenarios on society and the natural environment. This conceptual framework utilises interdisciplinary qualitative and quantitative methods to determine whether an energy scenario is likely to lead to a publicly acceptable and sustainable energy transition. Using the SDGs, this paper illustrates how energy transitions are interconnected with human development and the importance of incorporating environmental and socio-economic data into energy models to design energy scenarios which meet other policy priorities. We discuss a variety of research methods which can be used to evaluate spatial, environmental, and social impacts of energy transitions. By showcasing where these impacts will be experienced, the ESE framework can be used to facilitate engagement and decision-making between policymakers and local communities, those who will be directly affected by energy transitions. Outputs of the ESE framework can therefore perform an important role in shaping feasible and energy transitions which meet the Paris Agreement targets and SDGs. © 2021 The Authors",About Sufficiency
Environment and Inclusive Growth: Concerns and Solutions,"The ecology and all of its components are suffering greatly as a result of the unchecked speed of development. At this rate, environmental degradation will have an impact on humanity and associated fields. In order to prevent the consequences of expansion from pushing the environment into a situation from which it is incapable of recovering, there should be ongoing, earnest efforts made towards sustainable development. The three pillars of ecodevelopment are the environment, humanity, and economy. A stable growth rate is necessary to attain a just balance between these pillars. Since agriculture employs the majority of the population, it also has an impact on the balance of the ecosystem. Because every unplanned step towards progress puts us back in the environmental front, we must thus be mindful of the boundaries of environmental challenges in order to achieve equitable economic growth. The hope for sustainable development lies in decreased deforestation, greater food security, conservative agricultural practices, the use of biopesticides, and prudent use of natural resources. To be effective, environmental policy probably needs to employ a variety of tools, each addressing a distinct aspect of the issue and attempting to minimise redundancies and pointless regulations. Appropriately pricing environmental inputs facilitates sustainable resource provision and use management. Long-term corporate investment in new technology and innovation is encouraged by a consistent and clear environmental policy, which also increases investment certainty. Environmental and economic success are interdependent. Economic activity and advancement depend on the natural environment because it provides the resources needed to produce goods and services and because it processes and absorbs waste and pollution, which are unwanted byproducts. This paper focuses on how environmental assets assist control risks associated with social and economic activities, flood risks, local climate regulation (temperature and air quality), and the availability of clean water and other resources. © 2024 E3S Web of Conferences",About Sufficiency
"Natural resource exploitation in Cambodia: An examination of use, appropriation, and exclusion","In the beginning of the 1990s, after a traumatic modern history of conflicts and genocides, the Kingdom of Cambodia, with the support of the international community, entered an era of relative peace. Cambodia is endowed with valuable natural resources and biodiversity. Over the past decade, however, economic development has relied primarily on the unsustainable exploitation of these resources. Current trends in the use of resources in forestry, fishery, and agricultural land are unsustainable. The central position of the article is that resource appropriation by the political, economic, and military elites has gradually excluded the majority of the population from the country's forests, fisheries, and arable areas.

"Analysing the impact of water access and sanitation on local economic development (LED) in the Sedibeng District Municipality, South Africa","Globalization, climate change and increasing populations have put severe pressure on service delivery and water management in developing countries. This is not unique to South Africa, as the country is still plagued by significant inequalities and compromised service delivery relating to water access and sanitation. Despite these challenges, clean water and access to sufficient and safe sanitation facilities remain crucial for human health, food production, industrial output and social stability. As such, the main purpose of the study was to analyse the impact of water access and sanitation on local economic development (LED) within the Sedibeng District Municipality in South Africa. The study followed a quantitative approach using annual time series data between 1995 to 2018. Various econometric methods were employed including unit root tests, ARDL Bounds test for co-integration, an Error Correction Model (ECM) as well as Toda-Yamamoto granger causality tests. The results show the presence of both long and short run relationships between the dependent and independent variables. Having access to water facilities within households as well as quality sanitation contributes positively to the economic and social wellbeing of the region. Causality results further indicated a bi-directional relationship between water access and the local economic development index highlighting the interdependence of these aspects. The findings reiterate the significance of these resources to the wellbeing of the region. Not only does the access to these basic services contribute to the quality of life for many but its linkages within various economic domains such as diversification, energy utilization, employment and productivity make them vital drivers for the region's prosperity. As such, water and sanitation management should receive high priority in local stakeholders' policy agenda. Focus should be shifted to the implementation of sustainable water practices and improved sanitation infrastructure development to enhance the economic and social sustainability of the region. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",About Sufficiency
Growing towards a food-secure Africa in 2050: reflections and pathways,"In a context of fast population growth, urbanization, sluggish agricultural productivity growth and climate change, Africa is facing a major food security challenge in the coming decades. This chapter breaks down this complex challenge into what is required and what is desired for food systems transformation, considering both consumption- and production-related aspects. We argue that efforts to move food systems towards greater food and nutrition security should consider four interrelated domains: agriculture, ecosystems, trade and nutrition. By taking concrete examples from this volume’s 21 chapters, we discuss challenges, threats and opportunities for each of these domains, as well as synergies and trade-offs between them. We also stress that food systems transformation hinges on powerful macro-trends in the spheres of domestic governance, international arenas and climate change. We conclude by proposing four potential drivers of change: crisis breeding change, a diffusion of best practices (‘ripple effects’), regional coordination and global coordination. While we argue that each of these drivers will ultimately yield positive outcomes, the human and environmental costs involved depend a lot on levels of ambition and coordination that is achieved. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Michiel de Haas and Ken E.

Groundwater Management and Governance in MENA Region,"The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is an arid and hyper arid region with nineteen countries/states with annual renewable freshwater per capita below water scarcity threshold (1000 m3/year). Groundwater is a key resource in the MENA region for improving water supply and agriculture uses. Due to the scarcity of renewable freshwater, increasing demand, and stress on surface water, nearly twelve states primarily depend on groundwater as a primary source of freshwater. Groundwater resources account for more than 80% of freshwater withdrawals in six states. There are 43 transboundary aquifer systems within the region. About 50% of the MENA region’s aquifer systems are non-renewable with over-abstraction which lead to sever drop in water table and deterioration in groundwater quality. In eight states, about 85% of agriculture irrigation water comes from groundwater compared to a global average of about 35% which also affects the food security. This is exacerbated by low water use productivity within the region with an average of about $0.25/m3 compared to $0.68/m3 globally. Groundwater valuation studies indicating that the economic value of groundwater is some states ranges between $0.52 and 0.85/m3. Economic valuation of groundwater supports planners and decision-makers in allocating and prioritizing available limited water resources in different developing sectors. Also, it will help in comparing between investing in groundwater protection with other environmental matters, and in balancing groundwater withdraw with conservation it for future generations. This chapter will assess how groundwater declining and deterioration due to increased demands, inefficient use and impacts of climate change should prompt MENA states to explore innovative and integrated governance frameworks to improve the management and ensure equitable access to strategic resources for both current and future generations. The groundwater importance for water security in the region should enhance the use of innovative technologies and dedicated funding towards integrated water resources management and heightened regional cooperation. Many countries in the region started to regulate groundwater resources with emphasis on allocation, well drilling, licensing, metering and sometimes pricing. However, the enforcement of these regulations is still weak. The depletion and quality deterioration of many aquifers are increasing the abstraction costs which affecting the social differentiation, as smaller farmers are pumped out and foreshadows a gradual collapse of the groundwater economy within the region. Few countries in the region still subside the groundwater abstraction which also affects the sustainability of this limited resource. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",About Sufficiency
Toward Active Community Environmental Policing: Potentials and Limits of a Catalytic Model,"This paper offers a field tested community environmental policing model to address the pressing environmental management challenges of reducing e-waste burning in informal e-waste hubs, and enforcement against informal polluting industries more broadly. This is based on our intervention to reduce e-waste burning in a substantial informal e-waste hub in the West Bank, Palestine, a 45 km2 region in which an estimated 5–10 metric tonnes of cables are burnt daily, causing serious environmental and public health consequences. In analogous e-waste hubs in the global South, environmental management solutions have focused on economically attractive alternatives to replace cable burning or policies that integrate informal recyclers with formal e-waste management systems—achieving little success. Our paper describes a two-pronged intervention in Palestine’s e-waste hub, which reduced e-waste burning by 80% through a combination of economically competitive cable grinding services and an “active” community environmental policing initiative that lowered barriers to and successfully advocated for governmental policing of e-waste burning. Our discussion of this intervention addresses the community environmental policing literature, which has documented few successes stories of real improvements to the enforcement of environmental violations. We argue that existing strategies have relied on “passive” approaches comprised of monitoring and reporting environmental violations to advocate for change. Our strategy offers a template to improve outcomes through a more “active” approach, moving from monitoring environmental violations through understanding the rationale and dynamics of violators, identifying environmental policing barriers, and implementing a feasible and persuasive strategy to overcome them. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",About Sufficiency
"Perceived effects of farm tractors in four African countries, highlighted by participatory impact diagrams","Agricultural mechanization is on the rise in Africa. A widespread replacement of manual labor and animal traction will change the face of African agriculture. Despite this potentially transformative role, only a few studies have looked at the effects of mechanization empirically, mostly focusing on yields and labor alone. This is the first paper that explores perceived agronomic, environmental, and socioeconomic effects together, thereby revealing linkages and trade-offs, some of which have been hitherto unknown. Data were collected using a novel data collection method called “participatory impact diagrams” in four countries: Benin, Kenya, Nigeria, and Mali. In 129 gendered focus group discussions, 1330 respondents from 87 villages shared their perceptions on the positive and negative effects of agricultural mechanization, and developed causal impact chains. The results suggest that mechanization is likely to have more far-reaching agronomic, environmental, and socioeconomic consequences than commonly assumed. Most perceived effects were positive, suggesting that mechanization can help to reduce poverty and enhance food security but other effects were negative such as deforestation, soil erosion, land-use conflicts, and gender inequalities. Accompanying research and policy efforts, which reflect variations in local agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions, are needed to ensure that mechanization contributes to an African agricultural transformation that is sustainable from a social, economic, and environmental perspective. © 2020, The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
"An economic analysis of biofuels: policies, trade, and employment opportunities","Increasing concerns about global climate change, energy security, high oil prices, and declining oil reserves have prompted a shift toward biofuels as a feasible and renewable alternative to fossil fuels. In light of the current state of the biofuel production technology, this paper examines why current measures of biofuel production, consumption, and trades are still inadequate to lower the level of greenhouse gas emissions to the extent necessary to tackle climate change and to ensure a sustainable future. The paper discusses in depth various issues and limitations associated with the current state of the biofuel play and highlights the importance of the much-needed switch toward the next-generation biofuels that promises to show much higher potential to combat economic, social, and environmental issues. It analyzes the pros and cons of the current biofuel policies in place for the key players in detail and shows how policies can have a significant impact on poverty, welfare, and employment prospects around the world. The paper emphasizes the role that international biofuel trade plays in enhancing economic welfare both domestically and internationally and recommends the type of policies needed to promote biofuel trades and to enhance the production of the next-generation biofuel. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Matching comparative advantages to special economic zones for sustainable industrialization,"African countries are consistently trying to leverage industrialization to advance their economic development. Despite possessing favorable factors such as abundant natural resources, a surplus of low-cost labor, and an increasing number of established Special Economic Zones (SEZs), African countries are yet to fully maximize their potential and achieve sustainable and inclusive industrialization. This study explores the comparative advantages of African countries to determine the types of SEZs that can effectively accelerate industrialization. By leveraging the unique strengths and resources of each country, customized strategies for SEZs can be developed to attract investments, promote technological advancements, and foster sustainable economic growth. The research utilizes the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) matrix, which is grounded in Ricardian trade theory, examining trade data spanning from 2011 to 2021 to evaluate the competitive export capabilities of various countries. The findings consistently reveal that the selected countries (Ghana, Ethiopia, and South Africa) possess a significant and consistent comparative advantage in natural and agricultural resources compared to other sectors. Establishing SEZs that focus on these sectors can generate substantial socio-economic impacts, including attracting investments, creating employment opportunities, enhancing export capacities, stimulating economic growth, fostering linkages, facilitating skills and technology transfer, promoting spillover effects, encouraging specialization, developing infrastructure, and supporting value addition in agribusinesses. The result of this study will contribute to policy discussions and aid decision-making processes for policymakers, investors, and development practitioners in their efforts to advance industrial development across Africa. © 2024",About Sufficiency
Financial system stability and social welfare,"The financial system has an important role for economic growth and social welfare of individuals, households, enterprises, civic and public institutions. Despite its imperfection, the financial system has the power to help us create a better and a more fair society, having an essential role in the development of wealthy economies. The recent financial crisis is the largest, most complex and delicate challenge of the current period. Authorities are deeply concerned with improving the existing framework of supervision and regulation and develop strategy programs in order to ensure stability and sustainable growth throughout Europe. The European Council has adopted the Europe 2020 Strategy which is the EU’s growth agenda for the current decade. It aims at overcoming the negative effects of the global financial crisis and emphasizes sustainable economic development and social inclusion. The fundamentals of the Europe 2020 Strategy are the five key objectives: employment, R&D expenses, climate change and energy sustainability, education and fighting poverty and social exclusion. Reviewing the impact of financial stability on social and economic development reveals low employment rates both for the EU and Romania. Current descriptive statistics analysis shows that the employment rate is higher for a higher level of education of the population considered sustaining education and training development as fundamental priority. Although R&D and innovation are key policy components of the Europe 2020 strategy, the rates are still low, especially in Romania. Having more innovative products and services on the market addresses job creation through increased industrial competitiveness, productivity and efficient use of resources. © 2017, Editura Lumen.

Gender and sustainability: Lessons from Asia and Latin America,"This is one of the first books to address how gender plays a role in helping to achieve the sustainable use of natural resources. The contributions collected here deal with the struggles of women and men to negotiate such forces as global environmental change, economic development pressures, discrimination and stereotyping about the roles of women and men, and diminishing access to natural resources-not in the abstract but in everyday life. Contributors are concerned with the lived complexities of the relationship between gender and sustainability. Bringing together case studies from Asia and Latin America, this valuable collection adds new knowledge to our understanding of the interplay between local and global processes. Organized broadly by three major issues-forests, water, and fisheries-the scholarship ranges widely: the gender dimensions of the illegal trade in wildlife in Vietnam; women and development issues along the Ganges River; the role of gender in sustainable fishing in the Philippines; women's inclusion in community forestry in India; gender-based confrontations and resistance in Mexican fisheries; environmentalism and gender in Ecuador; and women's roles in managing water scarcity in Bolivia and addressing sustainability in shrimp farming in the Mekong Delta. Together these chapters show why gender issues are important for understanding how communities and populations deal daily with the challenges of globalization and environmental change. Through their rich ethnographic research, the contributors demonstrate that gender analysis offers useful insights into how a more sustainable world can be negotiated-one household and one community at a time. © 2012 The Arizona Board of Regents.

A Scenario Analysis of Climate Change and Ecosystem Services for the Great Barrier Reef,"The extent to which nations and regions can actively shape the future or must passively respond to global forces is a topic of relevance to current discourses on climate change, ecosystems services, and human well-being. In Australia, climate change has been identified as the greatest threat to the ecological resilience of the Great Barrier Reef and the multiple ecosystem services it provides, but is exacerbated by regional and local pressures. In this chapter, we discuss previous applications of scenario analysis and describe a case study we undertook to explore how two key uncertainties may influence these threats and their impact on the Great Barrier Reef and adjacent catchment's ecosystem services in the future. These two uncertainties were whether (1) global development and (2) Australian development are defined and pursued primarily in terms of economic growth or broader concepts of human well-being and environmental sustainability, and, in turn, how climate change is managed and mitigated. We compared the implications of four scenarios for marine and terrestrial ecosystem services and human well-being. The results suggest that while regional actions can partially offset global inaction on climate change until about mid-century, there are probable threshold levels for marine ecosystems, beyond which the Great Barrier Reef will become a fundamentally different system by 2100 if climate change is not curtailed. Management that can respond to pressures at both global and regional scales will be needed to maintain the full range of ecosystem services. It is possible to maintain human well-being even while some ecosystem services decline, but only if regional management is strong. The future of the region depends largely on whether national and regional decision makers choose to be active future 'makers' or passive future 'takers' in responding to global drivers of change. The chapter concludes by discussing potential avenues for using these scenarios for further discussion and consensus building with the Great Barrier Reef region's stakeholders. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Unequal Vulnerability to Climate Change and the Transmission of Adverse Effects Through International Trade,"In this paper, we consider the unequal distribution of climate change damages in the world and we examine how the underlying costs can spread from a vulnerable to a non-vulnerable country through international trade. To focus on such indirect effects, we treat this topic in a North–South trade overlapping generations model in which the South is vulnerable to the damages entailed by global pollution while the North is not. We show that the impacts of climate change in the South can be sources of welfare loss for northern consumers in both the long and the short run. In the long run, an increase in the South’s vulnerability can reduce the welfare in the North economy even in the case in which it improves the terms of trade of the North. In the short run, the South’s vulnerability can also represent a source of intergenerational inequity in the North. Therefore, we emphasize the strong economic incentives for non-vulnerable—and a fortiori less vulnerable—economies to reduce the climate change damages on more vulnerable countries. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",About Sufficiency
Green planet blues: Critical perspectives on global environmental politics,"Revised and updated throughout, the fifth edition of this unique anthology examines global environmental politics from a range of perspectives-contemporary and classic, activist and scholarly-and reflects voices of the powerless and powerful.

Biomolecules from olive pruning waste in Sierra Mágina – Engaging the energy transition by multi-actor and multidisciplinary analyses,"The price volatility of fossil resources, the uncertainty of their long-term availability and the environmental, climatic and societal problems posed by their operation lead to the need of an energy transition enabling the development and utilization of other alternative and sustainable resources. Acknowledging that indirect land-use change can increase greenhouse gas emission, the European Union (EU) has reshaped its biofuel policy. It has set criteria for sustainability to ensure that the use of biofuels guarantees real carbon savings and protects biodiversity. From a sustainability perspective, biofuels and bioliquids offer indeed both advantages (e.g., more secure energy supply, emission reductions, reduced air pollution and production of high added-value molecules) as well as risks (monocultures, reduced biodiversity and even higher emissions through land use change). Approaching economic, environmental and social sustainability at the local level and in an integrated way should help to maximize benefits and minimize risks. This approach has been adopted and is described in the present work that combines chemical, biological, social and territorial studies on the management of pruning waste residues from olive trees in the Sierra Mágina in Spain. The biological and social analyses helped to orientate the research towards an attractive chemical process based on extraction and pyrolysis, in which high added value molecules are recovered and in which the residual biochar may be used as pathogen-free fertilizer. In this region where farmers face declining economic margins, the new intended method may both solve greenhouse gas emission problems and provide farmers with additional revenues and convenient fertilizers. Further research with a larger partnership will consolidate the results and tackle issues such as the logistics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Required and desired: breakthroughs for future-proofing mineral and metal extraction,"The global industrial mining sector is, like other sectors, undergoing an unprecedented transformation pushed by global sustainability and climate challenges. The need to increase productivity and efficiency of mineral extraction along with increasing pressure from a wide range of stakeholders to decarbonise the industry and make mining practices more sustainable, accountable, and socially acceptable are driving the adoption of automation and digitalisation technologies as well as the electrification of equipment and the implementation of more sustainable energy solutions for the industry. Automation and digitalisation are changing the way minerals and metals are extracted and provide important tools for designing and implementing the mine of the future: a digitally integrated, autonomous mine where no humans need to be put in harm’s way and in which the connected systems are able to reduce the ever-increasing complexity to such an extent that improved decision-making can be realised in real time. Mining as an industry still has a way to go to reach the potential of automation and digitalisation on the one hand, and alternative drive systems and sustainable power generation on the other. This paper will give an overview of empirically derived leading technologies underlying the current transformation and will place them in the context of the data-information-value-chain that can provide a more systematic approach to describe the various technologies and, in particular, their interrelationships. This can support a better understanding of assessing the overall technological maturity of an operation, especially with respect to their evolution from automation of equipment towards autonomous systems. There is no reason to doubt that, from a technology perspective, the digitally connected, autonomous, and carbon-free mine have the potential to become a reality. Breakthrough effects can be expected to come not from any single technology but rather from successfully developing, implementing, and integrating the full suite of (available) automation and digitalisation technologies across entire mining operations and moving towards digitally integrated, autonomous systems considering the process and its interrelations holistically (Clausen et al. 2020b). However, in order to get there, mining companies need to consider not only the technological aspects of this transformation. For successfully responding to the changing landscape of stakeholder expectations and future-proofing the industry requires, the authors argue that mining companies need to adopt a mind-set of the human-centred climate smart mine (Clausen and Sörensen 2021). In addition, mining companies need to reconsider their role in the economic, social, and environmental ecosystem they are embedded in so they can break through traditions that keep them from successfully positioning themselves as builders of social value. © 2022, The Author(s).",About Sufficiency
The bottom line: capital’s production of social inequalities and environmental degradation,"Sustainability is a contested concept that has been at the center of discussions of natural and social scientists for decades. Mainstream conceptualizations, predicated upon the “three-legged stool” and “triple bottom line model,” argue that questions of economic, social, and environmental sustainability are of equal importance. However, in actuality, the “economic” leg of the stool is given primacy in these analyses. These mainstream conceptions take for granted that economic means the capitalist system, failing to assess how its growth dynamics undermine sustainability. Capitalism, as a historically distinct political-economic system, depends on expropriation and exploitation, creating social inequalities and environmental degradation increasingly on a global scale. Critical sustainability confronts the logic of capital, directly challenging this very system in an effort to create substantive equality, meet human needs, and protect the conditions of life. © 2018, AESS.",About Sufficiency
The global food crisis: Governance challenges and opportunities,"The global food crisis is a stark reminder of the fragility of the global food system. The Global Food Crisis: Governance Challenges and Opportunities captures the debate about how to go forward and examines the implications of the crisis for food security in the world's poorest countries, both for the global environment and for the global rules and institutions that govern food and agriculture. In this volume, policy-makers and scholars assess the causes and consequences of the most recent food price volatility and examine the associated governance challenges and opportunities, including short-term emergency responses, the ecological dimensions of the crisis, and the longer-term goal of building sustainable global food systems. The recommendations include vastly increasing public investment in small-farm agriculture; reforming global food aid and food research institutions; establishing fairer international agricultural trade rules; promoting sustainable agricultural methods; placing agriculture higher on the post-Kyoto climate change agenda; revamping biofuel policies; and enhancing international agricultural policy-making. © 2009 by Wilfrid Laurier University Press.

The role of organic farming for food security: Local nexus with a global view,"A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. It has been the core concept of the Milan Expo 2015, whose title, Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life, embodied the challenge to provide the world's growing population with a sustainable, secure supply of safe, nutritious, and affordable high-quality food using less land with lower inputs. Meeting the food security agenda using current agricultural production techniques cannot be achieved without serious degradation to the environment, including soil degradation, loss of biodiversity and climate change. Organic farming is seen as a solution to the challenge of sustainable food production, as it provides more nutritious food, with less or no pesticide residues and lower use of inputs. A limit of organic farming is its restricted capability of producing food compared to conventional agriculture, thus being an inefficient approach to food production and to food security. The authors maintain, on the basis of a scientific literature review, that organic soils tend to retain the physical, chemical and biological properties over the long term, while maintaining stable levels of productivity and thereby ensuring long-term food production and safety. Furthermore, the productivity gap of organic crops may be worked out by further investment in research and in particular into diversification techniques. Moreover, strong scientific evidence indicates that organic agricultural systems deliver greater ecosystem services and social benefits.",About Sufficiency
"Agricultural cooperatives, entrepreneurship and food security in Malawi","This Study investigates the role that agricultural cooperatives play in advancing entrepreneurship for increased food security and income, in the rural areas of developing countries. It examines cooperative member self-efficacy, entrepreneurship skills and attitudes, through self-evaluation of cooperative viability. Ergo, this article uncovers the challenges, local solutions and sources of resilience in the agricultural cooperatives of developing countries. Collected through a survey, primary and secondary data were analyzed using SPSS 23, and content analysis was performed on qualitative data. The results reveal a high self-efficacy for cooperative members and a high motivation for market development and profitability. Agricultural cooperatives lag behind in information and communication techniques (ICT), and have a limited capability to resolve challenges, yet they achieve income higher than the national average income per head per year. Despite its limitations, the study urges cooperatives to reject economic growth models that damage the environment and promote short-term economic growth against environmental susstainability. Future research directions and policymaking recommendations pertain to the need for innovation, self-coordination, and openning up and sharing to accompany economic, social, cultural and political self-development, in ways that respect, protect and adapt to nature, through resource conservation, restoration and protection. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

Improving Climate Change Resilience in Global South Cities Through South- South Climate Finance,"Climate change is likely to exacerbate inequality and poverty in Global South cities despite the presence of international agreements and conventions to enhance sustainable development such as the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Moreover, replicating Global North development models in the Global South might not be sufficient to address the climate change and development aspirations in the context of Asia; hence, Global North innovation capabilities might not be sufficient to address Global South climate change challenges. This paper provides an inductive analysis of the innovations and policies that could facilitate improved climate change mitigation and adaptation in the context of developing Asian cities. The paper concludes that innovative climate change policies should utilise emerging climate finance mechanisms such as South-South climate finance modalities to promote community science/citizen science and social innovation rather than building hard infrastructure as this could improve the governance and distribution of resources in cities. © 2022 by IGI Global.

Identifying interlinkages between urbanization and Sustainable Development Goals,"Urbanization and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are important global issues in the current “Anthropocene”. Climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated global urban problems and hindered the ability to meet SDGs on time, while the broad interlinkages between urbanization and the SDGs remain poorly understood. This study shows that among the interlinkages of urbanization with 17 SDGs, synergies are observed with 151 targets (89%), among which 67 (40%) have stronger synergies, and trade-offs are observed with 66 targets (39%), among which 31 (18%) have stronger trade-offs. Furthermore, the synergies and trade-offs between urbanization and the achievement of SDGs are specifically analyzed based on four fundamental interaction fields: (a) public health and social welfare equality; (b) energy consumption and economic growth; (c) natural resource use and ecological/environmental impacts; and (d) international cooperation for development. Finally, based on these analyses, we propose four recommendations for sustainable urbanization, including (a) shared well-being and spatial justice for urban and rural residents; (b) guiding green and low-carbon urban development; (c) building resilient cities; and (d) promoting multilateral cooperation in cities, which can contribute to the achievement of SDGs by 2030. © 2022",About Sufficiency

Sustaining national food security and increasing farmers' income through quality seed,"Since independence, India achieved a distinction from ship-to-mouth status to self dependent, food surplus and net exporter of food grains in 69 years and recorded an all time high (285.2 million tonnes) production during 2018-19 from meagre 50.8 mt during 1950-51. In spite of spectacular success in food production over the years, it is a great challenge to sustain high production as well as enhance it further to meet the future requirement, as the population continues to grow steadily with an annual growth rate of 1.10% and expected to be 1.42 billion and 1.48 billion by 2025 and 2030, respectively, from 1.32 billion during 2017; coupled with enhanced consumption of food grains due to rising income, necessitating an increase of 4.5% and 15.7% by 2020 and 2030, respectively, over the present food production. It is a great challenge in view of climate change, diminishing and degrading land and water resources, increasing biotic and abiotic stresses and loss of bio-diversity. The present paper discusses the trend of production and productivity of food crops from 1950-51 to 2018-19; assess the contribution of seed to food production, seed chain, quality seed production and scope of quality seed for enhancing farmers' income and future strategies for seed research, production and development to sustain food production. Requisite assets such as a strong crop specific cultivar development programmes, 850 high yielding food crop varieties comprising 657 of cereals and 193 of pulses released during the last six years, robust and vibrant seed systems, quality regulatory mechanism, globally competitive seed sector and the largest arable land with 46 soil types across 15 agro-climatic zones favouring seed production of diverse crops are available for sustaining high food production and meet the future demand for seed and food. Ensuring availability of quality seed in adequate quantity though imperative, yet, itself is not enough to trigger the production if it is not coupled with achieving sufficient varietal diversity in seed chain preferably phasing out gradually the old and obsolete varieties and inducting recently developed high yielding and disease resistant varieties. The overall progress and outcome are largely dependent on Government policies and support, which require consistent and adequate financial resources for sustaining a vibrant seed production, farm power machinery, processing units, storage, seed testing, delivery systems and trained human resources besides remunerative prices to the farmers. © 2020 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

Groundwater-sourced irrigation and agro-power subsidies: Boon or bane for small/marginal farmers in India?,"Growing inequity in access to sustainable irrigation supply services, groundwater and electricity in particular, has become core agendas in many recent global development dialogues on account of food/nutritional security, ensuring on-farm livelihood opportunities, rural poverty alleviation and development. Herein, we aim to present a nation-wide appraisal of eco-environmental and socioeconomic ramifications of subsidizing farm-power services in India, to highlight future requirements to conserve groundwater reserves so as to ensure sustainable irrigation supply services. We adopted a mixed method approach, coupling secondary data analysis (obtained from various governmental archives), with a systematic review of relevant global literature. For the latter, we adopted a multi-stage PRISMA method (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) to summarize observations from post-2000 literature. Our results indicate that, over the years, groundwater has emerged as the mainstay of the irrigation sector in India (via millions of tube/bore wells), replacing surface-water systems (canals). However, unsustainable groundwater drafting has led to (i) significant groundwater drawdowns in most Indian states; (ii) exacerbated greenhouse gas emissions; and (iii) caused extensive soil-water salinization, which impede sustainable agrarian/rural development on long-run. Current literature, however, suggests that, unsustainable groundwater drafting is indulged at policy level only by (i) relaxed groundwater tariffing scheme, and (ii) lucrative agro-power subsidies – collectively which offer the farmers free reign to draft groundwater at will. We reflect on the rise of groundwater market, leading to disproportionate access to groundwater for irrigation, and tragedy of the less-endowed sections of the famring communities. We urge the concerned authorities to devise and implement strategic institutional reforms to bolster the agro-power subsidy delivery mechanisms, and reflect on opportunities of nationwide adoption of feeder channel segregation (FCS) and initiate minimum energy support (MES) schemes. The idea is to make the agro-energy sector more efficient (based on notions of equity, fairness and transparency for all to access the benefits. In the final section we urge the authorities to adopt a systems' thinking approach to identify the key barriers to on-ground implementation of FCS and MES; introduce smart metering system, and above all, incorporate the water-food-energy nexus application in mainstream decision making for irrigation services. The idea is to identify/develop means of resource co-management, identify synergies and trade-off, within a unified framework of irrigation systems’ governance that balances resources supply and demand, without endangering the ecosystem services. We also outline potential research directions; emphasize on need of targeted, process-level investigations with increased case studies, and urge the authorities for improved data dissemination and accessibility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Trends in human development and environmental protection,"Even if the will to follow a sustainable lifestyle in the Western countries is increasing, many developing countries are experiencing their phase of economic growth, threatening and overexploiting their environment. This study compares the Living Planet Index and the Human Development Index, and suggests that societies follow common patterns of development, from the indigenous lifestyle to undeveloped society, through a developing stage, towards a developed state. According to these common steps each society exploits local, regional and sometimes global natural resources to nourish its economic growth. If developing countries will not undertake strategies to skip the ‘intermediate’ stage of overexploitation of natural resources during their growing phase, Earth systems may not be able to keep alive the global biodiversity, and provide ecosystem services that sustain humanity. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",About Sufficiency
Examples of coupled human and environmental systems from the extractive industry and hydropower sector interfaces,"Large-scale corporate projects, particularly those in extractive industries or hydropower development, have a history from early in the twentieth century of creating negative environmental, social, and health impacts on communities proximal to their operations. In many instances, especially for hydropower projects, the forced resettlement of entire communities was a feature in which local cultures and core human rights were severely impacted. These projects triggered an activist opposition that progressively expanded and became influential at both the host community level and with multilateral financial institutions. In parallel to, and spurred by, this activism, a shift occurred in 1969 with the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act in the United States, which required Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for certain types of industrial and infrastructure projects. Over the last four decades, there has been a global movement to develop a formal legal/regulatory EIA process for large industrial and infrastructure projects. In addition, social, health, and human rights impact assessments, with associated mitigation plans, were sequentially initiated and have increasingly influenced project design and relations among companies, host governments, and locally impacted communities. Often, beneficial community-level social, economic, and health programs have voluntarily been put in place by companies. These flagship programs can serve as benchmarks for community-corporate-government partnerships in the future. Here, we present examples of such positive phenomena and also focus attention on a myriad of challenges that still lie ahead. © 2016, National Academy of Sciences.

Uncertain transitions: Affects in the coal supply chain from Colombia to Poland,"We examine the dynamic affective responses along the cross-Atlantic coal supply chain from Colombia to Poland in the context of changing conditions triggered by the war in Ukraine following Russia's invasion in February 2022. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and a review of press releases and documents, our analysis focuses on the affects, emotions, social relations, and tensions resulting from people's everyday interactions with coal. We explore how unexpected events altered these interactions and how affective responses can shed light on the dynamic processes involved in the energy transition from coal. We argue that the transition is a non-linear process characterized by the diverse ways in which actors along coal supply chains experience, conceptualize, and represent it. In the context of these shifting dynamics, coal emerges as an ambiguous resource, viewed both as an outdated and polluting energy source that dispossesses Indigenous people and contributes to global warming and as a familiar and reliable fuel that provides a sense of security, maintains social relations, and remains an integral component of the global energy matrix. We conclude that a just energy transition from coal requires accounting for its complexity along supply chains, acknowledging the affective dimension of processes of change and continuity, and understanding the power dynamics between corporate agents, the state, and communities at extraction and consumption sites. © 2024 The Author(s)",About Sufficiency

As such, there is a pressing need for systematic approaches to assess these linkages among global fisheries, their effects on ecosystems and food security, and their implications for fisheries science and sustainability. Use of the telecoupling framework is a novel and insightful method to systematically evaluate socioeconomic and environmental interactions among CHANS. We apply the telecoupling framework to the Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) fishery, the world’s largest single-species commercial fishery and a complex CHANS. The anchoveta fishery has diverse and significant telecouplings, socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances, with the rest of the world, including fishmeal and fish oil trade, monetary flow, knowledge transfer, and movement of people. The use of the telecoupling framework reveals complex fishery dynamics such as feedbacks (e.g., profit maximization causing fishery overcapitalization) and surprises (e.g., stock collapse) resulting from local and long-distance ecological and socioeconomic interactions. The Peruvian anchoveta fishery illustrates how the telecoupling framework can be used to systematically assess the magnitude and diversity of local and distant fisheries interactions and thereby advance knowledge derived from traditional monothematic research approaches. Insights from the telecoupling framework provide a foundation from which to develop sustainable fisheries policy and management strategies across local, national, and international levels in a globalized world. © 2018 by the author(s).",About Sufficiency
Renegotiation of the wto agreement on agriculture: Accommodating the new big issues,"The WTO Agreement on Agriculture was designed to maximize trade flows at a time of surplus agricultural production. It required Members to open markets and to reduce domestic and export subsidies. Proposals for reform in the Doha Round negotiations largely adopt the same pattern. Yet, as surplus is replaced by shortage, Members are increasingly concerned about food security and the impact of agriculture on climate change. And contemporary agricultural policies crystallize around 'sustainable intensification', where domestic production is promoted, but not at the expense of future production. This article suggests that, although both the Agreement on Agriculture and the Doha Round proposals do provide some scope for measures to address this new policy paradigm, there are instances where they may work actively against it. © 2013 British Institute of International and Comparative Law.",About Sufficiency
UN Food Systems Summit 2021: Dismantling Democracy and Resetting Corporate Control of Food Systems,"This article analyzes the development and organization of the United Nations Food Systems Summit (UNFSS), which is being convened by UN Secretary General António Guterres in late 2021. Although few people will dispute that global food systems need transformation, it has become clear that the Summit is instead an effort by a powerful alliance of multinational corporations, philanthropies, and export-oriented countries to subvert multilateral institutions of food governance and capture the global narrative of “food systems transformation.” This article places the upcoming Summit in the context of previous world food summits and analyzes concerns that have been voiced by many within civil society. It elaborates how the current structure and forms of participant recruitment and public engagement lack basic transparency and accountability, fail to address significant conflicts of interest, and ignore human rights. As the COVID-19 pandemic illuminates the structural vulnerabilities of the neoliberal model of food systems and the consequences of climate change for food production, a high-level commitment to equitable and sustainable food systems is needed now more than ever. However, the authors suggest that the UNFSS instead seems to follow a trajectory in which efforts to govern global food systems in the public interest has been subverted to maintain colonial and corporate forms of control. © Copyright © 2021 Canfield, Anderson and McMichael.",About Sufficiency
Oil for health in sub-Saharan Africa: Health systems in a 'resource curse' environment,"Background: In a restricted sense, the resource curse is a theory that explains the inverse relationship classically seen between dependence on natural resources and economic growth. It defines a peculiar economic and political environment, epitomised by oil extraction in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Based on secondary research and illustrations from four oil-rich geographical areas (the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, Angola, southern Chad, Southern Sudan), I propose a framework for analysing the effects of the resource curse on the structure of health systems at sub-national levels. Qualitative attributes are emphasised. The role of the corporate sector, the influence of conflicts, and the value of classical mitigation measures (such as health impact assessments) are further examined. Results: Health systems in a resource curse environment are classically fractured into tripartite components, including governmental health agencies, non-profit non-governmental organisations, and the corporate extractive sector. The three components entertain a range of contractual relationships generally based on operational considerations which are withdrawn from social or community values. Characterisation of agencies in this system should also include: values, operating principles, legitimacy and operational spaces. From this approach, it appears that community health is at the same time marginalised and instrumentalised toward economic and corporate interests in resource curse settings. Conclusion: From a public health point of view, the resource curse represents a fundamental failure of dominant development theories, rather than a delay in creating the proper economy and governance environment for social progress. The scope of research on the resource curse should be broadened to include more accurate or comprehensive indicators of destitution (including health components) and more open perspectives on causal mechanisms. © 2008 Calain; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Does energy poverty contribute to gender inequality and environmental degradation in Africa?,"Purpose: This study aims to examine whether energy poverty impacts gender inequality and CO2 emissions in African countries with the biggest economies by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita from 1996 to 2020. Additionally, this study examines the existence of the gender Kuznets curve (GKC) and the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theories. Furthermore, it evaluates the connection between economic development and carbon emissions, on the one hand, and economic development and gender inequality on the other. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the augmented Dickey–Fuller and Phillip–Perron unit root tests to determine the degree of integration between the variables. It also uses the Pedroni and Fisher–Combine Johansen cointegration tests to assess a long-run relationship between the variables. The authors adopted the pooled mean group (PMG)-autoregressive distributed lag model and used the E-Views 12 software to run the analysis. Findings: The empirical analysis approves the long-run correlation among the variables used in this study. Increased energy poverty and GDP increase CO2 emissions, whereas income square hurts CO2 emissions. These results are consistent with the EKC hypothesis, which proposes a non-linear relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in the studied areas (similar to an inverted U shape). Long-term foreign direct investment (FDI) has a negative correlation with CO2 emissions. On the contrary, energy poverty, GDPsq and FDI find a positive relationship with gender inequality, whereas GDP finds a negative association with gender inequality. The negative relationship between GDPsq and gender inequality establishes a “U”-shaped connection between income and gender inequality. Thus, it supports the hypothesis of the GKC. Therefore, this study proposes that decreasing energy poverty is vital for promoting a clean environment and mitigating gender inequality. Originality/value: This study supports the hypothesis of the GKC. Therefore, this study proposes that decreasing energy poverty is vital for promoting a clean environment and mitigating gender inequality. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",About Sufficiency
AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE PROTECTION AND FOOD SECURITY IN THE FACE OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE,"Global climate change threatens world food security. This research raises the issues of priority agricultural development, increasing agricultural production, and expanding the insurance coverage of the industry. The authors propose to implement insurance activities further to prevent the effects of climate change and economic support in the emphasizfd advancfment of food production in agriculture. The research relies on direct comparative analysis, statistical and economic analysis, and monographic observational data. To conduct deep research, the authors apply analysis and synthesis. The authors also use the questionnaire methods across the country and organization, monographic research, and other methods. Furthermore, the authors used international normative documents, research of scientists in scientific periodicals, and data from official websites. The authors conclude that to protect agricultural insurance and ensure the continuous development of agriculture, it is advisable to transition from administrative methods to the following recommendations for insurance against various financial and natural losses that may arise in agriculture due to the vagaries of nature. It is also recommended to introduce a mechanism of state subsidies to compensate for the costs and improve the efficiency of insurance agents in the insurance activities of agricultural enterprises. © 2024 Aktam U.

"Cooperatives for ""fair globalization""? Indigenous people, cooperatives, and corporate social responsibility in the Brazilian Amazon","Cooperatives and socially responsible corporations are being hailed as possible correctives to the socioeconomic and ecological exploitation of transnational capitalism. AmazonCoopg a cooperative linking indigenous Brazil nut harvesters and the multinational firm The Body Shop through trade and development projectsg capitalized on indigenous symbolism to generate significant material benefits for both parties. At the same time, however, it made indigenous people more vulnerable and dependent, failed to promote participatory development, masked the effects of unfavorable state policies, and perpetuated discriminatory distinctions among indigenous people. Furthermore, the cooperative did not provide an organizational framework to ameliorate the vulnerabilities of indigenous identity politics or transform symbolic capital into enduring political-economic change. This case strongly supports arguments that cooperatives must be rooted in participation, democratic member control, and autonomy if they are to promote ""fair globalization"" or social transformation rather than institutionalize existing patterns of exploitation. © 2010 Latin American Perspectives.",About Sufficiency
Time to live well: well-being and time affluence for sustainable development,"In the face of challenges presented by climate change and rising social inequality on a global scale, scholars have criticised prevalent individualistic, economistic and materialistic definitions of well-being. In this context, Buen Vivir emerged as an alternative concept from Latin America, critically engaging with growth-centred development and current definitions of well-being. Buen Vivir promotes an alternative vision of well-being that relies on social practices, inter-personal relationships and an intact natural environment. The article argues to take up this inspiration and stresses the importance of a new conceptualisation of well-being. Thus, it presents the Index of Good Living (IGL) as an eudaimonic approach to measure well-being, resting on the concept of relational goods. The index uses time spent by individuals for certain activities as its main indicator, proposing a nuanced toolset to compare time-based inequalities in relation to well-being in different contexts. The paper discusses the theoretical and methodological aspects behind this approach and contextualises them with first empirical evidence from Ecuador and Germany. It illuminates strengths and potential openings for further refinement and indicates areas for transformative change–both in politics and in everyday life. © 2021 Global South Ltd.",About Sufficiency

Study of environmental impact of industry development,"Problems of industrial development are central in studying of foreign and domestic scientists. The definition of ""economic human"", its various modifications and capital were the central element of majority of economical researches. The quality of the environment, the limitations and availability of natural resources were under the interest in the context of: supply and demand balance of production factors; establishment of land rents size; reducing production costs. The aim of the article is to formalize the causal links between industrial development and environmental crises and investigate the mechanisms of interaction between main components of economic and ecological systems for development appropriate mathematical economic models. Industrial economical development is conducted by two environmentally destructive processes: substances and non-renewable energy resources extraction from natural cycle and environmental pollution emissions. The intensity of environmentally destructive cycle was quite small and environmental consequences of industrial development were ignored on the first steps of industrial development. Technological progress with infinity of human needs continuously expanded amounts and types of natural resources involved in anthropogenic circulation. All of these have created a variety of negative effects produced by industry. Eco-destructive cycle reached global scale on this stage of industrial development. The accumulation of imbalances of ecological system destabilizes the economic system due to loosing basis of economic development: (1) ""earth""/natural capital as result of degradation and depletion of ecosystems, (2) ""work'/human capital due to reducing population capacity that connected with the quality of life decreasing; (3) financial capital by increasing costs conned with decreasing the amount of available natural resources essential quality, increasing production costs, health protection, necessarily to reverse the effects of interrelated cycles of natural and man-made disasters. Studying of causal links between industrial production development and environmental crisis has allowed developing of cognitive map ""environmentally destructive cycle"". This map includes diagram of reinforcing loop of natural and man-made environmental disasters. According to this, it is logical to make a conclusion that the environmental crisis is an objective factor of thwart progress of economic growth in long-term.

NEVER LOOK BACK: NON-REGRESSION IN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW,"Deregulatory advocates often frame environmental protection and economic well-being as a zero-sum tradeoff. During times of economic crisis, including the long-term fallout from the global Covid-19 pandemic, policymakers may seek to withdraw or roll back environmental laws and regulations in an attempt to accelerate economic recovery. In order to safeguard the interests of vulnerable populations that suffer from pollution and other environmental harms, it is imperative to retain environmental regulations, removing or relaxing them only when there is a clear justification for doing so. Built into environmental legal frameworks in both international and domestic law is a principle of non-regression-no walking back environmental law, regulation, or protection once put in place. Governments and institutions at all levels ought to apply this principle in designing and implementing environmental governance, and judges, in their role of interpreting and applying the law, ought to incorporate the principle in their decisions and ensure the progressive realization of rights guaranteed by environmental law. This Article brings together a variety of expressions of the principle of non-regression in international treaties, trade agreements, declarations, and in domestic constitutions, statutes, and administrative law-within and outside the United States. Greater recognition of how this principle has worked in practice may be helpful in promoting the notion that, so long as environmental degradation continues to occur and threaten human well-being, environmental standards must continue to move forward and never look back. © 2022 University of Pennsylvania Law School.

Ecosystem services monetary values were used to calculate the environmental and socio-economic impact of observed land use changes. This is balanced against the economic value of the global soybean trade. The results prove that consumption choices in one region have real effects on the supply of ecosystem services at a large spatial scale. Conclusively, solutions to make this global market more sustainable are discussed. © 2016 Boerema et al.

Efficient water market mechanisms to cope with water scarcity,"Water markets are increasingly being relied upon as an instrument to reallocate water between competing users under conditions of water scarcity, and within an environment of fully committed water resources. Without such a reallocation new irrigation developments cannot take place and economic developments will be forgone to the detriment of rural communities. There is therefore a need for continued development of a water market mechanism to ensure that this reallocation process can take place as efficiently as possible, and to alleviate the socio-economic impact of water scarcity.

Analysing transitions towards sustainability and human development in European regions,"Rising social inequalities, environmental degradation and climate change are increasingly acknowledged as major threats to the long-term prosperity of modern economies. Significant attention has thus been placed on sustainability transitions in European policymaking to drive change towards a more inclusive and environmentally sustainable socio-economic system. Alongside these policy initiatives and frameworks, there has also been a rise in European tools for monitoring and measuring progress in different domains. The objective of this paper is to analyse the sustainability transition at the regional level in Europe based on a theoretical framework which links the main pillars of the sustainable development paradigm (in line with the 2030 agenda) with those of the human development paradigm. Using a dataset constructed at the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS)2 level for 2010–2019, the Sustainable Development and Human Development Index (SDHD) is developed and a spatial and econometric analysis is applied to identify spatio-temporal trends, clustering and the main determinants and spatial spillovers among the index dimensions. This contributes to the relative gap in studies covering multiple domains of sustainability across all European regions. Results highlight strong regional inequalities in both the SDHD and four domains across Europe, with a noticeable core–periphery divide. There is evidence of convergence across the EU-27, with Eastern European regions scoring the lowest but improving the most. From a spatial fixed-effects regression model, we find significant spatial dependence among neighbouring regions and that gender gaps in the labour market, teenage fertility rates and low educational attainment are significant negative determinants of SDHD. © 2025 The Author(s).

Valuing the impact of trade on local blue water,"International trade of agricultural goods impacts local water scarcity. By quantifying the effect of trade on crop production on grid-cell level and combining it with cell- and crop-specific virtual water contents, we are able to determine green and blue water consumption and savings. Connecting the information on trade-related blue water usage to water shadow prices gives us the possibility to value the impact of international food crop trade on local blue water resources. To determine the trade-related value of the blue water usage, we employ two models: first, an economic land- and water-use model, simulating agricultural trade, production and water-shadow prices and second, a global vegetation and agricultural model, modeling the blue and green virtual water content of the traded crops. Our study found that globally, the international trade of food crops saves blue water worth 2.4. billion US$. This net saving occurs despite the fact that Europe exports virtual blue water in food crops worth 3.1 billion US$. Countries in the Middle East and South Asia profit from trade by importing water intensive crops, countries in Southern Europe on the other hand export water intensive agricultural goods from water scarce sites, deteriorating local water scarcity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
"Fishery sector: Impact of technology, markets, institutions and globalisation on equity, sustainability and livelihood","Fishery resource economics as a part of natural resource/environmental economics on the one hand and aquaculture economics (farm management economics) on the other has emerged as an important branch of applied economic research during the 1980s and 1990s in India, although research efforts were initiated earlier in the West. The declining productivity of the marine and inland capture fisheries, has attracted economists to analyse the institutional aspects facilitating research in marine resource economics. Uncontrolled access to fishery resources will result in greater than optimal level of fishing effort using a catch function representing bioeconomic equilibrium considering fishing effort, catch and fish population. Clark (1985) and Anderson (1986) developed the fishery dynamic model to incorporate changes over time and space. In India, researchers worked on empirical analysis of Indian marine resources and the socio-economic impact of management regulations. The researchers have developed the multi-species fisheries management plan and by measuring the externalities of coastal aquaculture developed an integrated land use plan incorporating shrimp farming. Kumar (2004) estimated price, income and supply elasticities for disaggregated individual fish groups. The author found that the income, price and supply elasticities vary substantially across fish species and it is wrong to group them together in any policy analysis. Further in a unique exercise by using a comprehensive Asia multi- market fish model the author estimated the socio-economic impact of changes in technology, trade and policies on the producers of various categories, exporters and consumers under alternative scenarios. It is important for researchers to look into these scenarios and how the individual fishery sectors in a given region will be impacted due to policy changes.",About Sufficiency
Environmentalism-Pathways to life for humanity and sustainability,"This is a comprehensive exploration of the diverse challenges and solutions related to environmentalism and sustainability. It bridges the gaps between theory and practice, offering practical insights for academics, policymakers, and change agents. It also inspires informed action and collaborative efforts for creating a sustainable future, offering new knowledge to those who care deeply about the planet and humanity's future. The book begins with the evolution of environmentalism; tracing how ecological awareness has shaped global movements and policies. It also delves into theories of sustainability, demonstrating their relevance in addressing contemporary environmental crises. Central to the discussion is the concept of resource inequality, revealing how disproportionate resource access hinders global development and sustainability. It also explores the sustainable development goals (SDGs), presenting them as vital frameworks for policy and action, alongside climate change mitigation strategies like renewable energy, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. In the context of social equity and environmental justice, it addresses global disparities, underscoring the need for inclusive and fair solutions. Technological innovation is presented as a key driver for transforming economies into more sustainable models, including the circular economy and green finance. Furthermore, the book highlights behavioral change, mental health, and well-being as integral to advancing environmentalism. Corporate responsibility and global cooperation are examined for their roles in driving collective action, and the book emphasizes the importance of these stakeholders in addressing the environmental crisis. It also introduces the epistemology of the development economy, providing a fresh lens on sustainability that can inform both academic inquiry and practical applications. © 2025 River Publishers.

"Decentralisation and inclusivity in the energy sector: Preconditions, impacts and avenues for further research","This editorial for the Special Issue entitled ‘Energy Decentralisation – Institutional Perspectives’ in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews contrasts and compares thirteen research and review articles submitted over the last year, each with a specific regional or thematic focus. The contributions examine decentralisation, its impacts and/or institutional preconditions in the United States, Sweden, UK, Denmark, South Africa, Germany, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Australia, and include three international thematic reviews. Embedding the findings from this work in the wider literature on decentralisation and inclusivity, we identify key findings and avenues for further research. Our review begins with an overview of how energy decentralisation is conceptualised in research and policy, identifying the logics used by proponents and opponents across the literature. We review the ways in which structural institutional settings have influenced the prevalence of narratives furthered by stakeholders with different interests and worldviews, resulting in radically different policy decisions, support frameworks and incentive structures at regional or national scales. Building on these findings, our concluding discussion reflects on the factors that influence social consensus on, and effective implementation of, ambitious and inclusive energy policy. The focus of this Special Issue has become yet more relevant as governments around the world are forced to marry multiple crises in fiscal spending decisions; where significant economic support packages need to buffer the socio-economic impacts of COVID19 in the short to medium term, and simultaneously facilitate investment in infrastructure, technology and competencies that will enable the decarbonisation of the economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
Natural infrastructure investment and implications for the nexus: A global overview,"As deeply interlinked challenges to water, energy, and food security appear poised to accelerate in the coming decades, interest has grown in landscape-based approaches to manage water-energy-food (W-E-F) nexus risks and trade-offs. Both engineered and ""natural infrastructure"" approaches are needed to increase productivity and resilience in W-E-F systems and to meet pressures of a growing global population and changing climate. However, to date little information exists about the use of nature-based solutions globally, the scale of present investment, funders' motives, or observed results. This paper uses data from a global survey of watershed investments to examine the state of investment in ""natural infrastructure""-based solutions for water, which can also address nexus challenges. We find that at least US $1 billion (B) flowed to watershed investment programs tackling nexus risks and trade-offs in 2013. But attention is focused largely on agricultural impacts on water and driven mainly by water service providers and the public sector. Our preliminary findings suggest that potential funders may be unaware of, or constrained in their ability to implement, nature-based strategies to address nexus-related challenges, and that current investment likely does not match the scale of risk or dependency of our W-E-F systems on healthy landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Integrating input-output modeling with multi-criteria analysis to assess options for sustainable economic transformation: The case of Uzbekistan,"Integrating economic efficiency and environmental sustainability indicators is essential for designing policies for a sustainable development. Given the growing pressure on water resources, efficient water use becomes an essential environmental criteria for formulating adjustment reforms. Despite the wide use of backward and forward linkages as well as direct and indirect resource (energy, water, etc.) uses based on environmentally extended input-output models for assessing the performance of economic sectors, the common practice of presenting different indicators separately obstructed a straightforward policy interpretation of results. To derive a composite indicator that allows to direct ranking of sectors, we combined therefore a direct and indirect water use intensities with backward and forward linkage indexes by using the multi-criteria analysis method-TOPSIS (Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution). The model was implemented to formulate sectoral transformation measures guided by sustainable growth objectives in Uzbekistan, Central Asia, which is a representative of an area with growing water scarcity. The results showed that the presently promoted crops under the state order system-cotton and wheat-and crop preferred by farmers- rice-are the least effective production options for reaching such a sustainable growth. It is argued therefore that unbiased support for all crops through adaption of the current state order system for cotton and wheat cultivation is needed to achieve a more diversified crop portfolio with an increased share of fruits and vegetables. A further development of agro-processing industries and livestock sector bears more potential for sustainable economic development than a further promotion of producing raw agricultural commodities. Investing in industrial sectors illustrated more potential than in agriculture related sectors when aiming at economic effectiveness and increased water use efficiency. It is concluded that, with a relevant sectoral transformation, Uzbekistan has high opportunities to cope with reduced water availability. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

Food security and environmental innovation as factors for ensuring sustainable development of regions,"In modern conditions of the existence of socio-economic systems, the urgent problem is the formation of sustainable development of regions. To study the formation of sustainable development, the authors took two components, such as food security of the region and environmental innovation, an orientation towards a green economy. A comparative analysis of the theoretical aspects of the formation of food security in the works of domestic and foreign scientists is carried out. A study of the Global Food Security Index for 113 countries is presented, using the methods of statistical analysis and analytical grouping, six leading countries in terms of food security are identified. The largest group, accounting for 22.12% of the total population, is made up of countries in the 71.12-78.21 range of the Food Security Index. The grouping of countries was carried out according to the parameter ""Natural resources and sustainability"", which showed that the largest group, consisting of 38 countries or 33.62%, is in the range of 44.0-49.9, only 10 countries fell within the borders with the minimum the level of natural resources and sustainability from 32.2 to 38.1. The analysis made it possible to compile a rating and note the presence of the greatest food security problems in African countries. It is concluded that the transition to environmentally friendly ways of running the economy leads to high productivity of natural resources. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Prospects and challenges for policy convergence between the EU and China to address imported deforestation,"The EU and China are major importers of ‘forest-risk’ commodities and thus play a pivotal role in shaping the sustainability of those commodities supply chains. The EU recently introduced a regulation mandating due diligence by companies to ensure commodities are not sourced from recently deforested land. However, even if eventually successful in eliminating ‘imported’ deforestation to Europe, the regulation risks creating leakage to China and other markets. This possibility has prompted stakeholders to call for cooperation and policy alignment between the EU and China to address imported deforestation. This study applies the ‘Brussels Effect’ theory to identify what factors hinder or facilitate such policy convergence. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with key informants engaged in EU-China dialogues on the topic. Our findings suggest that, despite political signals from high-level Chinese leadership, it is unlikely that China will adopt trade measures requiring ‘deforestation free’ commodities in the foreseeable future. China's foreign policy stance of non-interference and concerns about its food security are key obstacles. While this limits the prospects of policy convergence in the short to medium term, a mix of market-based forces and cooperative mechanisms enabled by the EU regulation may lower the barriers and costs for companies to expand compliance with zero deforestation standards to other markets such as China, making some level of ‘de facto’ convergence plausible. We also note the importance of moving beyond a unilateral ‘Brussels Effect’ framing to consider the role of diplomacy, cooperation, and geopolitical conditions that promote, or run counter to, policy convergence. © 2024 The Authors",About Sufficiency

For many scholars and practitioners, this kind of private regulation and global standard-setting can provide an alternative to regulation by territorially bound, gridlocked, or incapacitated nation states, potentially improving environments and working conditions around the world and protecting the rights of exploited workers, impoverished farmers, and marginalized communities. But can private, voluntary rules actually create meaningful forms of regulation? Are forests and factories around the world being made into sustainable ecosystems and decent workplaces? Can global norms remake local orders? This book provides striking new answers by comparing the private regulation of land and labor in democratic and authoritarian settings. Case studies of sustainable forestry and fair labor standards in Indonesia and China show not only how transnational standards are implemented “on the ground” but also how they are constrained and reconfigured by domestic governance. Combining rich multi-method analyses, a powerful comparative approach, and a new theory of private regulation, this book reveals the contours and contradictions of transnational governance. © Tim Bartley 2018.",About Sufficiency
Infrastructure and rural development: Household perceptions on rural development,"This paper proposes a household model that relates various development interventions, such as infrastructure, to rural development. The model is then estimated using data from a household survey in which rural development outcomes are measured in terms of a perception scale. Household perceptions are important early lead indicators of rural development outcomes that manifest later. Rural poverty is linked to the exposure of the households to economic vulnerability, through their chronic dependence on agriculture for income generation. A starting point in mitigating this vulnerability would be a comprehensive improvement in accessibility. This would substantially reduce transportation cost and thereby lessen the isolation of rural communities from basic welfare services. An advocacy campaign and/or incentive system would be needed to encourage private firms to establish operations in rural areas. More private establishments in rural areas would not only shield households against exposure to vulnerability, but would also serve as a catalyst for microenterprise development. Sustainable rural development would follow, provided that there was an ample corporate social responsibility programme among these firms to avert a widening of inequality. A natural resource management strategy would also be needed for ecological integrity. Community participation is crucial in identifying development projects; it can help to minimise the wastage of resources on inappropriate projects, and enable resources to be allocated instead it to other productive uses. The provision of rural roads should be bundled properly with support services and capacity-building activities. This can enhance the demand for other infrastructure and services, resulting in a dynamic evolution of essential elements in the pursuit of rural development. Bundles of intervention improve the production efficiency of rural households at the different stages of production, both on and off the farm. Rural development interventions should pay special attention to the more vulnerable segments of the community, especially, the farmers. Interventions should aim gradually to detach them from complete dependence on agriculture, without putting their food security at risk. Public investments in infrastructure and in users' fees can complement each other, in the continuous provision of new infrastructure and the maintenance of existing infrastructure, to create a sustainable track towards rural development. The socialised users' fee system is a potential tool for preventing widening income disparity in rural areas. The careful selection of a suitable and acceptable basis for the socialised users' fee rate is important, however. An incorrect choice of rate could be perceived as a disincentive to access or might stimulate distrust among a segment of the rural society, regarding the government's sincerity in promoting rural development. This might eventually create more social issues, rather than bridging inequality. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
"Can’t get there from here: attainable distance, sustainable intensification and full-scale technical potential","Full-scale technical potential provides a clear horizon for agricultural technology policy to meet the dual and urgent challenge of meeting food security and minimising the effects of climate change. A common stated goal is to double food production by 2050 to meet the needs of 9 billion people. The frontier of full-scale technical potential embodies this goal and provides a panacea for policy makers. However, the pathway between the present adoption of technologies towards this frontier is paved with some hazards which may be insurmountable. We develop a conceptual framework based on adoption levels of technology. The key criteria between current and potential adoption of technologies is the role of enablers, that is interventions which create changes in structural, distributional, technical, social and behavioural cultures. Policy must find optimal mixtures of regulation and voluntary mechanisms to fully encourage uptake of technologies and shift current adoption to meet full-scale technical potential. A range of technologies can be aligned with sustainable intensification and are examined in terms of this enabler framework. Further examination of the framework allows us to conclude that full-scale technical potential will never be achieved due to the stochastic nature of agricultural production, the diversity of motivations and institutional structures operating within food supply chains, as well as unbalanced cost-effectiveness criteria. We argue that sustainable intensification may provide a direction of travel for attaining food security but its poor conception, limited acceptability and understanding amongst the communities of interest lead to over-optimism in determining the journey to this final destination. © 2016, The Author(s).",About Sufficiency

Climate Change Responses and Sustainable Development: Integration of Mitigation and Adaptation,"The recent progress in the study of climate change impacts and responses signifies the value of integrating adaptation and mitigation. Now, the focus is not limited to the responses of climate change, rather shifting to linking the climate change responses to sustainable development for overarching the human well-being. Integration of mitigation and adaptation responses can generate mutual tangible and intangible benefits and co-benefits with sustainable development. This integration would facilitate to the UN General Assembly the 2030 development agenda titled ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ through 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). These goals are incapacitated by a number of daunting problems such as inequality, conflicts, rapid urbanization, persistent pockets of poverty and hunger. Climate change is one of the major stressors challenging the competency to attain the ecological, economic and social objectives that outline the SDGs. Climate change, as a major stressor, is responsible for impacting directly and indirectly the multiple stressors such as food security, migration, biodiversity. Low carbon growth, resource efficiency and social inclusivity are paramount to sustainable development, and mitigation and adaptation to climate change may provide pathways to achieve the targets of SDGs. The holistic and integrated approach along with multidimensional and extensive research results can cast an informational basis for making decisions and choices targeting to achieve the sustainable development goals. Therefore, solution to climate change, that is, mitigation and adaptation, is pivotal for a sustainable future. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",About Sufficiency
"Sustainable finance, natural resource abundance, and energy poverty trap: the environmental challenges in the era of COVID-19","Energy poverty is a global challenge and the scarcity has been emerging as a global issue. Therefore, the relationship among energy scarcity, sustainable finance, and carbon emissions is analyzed with the help of global data from 40 developing countries until the beginning of the COVID-19 era. For empirical results’ estimation, the study analyzed a panel data ranging from 2000 to 2019. To measure the energy poverty, some part of population that has no access to energy is considered, and empirical analysis based on augmented mean group (AMG) regression method was carried out. The findings of the study suggest the inverse relation among energy poverty and carbon emissions. Moreover, a negative relationship was also observed between sustainable finance and carbon emissions. These findings highlight that alleviation of energy poverty can intensify environmental pollution. While improvement in access to clean energy will benefit society by alleviating energy poverty and controlling carbon emissions. Moreover, improvement in the share of sustainable finance in total investment may improve the environment quality by reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, it is suggested that regional plans along with sustainable finance are required on a priority basis for the promotion of clean energy to control carbon emissions and alleviate energy poverty at the household level. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",About Sufficiency
The energy-extractives nexus and the just transition,"The concept of a ‘just transition’ to a low-carbon economy is firmly embedded in mainstream global discourses about mitigating climate change. Drawing on Karl Polanyi's political economy elaborated in The Great Transformation, we interrogate the idea of a just transition and place it within its historical context. We address a major contradiction at the core of global energy transition debates: the rapid shift to low-carbon energy-systems will require increased extraction of minerals and metals. In doing so, we argue that extractive industries are energy and carbon-intensive, and will enlarge and intensify social and ecological injustice. Our findings reveal the importance of understanding how the idea of a just transition is used, and by who, and the type of justice that underpins this concept. We demonstrate the need to ground just transition policies and programmes in a notion of justice as fairness. © 2021 The Authors.

Emission regulations,"Emission regulations provide a fundamental framework for improving environmental quality, protecting public health, and addressing the global issue of climate change. Environmental regulations directly and indirectly affect industries, create incentives for technological innovation, and promote sustainable development. These are implemented as government policies aimed at reducing the adverse impacts of anthropogenic activities on the environment. Environmental policies are designed to control and manage emissions, promote natural resource conservation, and encourage sustainable practices across economic sectors. There is a voluminous literature on climate change and climate change policies, spanning across many disciplines of scholarship including economics, climatology, chemistry, political science, engineering, and more. This entry is focused only on providing a very general overview of the types of economic policy approaches that have been considered in an effort to deal with climate change. © Michael D.

"Finance, poverty-income inequality, energy consumption and the CO2 emissions nexus in Africa","Purpose: This study provides the critical masses (thresholds) at which the positive incidence of finance and economic growth will be dampened by the negative effects of income inequality and poverty on energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa for policy direction. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed the two steps systems GMM estimator for 41 countries in Africa from 2005–2020. Findings: The study found that for finance to maintain a positive effect on energy consumption per capita, the critical thresholds for the income inequality indicators (Atkinson coefficient, Gini index and the Palma ratio) should not exceed 0.681, 0.582 and 5.991, respectively. Similarly, for economic growth (GDP per capita growth) to maintain a positive effect on energy consumption per capita, the critical thresholds for the income inequality indicators (Atkinson coefficient, Gini index and the Palma ratio) should not exceed 0.669, 0.568 and 6.110, respectively. On the poverty level in Sub-Saharan Africa, the study reports that the poverty headcount ratios (hc$144ppp2011, hc$186ppp2011 and hc$250ppp2005) should not exceed 7.342, 28.278 and 129.332, respectively for financial development to maintain a positive effect on energy consumption per capita. The study also confirms the positive nexus between access to finance (financial development) and energy consumption per capita, with the attending adverse effect on CO2 emissions inescapable. The findings of this study make it evidently clear, for policy recommendation that finance is at the micro-foundation of economic growth, income inequality and poverty alleviation. However, a maximum threshold of income inequality and poverty headcount ratios as indicated in this study must be maintained to attain the full positive ramifications of financial development and economic growth on energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa. Originality/value: The originality of this study is found in the computation of the threshold and net effects of poverty and income inequality in economic growth through the conditional and unconditional effects of finance. © 2022, Michael Asiedu, Nana Adwoa Anokye Effah and Emmanuel Mensah Aboagye.",About Sufficiency
The socioeconomic future of deltas in a changing environment,"Deltas are especially vulnerable to climate change given their low-lying location and exposure to storm surges, coastal and fluvial flooding, sea level rise and subsidence. Increases in such events and other circumstances are contributing to the change in the environmental conditions in the deltas, which translates into changes in the productivity of ecosystems and, ultimately, into impacts on livelihoods and human well-being. Accordingly, climate change will affect not only the biophysical conditions of deltaic environments but also their economic circumstances. Furthermore, these economic implications will spill over to other regions through goods and services supply chains and via migration. In this paper we take a wider view about some of the specific studies within this Special Issue. We analyse the extent to which the biophysical context of the deltas contributes to the sustainability of the different economic activities, in the deltas and in other regions. We construct a set of environmental-extended multiregional input-output databases and Social Accounting Matrices that are used to trace the flow of provisioning ecosystem services across the supply chains, providing a view of the links between the biophysical environment and the economic activities. We also integrate this information into a Computable General Equilibrium model to assess how the changes in the provision of natural resources due to climate change can potentially affect the economies of the deltas and linked regions, and how this in turn affects economic vulnerability and sustainability in these regions. © 2018",About Sufficiency

Agro-food systems and environment: Sustaining the unsustainable,"Ecological footprints have made it possible to study the dependence on natural resources and the human impact derived from the substantial growth of the world population. Food security represents the sufficient and stable availability of food, with timely and stable access for future generations. Food security is an essential issue for agri-food systems that have been greatly affected by the demand for food, the current problems of sustainability, the high losses of food and waste generated in the production and supply chain, the limitations of natural resources and climate change. The circular economy still being a model of production and consumption under the reuse and recycling of materials for as long as possible to face the challenges of climate change, resource depletion and population growth. Currently, there is a need to adopt a political strategy of gradual transition and full integration of the different world entities from the different political sectors to achieve a sustainable and balanced food system with environmental, economic, and social sustainability. This review highlights the need to change the unsustainability of various in-practice agri-food systems and their interactions with the environment. Further, considering the Sustainable Development Goals of United Nations, insightful perspectives have been given to preserve and enhance sustain the agro-food systems and reduce the environmental impact for global sustainable food security. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",About Sufficiency
Development of efficient production and processing of forest products,"Major socio-economic benefits provided by forests include the promotion of efficient production and processing of forest products, along with the associated reduction of volume of waste and its reuse. This study begins with the description of how socio-economic benefits are related to the welfare or well-being of the population and the indication that forests can be promoted in two main ways: the first is to generate industry earnings (production benefits), while the second is to bring consumption of forest products in accordance with basic human needs or in improving living conditions in a different way (consumer benefits). The remaining analysis is aimed at assessing some of these benefits from two perspectives: the amount of benefits received and the number of people receiving such benefits. The kinds of socio-economic benefits from using forests are generalized, which is based on information available from national censuses, largescale surveys and other sources providing a sufficient level of data reliability. In the case of kinds of the production benefits, the values provided in the table should be considered as an estimated minimum, which is due to the lack of information on a number of products and countries. Values for the consumer benefits are generally more reliable but limited in the kinds of benefits. In particular, despite showing how forests directly contribute to meeting basic needs, they do not include many of the less obvious kinds of benefits from using forests (e.g. environmental services) that can also help meet the indicated needs or otherwise enhance living conditions.

"Financial development, inclusive growth, and environmental quality: emerging markets perspective","The Sustainable Development Goals specifically goals 6,7, 8, 12, 13, 14 and 15 aim to prevent environmental degradation, promote biodiversity, reduce carbon emissions, improve energy consumption, and preserve the ecosystem to support inclusive economic development. This paper sought to explore the nexus between financial development (FD), inclusive growth, and environmental quality (EQ) in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) for the 1990–2018 period. Further, this study reconceptualizes the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve into the Financial Development Environmental Kuznets Curve (FDEKC) that explains the finance-environment relationship in varied economic development strata (High human development index—HHDI, Medium human development—MHDI, Lower human development index—LHDI) using two proxies of EQ: ecological footprint and CO2 emissions. The panel corrected standard error estimator by Beck and Katz (Am Polit Sci Rev 89(3):634–647, 1995) was used to estimate the models. The results suggest that (1) there is a non-linear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between FD and EQ (defined by ecological footprint) in both the HHDI and MHDI economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, FD improves EQ in LHDI economies both at the initial stage of FD and long term. (2) The nexus between FD and EQ (defined by CO2 emissions) is U-shaped in HHDI economies, an inverted U-shaped in LHDI economies, and deteriorating in MHDI economies (3) Inclusive growth, as defined by a holistic index, has a deteriorating effect on EQ (CO2 emissions) across all groups. However, while inclusive growth is inimical to EQ (ecological footprint) in MHDI economies, it improves EQ in LHDI economies. This study concludes that EQ assessment requires a tailor-made strategy that considers each country's particulars, including its resources and economic situation. Further, SSA countries should ensure equitable distribution of the advantages of economic growth and augment FD to improve and EQ. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",About Sufficiency
"BOOSTING SUSTAINABILITY AND HUMAN WELL-BEING: SYNERGISING GREEN INNOVATION, GREEN FINANCE AND HEALTH EXPENDITURE TO REDUCE VIETNAMESE CARBON EMISSION","Although Vietnam’s commitment to sustainability is quite evident due to its strategic adoption of sustainable practices, however, with significant economic expansion, the country has been facing significant environmental challenges in the form of deforestation, pollution, climate change and others. The scenario, thus, necessitates a multi-faceted approach to ensure long term sustainability. In this regard, the present study aims to assess green finance, environmental policy, green innovations, health expenditures, and human development in terms of sustainable development in the Vietnamese context. The study used time series data from 1995 to 2021 and analysed it through QARDL estimations. With significant results in the case of green finance, environmental policy, green innovations and health expenditures, the study suggests that environmental policies greatly help the country provide a regulatory framework that enforces green practices. Green innovation and green finance are also vital tools for the economy to drive economic growth by creating new sustainable paths and promoting funding for green projects. Findings also highlight the crucial role of effective health spending as it ensures that a healthier population is capable of participating in sustainable initiatives. Thus, this confirms the evident role of these synergetic factors in the country’s progress toward carbon neutrality. However, the insignificant relationship of human development with sustainable development can be an exciting debate, implying that sometimes careless policies aimed at carbon neutrality neglect socio-economic factors. Therefore, in light of the findings, the study recommends implementing strict environmental policies and promoting green innovation activities. It is also suggested that the policies of the health and education sector be revised to promote sustainability in Vietnam. © Vilnius University, 2002-2024 and Brno University of Technology, 2002-2024 and University of Latvia, 2002-2024.",About Sufficiency
"Agriculture and land use: Demand for and supply of agricultural commodities, characteristics of the farming and food industries, and implications for land use in the UK","Agriculture is the largest type of land use in the UK, accounting for about 77 per cent of the total area, compared with an average 50 per cent for the EU27. But in common with most high-income countries, agriculture's contribution to UK GDP and employment is low, at about 0.5 and 1.8 per cent, respectively, although the regional importance of the sector (and its associated food and farming industries) varies considerably. Of the 17.5 million ha used for agriculture, about 28 per cent is allocated to crops, and 67 per cent is grassland. The grassland includes 4.4 million ha of sole-owned rough grazing and 1.1 million ha of common land in mainly upland ""disadvantaged areas,"" primarily used for beef and sheep production. This has a major influence on land use, especially in the northern and western parts of the UK. From the 1930s until the mid-1980s, UK policy promoted increases in agricultural productivity to feed the nation from its own resources. An array of income and production support measures encouraged intensive farming, including a relative switch to arable farming in eastern areas. Since the early-1990s, policies have sought simultaneously to make UK agriculture internationally competitive and environmentally benign. These policies, evident in the Agenda 2000 Reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, point the way forward for the future. It is likely that a greater distinction will emerge between policies to protect natural resources and enhance the flow of non-market ecosystem services from rural land, and agriculture and food policies intended to encourage an appropriate proportion of national food requirements to be met from domestic sources. It seems likely that over the next 50 years, the UK's land area will be required to deliver an increasingly diverse range of private and public goods to meet growing human needs and aspirations. This will require a balance of policy-driven goals and market forces. It will also need a much improved understanding of the trade-offs between food production and environmental goals and of the institutional arrangements required to achieve a balance of economic, social and environmental outcomes. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.",About Sufficiency
Stranded nations? Transition risks and opportunities towards a clean economy,"The transition away from a fossil-fuel powered economy towards a cleaner production system will create winners and losers in the global trade system. We compile a list of ‘brown’ traded products whose use is highly likely to decline if the world is to mitigate climate change, and explore which countries are most at risk of seeing their productive capabilities ‘stranded’. Using methods from economic geography and complexity, we develop novel measures of transition risk that capture the extent to which countries’ export profiles are locked-in to brown products. We show that countries exporting a high number of brown products, especially technologically sophisticated ones, could find it relatively easy to transition. Conversely, countries with exports highly concentrated in a few, low-complexity brown products have much fewer nearby diversification opportunities. Our results suggest that export complexity and diversity play a key role in determining transition risk. Path-breaking diversification strategies are needed to prevent nations from becoming stranded. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd",About Sufficiency
When Are Carbon Border Adjustment Measures Just?,"Arguments in support of carbon border adjustment measures are often based on considerations of justice. Implementing carbon border adjustment measures would be necessary to, first, promote fair competition between corporations and, second, make carbon pricing instruments more effective and thus prevent the harms of dangerous climate change. Yet, both arguments tend to obscure considerations of distributive justice relative to the burdens of climate policies and the benefits of economic cooperation. In this article, we first explain why the case for carbon border adjustment measures based on the ideal of fair competition between corporations is flawed. Second, if the priority of harm avoidance over fair burden-sharing can justify carbon border adjustment measures, we argue that it does not justify all kinds of carbon border adjustment measures. On the contrary, it puts significant constraints on their design. We contend that just carbon border adjustment measures should include design features that allow for some form of carbon leakage risk, either via country-differentiated prices or via country-specific exemptions. © The Author(s) 2024.",About Sufficiency
Socio-economic impact of natural resource management: How environmental degradation affects the quality of life,"Sustainable development is guided by three pillars: the economy, society and the environment. Social consequences on health are shaped by economic systems and social structures, which are integrated with the larger environment and affect the global allocation of energy resources. This is the first research of its kind to examine the social and economic effects of environmental degradation changes while considering cross-sectional dependency. This article examines the effect of natural resource management policies and socioeconomic development on Asia's ecological footprint from 1995 to 2020, considering natural resources, population growth and industrial development. Our research shows that changes in the natural resources and ecological footprint have improved economic conditions and social outcomes, including human progress and income distribution. Two different outcomes of recent natural resource management are improved operational efficiency and decreased environmental degradation. Our findings hold up even considering other possible model specifications considering the interaction impacts of power sector changes.

A simultaneous equations approach to analyze the sustainable water-energy-food nexus in South Korea,"Factors such as climate change, economic development, population growth, pandemics, and geopolitical instability threaten water, energy, and food (WEF) security, which consequently put sustainability at risk. However, studies that simultaneously consider WEF security and sustainability aspects still need improvement. This research aimed to build a sustainable WEF nexus framework and analyze the interrelationships among water consumption, electricity demand, food production, and ecological footprint, considering the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and external factors of the WEF nexus. For the empirical analysis, this study employed the three-stage least squares method to identify synergies and trade-offs in the sustainable WEF nexus in South Korea using panel data from 2005 to 2019. The results indicated that rice production causes excessive use of agricultural water, thereby deteriorating water availability and quality. This phenomenon leads to scarce water resources and environmental degradation, which negatively impact energy production and sustainability. Although increased agricultural productivity through automation improves food security, it can pose a threat to energy security by increasing electricity demand and energy imports. The EKC hypothesis test revealed that environmental problems cannot be solved through economic development. However, the indicators related to WEF security influence environmental sustainability rather than economic growth. These results indicate that WEF security and sustainability can be improved simultaneously by maximizing synergies and minimizing trade-offs within a sustainable WEF nexus. Therefore, this research provides a roadmap for policymakers regarding efficient ways to improve environmental quality and WEF security. © 2023 The Author(s).

Food security effects of forest sector participation in rural Liberia,"Forests can help rural households cope with food insecurity challenges in the face of climate change while also sequestering carbon and advancing other sustainability objectives in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). As such, participation in the forestry sector can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially on hunger and food security (SDG 2) in forest rich, but economically poor areas of LMICs. However, analysis of the effects of forest sector participation on food security in such contexts remain limited. Here we estimate the effects of participation in forest-based activities like collection and processing of timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) on household food security in Liberia, the most forested country in West Africa. We applied endogenous switching poisson regression to data from 1408 households living in the proximity of forests included in Liberia’s 2019 national household forest survey to estimate the effect of forest sector participation on food security (in terms of reduction in the number of months households reportedly had insufficient food). Results show that forest-sector participation reduced the number of months households had insufficient food by 84% (about 2.7 months). Heterogeneity analyses show that NTFPs affected food security by 80% (about 2.5 months) compared to timber and wood products, which had a 66% effect size (about 2.1 months) on average. Our results provide new, national-scale evidence on the role of forests in enhancing food security in Liberia and suggest the importance of forest sector participation for food security and achieving SDG 2 more generally. © The Author(s) 2024.",About Sufficiency
Creating a Responsible Renewable Energy Investment Model for the MENA Region's Low-Carbon Transition,"Addressing climate change presents specific challenges for the countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), particularly concerning oil production and water scarcity, but it also offers opportunities for new paths toward sustainability. The transition to low-carbon energy raises significant concerns for oil and gas producers in the MENA region, especially regarding their dependence on hydrocarbon revenues. Without proper adjustments, this transition could worsen macroeconomic imbalances and potentially threaten existing social contracts. Policymakers are working to promote various renewable energy sources and implementation strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. As a result, the development of an index capable of accurately measuring and benchmarking a country's overall sustainability and economic performance becomes essential. This index should provide a comprehensive assessment of both the current and future state of renewable energy. Additionally, it must highlight key environmental, social, governance (ESG), and economic factors within the renewable energy sector. This proposal aims to establish a composite index, referred to as the Renewable Energy Responsible Investment Index (RERII), covering 19 countries and utilizing 22 distinct metrics. The RERII trend is calculated from 2010 to 2019. The proposed index can serve as a screening tool, decision-making aid, benchmarking instrument, and guide for sustainable development. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

"Robotics technology: catalyst for sustainable development—impact on innovation, healthcare, inequality, and economic growth","Robotics technology transforms industries by driving sustainable development, improving healthcare delivery, decreasing inequality, and promoting economic growth. Through innovation and automation, robotics fosters inclusivity and efficiency, empowering underserved communities while tackling global challenges in line with the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs). Despite extensive research on robotics' impacts on sustainable development goals (SDGs), there is limited focus on how these technologies influence Healthcare, innovation, inequality, and economic growth, particularly in developing nations. This study uses a systematic literature review to enhance understanding of robotics as a catalyst for sustainable development. Findings show that SDGs' economic and Healthcare aspects are well-studied, representing 17% of the literature, with innovation at 18.9%, inequality at 9.4%, and SDG 8 at 3.8%. Other SDG aspects account for 34% of the research. The literature emphasizes the role of automation and robotics in achieving ecologically and economically aligned SDGs, particularly in sustainable Healthcare, where robotics can improve medication management in home care. However, many areas in robotics applications remain underexplored, indicating a need for further research to bridge existing gaps. There are untapped opportunities to leverage new tools to accelerate the achievement of global SDGs, particularly for deepening and expanding current efforts. SDG 8 remains under investigated. This study proposes a conceptual framework for sustainable technologies to advance SDG achievement. The findings underscore the critical role of robotics in advancing SDGs, especially in innovation and Healthcare, though highlighting gaps in economic growth and inequality research.

Achieving Global Food Security: The Caribbean Experience and Beyond,"This book examines the current food security challenges in the small states with a focus on the Caribbean. The work is in the conjuncture of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global shocks, including the disruption in the global supply chains and the increase in climate-related events. These events have led to an increase in global prices, including the price of food and fertilisers. This book starts by examining the global food security crisis considering the aftereffects of the shocks, then provides a macro-overview of the region by focusing on its ability to invest in agriculture. The results indicate that private sector investment in agriculture has experienced only a slight increase despite creeping inflation. This has exacerbated vulnerabilities in food security, which deteriorated in 2020, undoing nearly a decade of progress in the face of climate change. Detailed attention is paid to food vulnerabilities in 14 Caribbean countries. In the final chapter, a series of policy measures are outlined to strengthen the region's food security position, with a particular focus on innovation and the region's comparative advantages. © 2025 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

"A review of studies on green finance of banks, research gaps and future directions","With growing global concern for environmental protection, climate change and sustainable development, policymakers and researchers have recently focused on green finance. In this study, existing studies on green finance in the context of the banking sector have been reviewed with considerations on products and determinants of green finance. The content analysis approach has been used to critically analyse and summarize forty-six (46) relevant studies. The results found green securities, green investments, climate finance, carbon finance, green insurance, green credit and green infrastructural bonds as part of key green finance products of banks. Pertinent determinants the study found to be influencing green finance policies from banks include environmental and climate change policies, interest rates, religion, risks, social inclusion and social justice as well as banking regulations. In theory, this study provides a guide for further studies. The results of the study will assist banks on the key issues to consider in adopting, developing and granting green finance. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",About Sufficiency
The moderating effect of foreign direct investment on environmental degradation-poverty reduction nexus: evidence from sub-Saharan African countries,"This study examined the role played by foreign direct investment in environmental degradation-poverty reduction nexus using panel data from 39 sub-Saharan Africa countries. The study covered the period 1986–2018, while dynamic GMM was employed for the estimations. When poverty reduction was measured by household final consumption expenditure, it was found that the interaction between foreign direct investment and environmental degradation measures failed to contribute to poverty reduction. However, when poverty reduction was measured by the human development index, it was found that the interaction of foreign direct investment and environmental degradation enhanced poverty reduction. When poverty reduction was measured by life expectancy, the interaction term of FDI and carbon dioxide (CO2) was harmful to poverty reduction, while the interaction terms of FDI with other measures of environmental degradation had no effect on poverty reduction. The implications of the study were discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",About Sufficiency
"Feminization, food security, and hunger eradication: A Case of Omu-Aran community in Kwara State, Nigeria","A profound change of the global food and agriculture system is needed if we are to nourish today's 795 million hungry and the expected 2 billion people by 2050. Aside from hunger and malnutrition, food insecurity results in a wide range of problems such as health, environmental degradation, and a high rate of crime. When food security improves, most facets of life improve as well. While most Nigerians engaged in activities outside the agricultural sector, the country is in danger of being engulfed in a food crisis. Improving agriculture and food security (being able to produce enough food to sustain families and communities year after year), is a herculean task for the Omu-Aran community. There are no incentives for women to engage in commercial agriculture. Based on the above, this study tends to examine the role of women in proving food security and how this could help in the eradication of hunger in the Omu-Aran community in Kwara State. It argues that women have more restricted access than men to productive resources and opportunities including land, livestock, inputs, education, extension and research services, and financial services. Closing this gender gap would give an important boost to agricultural productivity and output, and in bringing agricultural yields similar to those of men, government at all levels, as well as corporate and financial establishments, must commit a large chunk of resources towards motivating women farmers. Role theory provides the theoretical framework for the study. The design for the study was both descriptive and exploratory. A two-stage sampling consisting of purposive and simple random techniques were used to select the respondents. The sample population comprises 35 food crop farming households in the Omu-Aran community. A structured interview was used to elicit information on the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. Twenty-five in-depth interviews were conducted. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively while qualitative data was content analyses. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",About Sufficiency
The ‘state’ of degrowth: Economic growth and the making of state hegemony in Turkey,"Critical perspectives on economic growth have laid bare the fragility of the assumed link between material growth and socio-ecological wellbeing. The appeal of economic growth, however, goes beyond the economic sphere. As a societal goal, growth is often mobilized to pre-empt and/or co-opt opposition around issues of social justice and redistribution. Not only does the constitution of growth as a collective goal serve to unite the internally fragmented sphere of the social and brush aside (class-based) distributional conflicts, but it also enables the distribution of material concessions to subordinate classes for eliciting their consent. The degrowth proposal should thus more broadly tackle the material and discoursive ways in which growth enables the reproduction of contemporary political-economic systems. This paper argues that the notion of growth functions as a powerful ideal that shapes state–society relationships and social-collective imaginations. It demonstrates this by discussing the making of state in Turkey through a Gramscian perspective, where the notion of economic growth is deeply imprinted in the broader practices of the state to legitimize its existence and dominates the social imaginary in a way that cannot be easily dismissed. Against this backdrop, the possibility of not only effectuating, but also imagining and desiring degrowth would call for a radical reconfiguration of state–society relationships. Within this context, the Kurdish Freedom Movement’s project of Democratic Economy emerges as an alternative, both to the nation-state paradigm and to the imperative of economic growth. © The Author(s) 2019.",About Sufficiency
Agricultural sector performance and a green revolution in Africa: An overview,"It is broadly recognised that vigorous agricultural growth is essential for African development, both in support of aggregate economic growth and a structural transformation of the economy towards industrialisation, and of poverty reduction and improved food security. For the first, this is because agriculture is a large sector, with important multiplier effects on other sectors of the economy, competitive advantage given the current state of institutional development, and is necessary to support internationally competitive labour costs for the rest of the economy due to incomplete tradability of food. For the second, this is because a vast majority of the poor are rural people who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, and access to food importantly depends on local production. Yet, this achievement has largely been elusive, with Africa still to achieve a Green Revolution as other continents have done. Fundamental questions are thus: Why this has been the case? How could a Green Revolution be engineered? And what are some of the emerging opportunities and hurdles in securing success? These are the questions addressed by the papers contained in this volume. Together the papers argue that new opportunities exist to make a Green Revolution for Africa possible but that greater attention must be given to the design and testing of new approaches that correspond to the specific conditions of Africa and the corresponding development of human capacity (de Janvry and Sadoulet); that the release of profitable new technologies will be the driving force inducing the necessary institutional changes and public investments in agriculture as it did in Asia (Otsuka and Kijima); that the hurdles of adverse OECD farm policies, property rights on new biological technologies and concentration of market power in integrated value chains must be addressed and removed (Oyejide); and that adapting the Green Revolution to climate change is a huge new challenge that will require large investments to reduce vulnerability to warming and extreme weather events and to enhance farmers' capacity to respond (Hassan). © The author 2010.

THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF HEALTH AND DEGROWTH,"It is not possible to promote and protect global population health within a system based on economic growth. In fact, a socio-economic model primarily oriented toward growth, after a certain threshold, becomes counter-productive: over time, its advantages decrease exponentially until its negative effects outweigh its positive ones. Health is not immune from this process. Growth is based on the indiscriminate exploitation of natural and human capital: undermining the principal determinants of health via producing increasing damage to the environment, greater inequalities, and unhealthy consumerist cultures and lifestyles. This chapter makes the case that degrowth represents a radical alternative to the current political-economic system and its hegemonic orientation toward growth. It outlines how degrowth favors democratically led redistributive initiatives that engender production and consumption downscaling in industrialized countries to secure objectives of environmental sustainability, social justice, and welfare. Accordingly, the socio-economic and cultural changes promoted by degrowth would have substantial positive repercussions for planetary health, and provide the prerequisites to implement several fundamental health policies that remain largely proscribed in existing neoliberal and capitalist systems. In turn, by applying degrowth principles to the health field, the chapter presents the outline of an alternative model of medicine and health systems. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, David Primrose, Rodney Loeppky and Robin Chang; individual chapters, the contributors.",About Sufficiency
Energy system improvement planning under drought condition based on a two-stage optimization model: The desire for sustainability through the promoting of system's resilience,"Energy is one of the most important social and economic infrastructures and human life is strongly depends on it. In recent years, the occurrence of natural disasters such as drought as a high-impact low-probability event is undeniable. So, energy planning in the disruption situation is necessary in order to anticipate and maintain the performance of the energy system in optimal condition. This paper focuses on developing a hybrid long-term framework for evaluating the energy system resilience based on sustainability concept against drought. The model bridges the gap between long-term energy system planning in macro level and short-term switching operations or micro level modeling​ approach in response to drought resulted by climate change. The new resilience indexes are used to maximize the social welfare, to minimize the energy needed but not supplied (ENNS), to recover the system performance rapidly and minimum the total cost of the energy system after occurring drought. When disaster happens, the modeling of energy systems will do through two stages because the behavior of the system should be considered, compare and analyzed before and after disruption events. On the other hand, the system uncertainties, possible futures and different strategies can change the optimal path of the energy needed supply, which is examined by scenario analysis in the proposed model. So, the developed model is a two-stage optimization model with linear programming approach and scenario analyzing model with a combination of back-casting and forward future approaches Numerical model is performed on UTOPIA energy system and its results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021",About Sufficiency
Climate Change: New Challenges and Unexpected Threats - the Iraqi Case,"The European Green Deal (EGD) aims to achieve a green transition and make the European Union climate-neutral in 2050. In this regard, the EGD has various implications for fossil fuel producers, and the cost of a just transition is very high for fossil fuel-dependent economies, particularly producers in the developing World. As in the 21st century, global concerns about CO2 emission, pursuing a green economy, economic development, climate change, and environmental pollution have become serious challenges for developed and developing worlds. In this chapter, we consider a comparative analysis of the EU Green Deal and fossil fuel economies, particularly oil-producing economies such as Iraq. Based on the content analyses, the empirical findings reveal that the EGD transformed Europe’s energy needs and dependence. At the same time, it brings severe economic challenges for fossil fuel economies. Based on the findings, this chapter suggests a few policy implications for fossil fuel producers in the light of EGD to tackle the shared challenges based on shared responsibility and securing a just transition for all since boosting economic development while keeping CO2 emissions low requires better cooperation and support from and with the EU. To adapt environmental policies properly, fossil fuel economies are required to consider the European political role in creating a shared responsibility for environmental consciousness applicability in regional environmental initiatives. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Marjorie Tendero and Christoph Weber; individual chapters, the contributors.",About Sufficiency
"Natural Resources Depletion, Financial Risk, and Human Well-Being: What is the Role of Green Innovation and Economic Globalization?","Human well-being is the top priority of all nations in the twenty-first century. However, depletion of natural resources and financial risk can negatively impact human well-being, which in turn can make it difficult to realize human well-being. Also, green innovation and economic globalization may play a significant role in human well-being. In this context, this study assesses the impacts of natural resources, financial risk, green innovation, and economic globalization on human well-being in emerging countries from 1990 to 2018. The empirical results from the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimator unveiled that natural resources and financial risk negatively affect the human well-being of emerging nations. Furthermore, the results show that green innovation and economic globalization positively contribute to human well-being. These findings are also verified using alternative methods. In addition, natural resources, financial risk, and economic globalization Granger cause human well-being but not the other way round. Furthermore, bidirectional causality exists between green innovation and human well-being. Considering these novel findings, sustainable utilization of natural resources and controlling financial risk are necessary strategies for realizing human well-being. More resources should be allocated for green innovation, and government should encourage economic globalization to attain sustainable development in emerging countries.

Resource management as a key factor for sustainable urban planning,"Due to fast urbanization and increasing living standards, the environmental sustainability of our global society becomes more and more questionable. In this historical review we investigate the role of resources management (RM) and urban planning (UP) and propose ways for integration in sustainable development (SD). RM follows the principle of circular causation, and we reflect on to what extent RM has been an element for urban planning. Since the existence of the first settlements, a close relationship between RM, urbanization and technological development has been present. RM followed the demand for urban resources like water, energy, and food. In history, RM has been fostered by innovation and technology developments and has driven population growth and urbanization. Recent massive resource demand, especially in relation to energy and material flows, has altered natural ecosystems and has resulted in environmental degradation. UP has developed separately in response to different questions. UP followed the demand for improved living conditions, often associated to safety, good manufacturing and trading conditions and appropriate sanitation and waste management. In history UP has been a developing research area, especially since the industrial era and the related strong urbanization at the end of the 18th century. UP responded to new emerging problems in urban areas and became increasingly complex. Nowadays, UP has to address many objectives that are often conflicting, including, the urban sustainability. Our current urban un-sustainability is rooted in massive resource consumption and waste production beyond natural limits, and the absence of flows from waste to resources. Therefore, sustainable urban development requires integration of RM into UP. We propose new ways to this integration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",About Sufficiency
Common property theory and resource governance institutions: Strengthening explanations of multiple outcomes,"Different strategies to govern resource commons generate outcomes that can be assessed along different dimensions, in terms of the ecological or social sustainability of the resource system, contributions to the livelihoods of those who rely on these resources, or equity in the allocation of benefits. This paper reviews the existing literature concerning three major renewable resource commons, namely pasture lands, fisheries and irrigation water. Most existing work on these commons has been inattentive to the multiple outcomes that management of all renewable resources generates. Studies of commons can provide better information about livelihoods, sustainability and equity dimensions of natural resource governance outcomes than previously. Attending to the distinctive determinants and drivers of these outcomes and the nature of trade-offs and synergies among them has the potential to advance common property theory substantially. Possible relationships among livelihoods, sustainability and equity are identified, and the major explanations of outcomes advanced by scholars of fisheries, pastoral and irrigation commons reviewed. An interdisciplinary approach is needed to improve existing efforts to determine the outcomes that resource commons generate. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2011.",About Sufficiency
Socio-hydrological agent-based modelling for analysing the impacts of supply enhancement strategies on the cap-and-trade scheme,"An agent-based model (ABM) is developed to explore the socio-hydrological and economic impacts of a water transfer project, as a supply enhancement strategy, on the cap-and-trade scheme, as a demand-side management practice, in Rafsanjan Plain, Iran. The modelling scheme benefits from a distributed groundwater model coupled with a socio-economic ABM to explore the social and economic impacts of the proposed supply enhancement and demand management strategies. The main goal of the integrated model is to investigate how the supply enhancement strategies and the cap-and-trade policy can bring about more favourable hydrological, social, and economic results in the recipient basin. Findings indicate that integration of the supply augmentation and the cap-and-trade policy can facilitate the emergence of collective action in the farmer society. It is shown that the combination of these two policies, when implemented to mitigate water scarcity, reduces economic costs incurred on both farmers and the government and brings about more favourable socio-hydrological outcomes. © 2021 IAHS.",About Sufficiency
Implications of Global Climatic Change on Water and Food Security,"Water availability, access, and use has ensured food and livelihood security for millions. In the future, food and livelihood security may be challenged due to global environmental changes, particularly global climatic changes, that evidence has gradually shown to be appearing. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected that the global mean surface temperature will rise by 1.4–5.8°C by 2100 due to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Climate variability is also projected to increase, leading to uncertainty in the onset of monsoons and more frequent extreme weather events, such as more severe droughts and floods. These environmental changes are known to affect all aspects of the hydrological cycle, which in turn may alter the balance between food demand and supply in time and space in many parts of the world. Regions such as South Asia and Africa are expected to be particularly vulnerable to these environmental changes due to their large population, predominance of agriculture, and limited resource base. The potential impact of climatic changes on the quality of fruits, vegetables, cereals and medicinal plants can have a negative impact on emerging trade opportunities for these commodities in many countries. To ensure future water and food security, greater attention is now needed on adaptations to climatic change, which calls for increased diversification, improved land use and natural resource management policies, increased use of biofuels, improved risk management through early warning systems and crop insurance, and wastewater recycling in agriculture. © 2010, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",About Sufficiency
Is saving the non-renewable resources worthwhile? Evidence of paradox of plenty on human capital development,"This study highlights the resource curse attached to the renewable energy abundance in low middle income countries. Renewable energy abundance diverts the focus of policies and investments from human capital development to the export of energy to high income countries who aim to diversify their energy mix for sustainable growth. This study analyses 76 low-middle income countries from 2010 to 2021 for energy curse channeled through low human capital development in the long run. This study incorporates the renewable energy curse into a Cobb-Douglas function and uses Index for human capital as a proxy for human capital development in a pooled fixed effects model. The results align with the expected hypotheses that renewable energy abundance negatively impacts human capital development, persistently, while we control for technology, infrastructure, health, energy poverty and FDI. The results call for policy implications that may help these countries to seek development in skill development, technological progress, manufacturing of renewable energy equipment and transparency of institutions as a strategy to cope up with the curse in the long run. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",About Sufficiency
"Planning for Sustainable Cities in Africa: Experiences, Challenges and Prospects of Monitoring Geospatial Indicators","The African continent is receiving unprecedented pressure from population growth, urbanisation, decreased agricultural productivity and changing climate. However, the continent lacks technological advancement. Therefore, there is a need to apply global data and open geospatial tools for analysis to prevent, stop and comprehend the trend and effects of land degradation, food insecurity and the unsustainability of cities. The study takes three representative indicators (climate risk, land degradation and land consumption) from FAO’s four strategic better’s to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of global datasets to support decision makers. Three representative cities in Africa are selected for the study—Houet, Burkina Faso (West Africa); Kisumu, Kenya (East Africa); and Analamanga, Madagascar (South East Africa). The study found that eight Fokontany of the Analamanga region were at high risk from climate change; at the ward level, a maximum of 54.2% of the total degraded land area in Kisumu; and maximum land-consumption rate of 1.5 was found in Houet at the department level. The results of this study can be a basis for policymakers in planning an inclusive climate-adaptation measure and sustainable land-use frameworks and policies. © 2022 by the authors.

Measurement of composites index on low carbon development supporting food security,"Since the concept of low carbon development (LCD) was adopted at the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, Indonesia has been committed to implementing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, the country issued Presidential Regulation No. 18, which made LCD one of the national priority programs to maintain economic and social through low emission activities and reduce the overexploitation of natural resources. The LCD is a way for the country to overcome the tradeoff between economic growth and environmental degradation. Nevertheless, LCD is a new initiative for Indonesia, so it needs strategic indicators that influence the achievement of development. This paper attempts to integrate macro-regional development indicators that combine each region’s gross domestic product, human development index, and unemployment rate with LCD indicators, including the environmental quality index and g reenhouse gas emissions. The combined indicators were constructed by composite index through the Shannon entropy method, geometric and arithmetic means using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. The results show significant differences among provinces concerning to macro-regional indicators once the LCD indicators were incorporated. The results of this analysis could be used by policymakers to evaluate the green development of regions. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",About Sufficiency
"Effects of health expenditure, death rate, and infant mortality rate on life expectancy: A case study of the United States","Understanding the factors that influence life expectancy (LEXP) is crucial for promoting economic development, as a nation's prosperity depends on the health of its population. Various socioeconomic, nutritional, lifestyle, genetic, and environmental factors can significantly impact a nation’s health and longevity. Our study investigates these drivers of LEXP, focusing on the United States as a case study. Using quarterly data from 2000 to 2022, we examined the relationship between LEXP and multiple determinants, including environmental degradation, income levels, inflation dynamics, educational attainment, birth and death rates, health expenditure patterns, urbanization trends, and infant mortality rates. Employing advanced analytical methodologies, we accounted for the nonlinear nature of the time series data by utilizing approaches such as quantile-on-quantile Kernel Regression Least Squares and quantile-on-quantile Granger causality. The study revealed that factors such as inflation rate, rapid urbanization, high birth rates, CO2 emissions, death rates, and infant mortality negatively affect LEXP. On the other hand, higher income levels, educational attainment, food production, and health expenditure positively influence LEXP. Based on these findings, we have proposed significant policy recommendations. © The Author(s) 2024.",About Sufficiency

What climate-smart agriculture means to members of the Global Alliance for climate-smart agriculture,"Climate-smart agriculture (CSA), a concept originally coined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), has been presented as a solution to the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change. According to the FAO, CSA explicitly aims for three objectives: (1) to sustainably increase agricultural productivity to support equitable increases in farm incomes, food security and development; (2) to adapt and build resilience to climate change at multiple levels; and (3) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. This definition of CSA is central to ongoing debates between different groups of stakeholders, such as NGOs and policy-makers in developed and developing countries, over what exactly constitutes CSA, e.g. does it encompass large-scale industrial agriculture and small-scale agriculture, organic and non-organic farming practices, and which associated practices fall in its ambit. Thus, to frame CSA's efficacy for the future, it is important to explore how different groups of stakeholders define CSA. This study collects and analyses data from qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 30 active members of the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture (GACSA)-one of the most prominent organizations currently involved in shaping CSA policy. The interviewees include employees of governments, NGOs, research institutions, agribusiness companies and representatives of farmers' groups. Their responses reveal that for CSA practitioners within GACSA, doing CSA is perceived to be significantly more important than defining CSA or attempting to identify the differences between, for example, agroecology and CSA. Particularly challenging is to define what qualifies as ""smart"". Nevertheless, clarification of CSA is important for governments and policy-makers, in particular with regard to the use of inorganic fertilizers and GM technologies. Although these latter approaches are not explicitly promoted by GACSA, the membership of several ""Big Ag"" companies in the Alliance attracts criticism concerning the shaping of CSA's agenda and possible ""greenwashing"" by private interests. At the same time, the respondents note that some proponents of agroecology can be accused of ""claiming the space as their own."" Almost all interviewees stress the importance of a bottom-up approach based on shared governance and growth and placing farmers' needs first, rather than creating division among stakeholder groups. In addition, cooperation between farmers, researchers, and policymakers, as well as a context-specific approach to collaborative, data-driven education programmes are all cited as crucial for the future development of CSA. © 2019 University of Kassel.",About Sufficiency
"Examining volatility dynamics, spillovers and government water recovery in Murray-Darling Basin water markets","Although participation in water markets is widespread among irrigators in the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia, there has been a lack of study on the dynamics of water markets, in particular price and volume dynamics, volatility and spillovers. Questions have also been raised regarding the impact on markets from governments buying back permanent water from consumptive use to return to environmental use. VARX-BEKK-GARCH time-series regression was used to model the water market dynamics of monthly permanent and temporary water market trade from 1997 to 2017 in one of the largest water markets in the Murray-Darling Basin, the Goulburn-Murray Irrigation District. Results suggest that the temporary market was more volatile than the permanent narket, while persistency in volatility only exists in permanent markets. Unidirectional transmission spillovers exists in both markets from prices to volumes. The main drivers of temporary water prices were water scarcity related, while permanent prices were most significantly influenced by previous permanent water prices and current temporary water market prices. A statistically significant negative impact on temporary volume-traded from government water recovery (e.g. a 1% increase in water recovery resulted in a 0.14% reduction in water volume-traded) was found, but no significant impact from government recovery was found on temporary water prices, nor on permanent market prices and volumes. However, government water recovery increased the volatility of temporary market prices and volumes, signaling potential increased issues of risk and uncertainty for irrigators engaging in temporary water markets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Socio economy impact in relation to waste prevention,"Globally waste is driven by population and economic growth, and urbanization. One important instrument to meet this increasing demand and to decrease the pressure on food production is to minimize food loss, food waste, green waste, recycling waste and other wastes etc. It has been estimated that globally one third of the edible parts of food destined for human consumption is lost or wasted each year. Much of the waste that comes from high-income countries has been attributed to poor marketing practices and consumer behaviour, with consumers being identified as a bigger contributor than food manufacturing, distribution, grocery retail and the hospitality sectors. There are environmental as well as socio-economic, financial and legal reasons for being concerned about waste prevention which are: (i) Environmental reasons: Municipal waste is merely the final evidence of consumption which entails environmental footprints which are rarely sustainable; (ii) Socio-economic reasons: Production of waste appears to be the result of wasting natural resources and these resources are both limited and unequally distributed; (iii) Financial reasons: Reducing the quantities of waste produced means it should be possible to reduce the budget required for the collection, transportation and treatment of waste products; (iv) Legal reasons: The European framework directive on waste requires national waste prevention programmes to be drawn up. Waste prevention is performed in the privacy of our own home and is personal as it is driven by deeply held beliefs and attitudes rather than social norms. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Not About Sufficiency

Environmental Geography,"Environmental geography is centered on the interactions and relations of the biogeophysical environment with human societies. Environmental geographers are interested in environmental sustainability and well-being involving a wide range of human interactions that include political economy, social power, cultural identities, and others. A triad of features is introduced as distinguishing environmental geography from the related, synergistic fields within geography, in linked interdisciplinary fields, and beyond the discipline. Five principal categories of knowledge and practice are then identified as integral to environmental geography: overarching or high-level theory; intermediate or mid-range theory; specific concepts; methodologies and methods; and major, widely recognized topics and issues that are galvanizing for science, scholarship, policy, and public interest. This new model of knowledge–practice is used to examine six of the major focus areas: (i) environmental resource management and biodiversity conservation amid development and social change; (ii) climate change adaptation, natural hazards, vulnerability, and resilience; (iii) urban environmental systems; (iv) multiscale deforestation and reforestation; (v) food, agriculture, environment, and health; and (vi) energy and society transitions. Examples are detailed in the first pair of focus areas in order to discuss how environmental geographers assemble networks of knowledge–practice in order to create general understanding and useful insights. These knowledge–practice networks enable environmental geographers to work across theories and concepts, methods, and analysis in areas of urgent social need. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Can the allometric relationship between saturated water accumulation and dry mass be used to diagnose the water status of winter wheat?,"Context: Agriculture is the major consumer of fresh water globally. However, climate change-induced water scarcity is challenging the freshwater resources to meet global crop water demands. Consequently, utilizing limited water resources efficiently is increasingly important in agriculture. Accurate diagnosis of crop water status and in-season demand is imperative for precision irrigation, as it allows growers to make informed decisions about fine-tuning in-season irrigation scheduling. Plant-based diagnostic approaches such as the critical saturated water accumulation (SWA) curve have been employed to diagnose the in-season crop water status in maize. However, it remains uncertain if this indicator applies to other crops including wheat. Objective: The study aimed to develop and validate a model for quantifying the in-season water status of winter wheat using SWA curves and water diagnosis index (WDI). Methods: A four-year study was carried out by employing four water and two nitrogen rate treatments from 2019 to 2023 to establish the relationship between dry mass (DM) and SWA during the vegetative growth period of winter wheat. The effects of different water and nitrogen conditions on DM-SWA allometry were also analyzed. Besides, WDI was also derived as the ratio of the observed SWA value to the critical SWA value. Results: The allometric relationships between SWA and DM were used to construct critical SWA curves under sub-optimal and optimal nitrogen nutrition (N1: SWA = 5.34DM0.77; N2: SWA = 7.37DM0.83). The decrease in plant stem ratio and indirect soil nitrogen deficiency caused by water stress were the two main factors contributing to the decrease in plant WDI. However, uncertainties of observation and input data, model assumptions, model structure, and parameters led to a high degree of uncertainty in WDI, which affected its practical application. Conclusions: The allometric relationships between SWA and DM can potentially be used as a diagnostic tool for assessing crop water status. Nitrogen deficiency would reduce the SWA without affecting its accumulation rate. Further research is required to employ WDI for plant water status diagnosis under field conditions. Significance/Implications: The findings would assist in developing precision irrigation indicators for monitoring in-season plant water status, optimizing irrigation scheduling, selecting water-efficient cultivars, and enhancing wheat productivity. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
"Water resource security assessment and prediction in a changing natural and social environment: Case study of the Yanhe Watershed, China","Water security is the backbone of regional development. However, it is generally compromised by the increasing competition for water resources between natural and social systems, especially in areas with limited water resources. Sustainable water planning requires a comprehensive analysis of supply and demand patterns, which is difficult owing to scale mismatches in data and methodologies. This study investigated the dynamics and interrelationships of water supply and demand in a semi-arid watershed of the Loess Plateau, China, by developing a system dynamics model that simulates water security during 1980–2020 and future changes under different climate, socioeconomic development, and inter-basin water diversion scenarios during 2021–2050. The results showed that (1) by the end of 2020, the regional water security level gradually approached the water scarcity threshold indicated by the water deficit index surpassing 0; (2) under unfavorable climate and progressive socioeconomic growth conditions, up to 16 out of 30 years of simulation demonstrated water insecurity in the form of a net water quantity deficit; and (3) the water diversion project can offset such deficits in the short term, but potentially aggravates water insecurity risk by eliciting a more rapid socioeconomic growth pattern. The results indicate that curbing demand and improving water-saving technology are instructive in water resource management. For the Yanhe Watershed, the quantity and pattern of water diversion should be improved in the future to guarantee water resource security on a full temporal scale. We suggest a moderate socioeconomic growth rate to be more appropriate for this region and that efforts to solidify water use redlines and advancement in water-saving technologies are essential in the future. This study provides a scientific basis for the long-term evaluation of regional water security on a full timescale with tightly coupled hydrological components and a modeling framework for decision-makers to manage water resources sustainably. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Deceleration of China's human water use and its key drivers,"Increased human water use combined with climate change have aggravated water scarcity from the regional to global scales. However, the lack of spatially detailed datasets limits our understanding of the historical water use trend and its key drivers. Here, we present a survey-based reconstruction of China's sectoral water use in 341 prefectures during 1965 to 2013. The data indicate that water use has doubled during the entire study period, yet with a widespread slowdown of the growth rates from 10.66 km3·y−2 before 1975 to 6.23 km3·y−2 in 1975 to 1992, and further down to 3.59 km3·y−2 afterward. These decelerations were attributed to reduced water use intensities of irrigation and industry, which partly offset the increase driven by pronounced socioeconomic development (i.e., economic growth, population growth, and structural transitions) by 55% in 1975 to 1992 and 83% after 1992. Adoptions for highly efficient irrigation and industrial water recycling technologies explained most of the observed reduction of water use intensities across China. These findings challenge conventional views about an acceleration in water use in China and highlight the opposing roles of different drivers for water use projections. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Ecological process of water transformation in furrow and ridge mulching system in oat field under extreme drought scenario,"Extreme arid climate plays a critical role in affecting farmland hydrological process and crop yield in semiarid rainfed agricultural area. However, relevant field studies on this issue are not enough documented and the related solution to this issue is so far not well defined. Since 1990s, micro-field rain-harvesting farming technology has been developed and extended to a large area in semiarid Loess Plateau of northwest China, however, its functional role as a solution to cope with extreme climate change is not well recognized. In this study, we designed a two-year field experiment to address the issues of field water productivity and hydrological processes by applying ridge and furrow system under the condition of extreme weather. Oat cultivar, Bayou 3 was used as research material in this study. Field experiment was conducted at the Arid Meteorology and Ecological Experimental Station, Lanzhou Institute of Arid Meteorology of China Meteorological Administration (Dingxi County, Gansu Province) in both years of 2010 and 2011, respectively. Five farming treatments including micro-field rain-harvesting mulching technology were designed as follows: control with full irrigation, flat planting, furrow and ridge without mulching planting, furrow and ridge with film mulching planting and bare field without irrigation, respectively. Some critical parameters were systematically measured and recorded including rainfall amount, soil moisture in 0-140cm soil profile, crop growth and yield formation during whole growth period. Least significant difference (LSD) was used to detect mean differences between treatments (P<0.05). The results showed that year 2010 and 2011 belonged to two extreme climate types, i.e. phased extreme drought and whole extreme drought within the growth period. For both years, extreme drought climate led to ""dried soil layer""phenomenon in the soil profile of 60-100cm in all treatment groups. However, the treatment of ridge and furrow with plastic mulching (RFM) was observed to have a significantly positive effect on mitigating the occurrence of ""dried soil layer"". The RFM treatment resulted in a significant overall upturn in water storage amount in soil bulk at the harvesting period, with the increases in soil water storage by 41.2 mm in 2010 and 22.4 mm in 2011 in comparison with that of control group, respectively. In addition, water use efficiency and water productivity of RFM treatment were increased by 1.7 kg·hm-2· mm-1 and 0.4 kg·hm-2· mm-1 in 2010 and 6.5 kg·hm-2· mm-1 and 9.8 kg·hm-2· mm-1 in 2011 in comparison with those of control group respectively. The performance of RFM treatment was significantly superior to that of other treatments. It showed that RFM technology significantly enhanced the transformation efficiency from natural rainwater to soil water and crop water. On the other hand, above-ground biomass in RFM group was declined by 30.5% in 2010 and 67.42% in 2011 compared to that of control group, but the harvest index of RFM group was increased by 33.4% in 2010 and 55.6% in 2011 in comparison with that of control group, respectively. Furthermore, RFM treatment played a positive role in optimizing architecture traits of spike, increasing seed weight, kernels per spike and grain weight per spike. Our study indicated that the RFM system can optimize water resources distribution, mitigate temporal and spatial contradiction between water supply and water demand for oat crop production, and transform more photosynthates from vegetative growth to reproductive growth. In conclusion, the RFM system displayed great potential to relieve the occurrence of dry soil layer and improve water field productivity in rainfed oat field in 2010 and 2011. It can be argued that the RFM system could serve as an important ecological strategy in response to extreme climate events and improve food security in arid region.",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental Performance and SDGs: How Do Income Disparity, Urbanization, Resource Consumption, and Female Employers Affect the Ecological Footprint in Emerging Economies?","The significance of environmental deterioration as a pressing issue has led to its prominence in global discussions on strategies for prevention. It can be asserted that there exists a universal agreement that the enhancement of environmental quality is imperative for the promotion of sustainable development and societal well-being, especially in emerging economies. In this perspective, the present research uses panel data of the E7 economies from 1992 to 2021 to assess the effects of income disparity, urbanization, resources consumption (nonrenewable and renewable energy consumption), and women employers on ecological footprint. This study employs second-generation empirical techniques such as CIPS and CADF unit root tests, Westerlund bootstrap cointegration, and DFE/MG/PMG-ARDL models to check the relationships between the studied variables. The empirical findings of this study reveal that in the E7 countries, the ecological footprint is increased with an increased income disparity and nonrenewable energy consumption. On the other hand, urbanization, renewable energy consumption, and female employers help reduce the ecological footprint. Additionally, the results of the causality measure under the Dumitrescu and Hurlin test unveil bidirectional causality between all the independent variables except nonrenewable energy and ecological footprint. From the policy perspective, the selected countries must implement policies that promote equitable income distribution, planned urbanization to promote compact cities, efficient transportation systems, and green infrastructure, and provide opportunities for women to attain higher positions in organizations, particularly at the managerial and decision-making levels in order to address the adverse environmental consequences in emerging economies. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Development as adaptation: Framing and measuring urban resilience in Beijing,"As part of their efforts to cope with climate change, many municipal governments have considered the improvement of urban resilience as an important strategy. In this study, we take the megacity of Beijing as an example and conduct a mixed-methods research using both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore linkage between resilience and development. First, based on expert consultation, we develop an analytical framework and propose reference indicators for measuring urban resilience. Second, we conduct an exploratory factor analysis to justify this analytical framework and rank the urban resilience index for 16 districts in Beijing. Results indicate that urban resilience at the district level is distinguished by the characteristics of the district's functional zones. This implies that the development focus of each district influences the driving factors of urban resilience. This article provides evidence proving that urban generic resilience is highly dependent on socio-economic development and urbanization, whereas specific resilience can be attributed to natural endowment and environmental investment. In conclusion, using this study's findings as a guideline, mega-cities are urged to adopt development-oriented adaptation as a strategy of proactive risk planning in the context of rapid urbanization and global climate change in China. © 2019 National Climate Center (China Meteorological Administration)",Not About Sufficiency
Estimates of multidimensional poverty and its determinants among older people in rural China: evidence from a multicenter cross-sectional survey,"Background: In 2020, China declared that the absolute poverty in the country had been eradicated, but older people in rural areas are deprived in multiple domains. Poverty is multidimensional and involves deprivations in health, social welfare, living standards, and income. This study focused on assessing the poverty status of rural older persons and providing a basis for decision-making at all levels of government in China. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted in four rural areas of China. Individuals aged 60 years and older were selected through stratified sampling. People with aphasia and severe cognitive impairment were excluded. An electronic questionnaire was used to collect older people’s information, including basic demographics, major illnesses, disabilities, chronic diseases, functional disorders, and ability to perform activities of daily living. It also asked about the medical, financial, and social security assistance that respondents received, food and clothing standards, safe housing, clean energy, safe drinking water, and reliable electricity. Specific questions were asked regarding income sufficiency, financial support from children, and pension income. Multidimensional poverty measurements were used to compare regional disparities and indicators differences. Logistic regression was used to identify the risk factors influencing poverty. Results: A total of 1272 older people were analyzed. Of them, 704 (55.35%) were women and 652 (51.26%) were aged between 60 and 69 years. The most frequently mentioned causes of poverty were illness, a lack of employment, inadequate technology, and poor transportation. We found that as multidimensional poverty indicators increased (from 6 to 10), the number of poor older people decreased (from 1218 to 437), as did the poverty incidence (from 95.75 to 34.36%) and multifaceted poverty index (from 53.41 to 25.06%). Xuanwei had the highest incidence of poverty (66.61%) and multidimensional poverty index (0.66) among the four provinces studied. Regarding the contribution of indicators, financial alleviation made the greatest contribution to multidimensional poverty among rural older adults (up to 70.51%). Age, marital status, education level, awareness of poverty alleviation policies, and region were significant predictors of multidimensional poverty among older rural residents(P < 0.05). Conclusions: China’s subsidy system and financial support must be enhanced. Particular attention should be given to the re-education of rural older individuals, basic vocational education should be strengthened in rural areas, and social participation should be encouraged. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Driving Factors and Scale Effects of Residents’ Willingness to Pay for Environmental Protection under the Impact of COVID-19,"In recent years, environmental degradation and the COVID-19 pandemic have seriously affected economic development and social stability. Addressing the impact of major public health events on residents’ willingness to pay for environmental protection (WTPEP) and analyzing the drivers are necessary for improving human well-being and environmental sustainability. We designed a questionnaire to analyze the change in residents’ WTPEP before and during COVID-19 and an established ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM), spatial error model (SEM), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and multiscale GWR to explore driver factors and scale effects of WTPEP based on the theory of environment Kuznets curve (EKC). The results show that (1) WTPEP is 0–20,000 yuan before COVID-19 and 0–50,000 yuan during COVID-19. Residents’ WTPEP improved during COVID-19, which indicates that residents’ demand for an ecological environment is increasing; (2) The shapes and inflection points of the relationships between income and WTPEP are spatially heterogeneous before and during COVID-19, but the northern WTPEP is larger than southern, which indicates that there is a spatial imbalance in WTPEP; (3) Environmental degradation, health, environmental quality, and education are WTPEP’s significant macro-drivers, whereas income, age, and gender are significant micro-drivers. Those factors can help policymakers better understand which factors are more suitable for macro or micro environmental policy-making and what targeted measures could be taken to solve the contradiction between the growing ecological environment demand of residents and the spatial imbalance of WTPEP in the future. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the supply and demand linkage of cultural ecosystem services in a typical county-level city with protected areas in China,"The construction of protected areas (PAs) is not only the most effective way to preserve biodiversity resources and the natural heritage, but also provides important cultural ecosystem services (CESs) for satisfying human psychological and spiritual needs and improving human well-being. Knowledge of CESs at the county level is vital for the bottom-up promotion of the overall work of China's PAs. The assessment and mapping of the spatial pattern of CESs, and their supply and demand relationship in PAs and their surrounding areas, are of great significance for high-quality development planning at the county scale. In our study, we developed an integrated approach to mapping the supply and demand of CESs, and then integrated the SolVES model with social media comments to explore the matching relationship between CESs’ (aesthetic inspiration, education humanities, and recreation and ecotourism) supply and demand using Wuyishan City, China, with its abundant PAs, as a case study. The results showed that the supply of three types of CESs accounting for approximately 70% of the study area was greater than the demand, and thus these CESs have significant future development prospects. The distribution of the three high-supply CESs and tourist destinations showed roughly the same spatial patterns, in which the high-demand hot spots were identified in the south of Wuyishan City. And the total supply and demand levels inside the PAs were much greater than those outside. Therefore, clarifying the matching relationship between supply and demand of CESs at the county level is not only conducive to promoting the sustainable development of natural resources, but also provides a reference for the planning of county-level protection of PAs under each county's jurisdiction. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Soil health evaluation of farmland based on functional soil management—a case study of yixing city, jiangsu province, China","Given that farmland serves as a strategic resource to ensure national food security, blind emphasis on the improvement of food production capacity can lead to soil overutilization and impair other soil functions. Hence, the evaluation of soil health (SH) should comprehensively take soil productivity and ecological environmental effects into account. In this study, five functions from the perspective of functional soil management were summarized, including primary productivity, provision and cycling of nutrients, the provision of functional and intrinsic biodiversity, water purification and regulation, and carbon sequestration and regulation. For each soil function, in view of the natural and ameliorable conditions affecting SH, basic indicators were selected from the two aspects of inherent and dynamic properties, and restrictive indicators were chosen considering the external properties or environmental elements, with the minimum limiting factor method coupled with weighted linear model. The new evaluation system was tested and verified in Yixing City, China. The healthy and optimally functional soils were concentrated in the northeast and mid-west of Yixing City, whereas unhealthy soils were predominant in the south and around Taihu Lake. The main limitations to SH improvement included cation exchange capacity, nutrient elements, and soluble carbon. The SH evaluation method was verified using the crop performance validation method, and a positive correlation was noted between food production stability index and soil health index, indicating that the evaluation system is reasonable. © 2021 by the authors.

Socioeconomic drivers of provincial-level changes in the blue and green water footprints in China,"Socioeconomic development has led to increased consumption of both blue and green water. Consequently, China is facing serious water scarcity issue. However, few studies have investigated interactions of blue and green water footprints, as well as driving forces underlying the changes in water footprints across provinces and sectors. To fill in this knowledge gap, we quantified the spatial-temporal dynamics of the blue and green water footprint (BWF and GWF, respectively), and analyzed the key factors that drive the provincial-level changes in BWF and GWF from 2002 to 2012. The analysis is facilitated by the approaches of multi-region input-output analysis and structural decomposition analysis, and we developed one decoupling index to quantify the water-economy relation and substitution between green and blue water. The results show that China's BWF averaged at 161 billion m3/yr, about one-third the size of the GWF. In addition, water scarce provinces in Northern China were moving towards decoupling between economic growth and blue water consumption, with GWF playing an increasingly important role. The changes in the WFs were mainly influenced by changes in affluence (final demand per capita), technological improvements (decreased direct water consumption intensity), and consumption pattern (composition of the final demand) rather than changes in the population and export. Technology improvement, consumption pattern shift and industrial structure adjustment contribute to WF reductions, thus help improve water security and sustainability in China. This study provides a new approach to analyze water-economy relations for water scarce countries. © 2021 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Effect of water-saving society policy on water consumption in the cities of China: A propensity score matching analysis,"The increased demand for water resources due to urban population and economic growth has worsened the urban water crisis. In order to address this issue, a policy of “developing a water-saving society” (namely, water-saving society policy) has been implemented in some Chinese cities. This study takes 285 cities at the prefecture level and above as the sample and uses the propensity score matching (PSM) method to analyze the effect of China’s urban water-saving society policy on the reduction of water consumption per CNY 10,000 gross domestic product (GDP) from 2005 to 2017. The results show that the water-saving society policy significantly (p < 0.01) reduced water consumption in the study period; however, the effects differed between cities with different water resource endowments, economic development level, and urban scale. Specifically, there was a positive water consumption reduction effect in cities in humid areas, with low economic development, or of large scale, while the effect was limited in cities in arid areas, with high economic development, or of small scale. Therefore, for areas where water resource supply is insufficient, water-saving policy should be designed and implemented suiting local conditions, and it is also necessary to explore more water sources. © 2020 by the authors.

Evolution and comparative assessment of ambient air quality standards in China,"Ambient air pollution has become one of the key issues in China because it is highly associated with economic development, energy consumption, the atmospheric environment, and public health. Ambient air quality standards are guidelines of environmental management and fundamentals of air pollution emission control. To adapt to the changing environmental situation, China’s ambient air quality standard GB 3095 was established in 1982, amended in 1996, again in 2000, and most recently in 2012. This article presents a historical analysis on the evolution of China’s ambient air quality standards focusing on the critical pollutants and their concentration thresholds, as well as a comparative analysis that illustrates the differences to important developed countries and international organizations. The results show that the ambient air quality standard in China features a progressive update in pollutant items, more stringent concentration thresholds, and more scientific planning. Although there are differences in the economic, technological, and environmental development levels, China’s latest ambient air quality standard GB 3095-2012 is found to be comparable with other important standards. However, the support of macro policies and technical measures are necessary to ensure the standard is implemented more effectively. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Indigenous health gap reframed: Addressing root causes by poverty alleviation,"This paper aims to establish the links between poverty and Indigenous health gap in Australia. An outline is given of what is known about the causes of Indigenous health inequity and challenges we face in combating them. Health inequality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians will be described. Research on the causes of poor Indigenous health will be reviewed including biomedical, social and economic studies. Multiple statistical analyses are performed using morbidity, mortality and socioeconomic data to demonstrate Indigenous health is in fact a poverty issue. Age standardised hospital morbidity and life expectancy at birth are examined by means of both descriptive and analytical approach. This study clearly demonstrates that the proportion of Indigenous population is highly correlated with socioeconomic disadvantage. A clear socioeconomic gradient is found for all categories of disease and injury. Socioeconomic disadvantage accounts for one-third to one-half of the Indigenous life expectancy gap. Lifting area based poverty scores for family income and education/occupation by two quintile categories for low socioeconomic Indigenous groups appear to be sufficient to overcome the excess hospital utilisation among the Indigenous population. These findings suggest that poverty is the root cause of poor Indigenous health. Poor Indigenous health is mainly driven by environmental factors such as historical colonisation, social discrimination and resource exploitation. Problem with using race to describe ill-health is that race is not a modifiable risk factor and it indicates genetic factors may play a major role in causing poor Indigenous health. Many Indigenous people are very healthy, provided they are less likely exposed to risks of ill-health. The discussion leads to a conclusion that economic development and lifting poverty should play a central role in closing health gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous population. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Impacts of climate change on virtual water content of crops in China,"Looming water scarcity and climate change pose big challenges for China's food security. Previous studies have focus on the impacts of climate change either on agriculture or on water resources. Few studies have linked water and agriculture together in the context of climate change, and demonstrated how climate change will affect the amount of water used to produce per unit of crop, or virtual water content (VWC). We used a GIS-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (GEPIC) model to analyze the current spatial distribution of VWC of various crops in China and the impacts of climate change on VWC in different future scenarios. The results show that C4 crops (e.g. irrigated maize with a VWC of 0.73m3kg-1 in baseline) generally have a lower VWC than C3 crops (e.g. irrigated wheat with a VWC of 1.1m3kg-1 in baseline), and the VWC of C4 crops responds less sensitively to the CO2 concentration change in future climate scenarios. Three general change trends exist for future VWC of crops: continuous decline (for soybean and rice without considering CO2 concentration changes) and continuous increase (for rice with considering CO2 concentration changes) and first-decline-then-increase (other crop-scenario combinations). The trends reflect the responses of different crops to changes in precipitation, temperature as well as CO2 concentration. From south to north along the latitude, there is a high-low-high distribution trend of the aggregated VWC of the crops. Precipitation and temperature changes combined can lead to negative effects on crop yield and higher VWC particularly in the far future e.g. the 2090s, but when CO2 concentration change is taken into consideration, it is likely that crop yield will increase and crop VWC will decrease for the whole China. Integrated effects of precipitation, temperature and CO2 concentration changes will benefit agricultural productivity and crop water productivity through all the future periods till the end of the century. Hence, climate change is likely to benefit food security and help alleviate water scarcity in China. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Arable land change dynamics and their driving forces for the major countries of the world,"Arable land is an essential resource for the production of food and thus constitutes one of the most fundamental resources for mankind. This resource is burdened by population growth and economic development. The statistic data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations showed that the world's arable land area was 1. 401 billion hectares in 1990, and dropped to 1. 381 billion hectares in 2008; with the continued population growth, the world's per capita arable land was 0. 265 ha in 1990, and dropped to 0. 205 ha in 2008. By 2050, the world's population will reach 9. 1 billion. Assuming that the world's arable land area in 2008 remains unchanged to 2050, the world's per capita arable land would fall to 0. 151 hectares. Having enough arable land to feed the world population in 2050 is a major challenge, and it is a meaningful task to explore the arable land dynamics for the major countries of the world. This paper selected 21 countries for a case study, and the arable land dynamics and their possible driving factors for these countries were discussed. These countries includes ten countries with the largest cultivated areas in the world, and the countries whose population will exceed 1 billion by 2050. The research results show that, from 1961 to 2007, increasingly more countries' arable land areas were declining, and almost all of the countries are facing the shortage challenges of arable land. In fact, 90. 5% countries have suffered a downward trend of per capita arable land, which implies that the world food crisis is constantly increasing. Considering the change of total arable land area and per capita arable land area, the 21 countries can be divided into four groups: (1) Total arable land area and per capita arable land area increase at the same time; (2) Total arable land area and per capita arable land area decrease at the same time; (3) Total arable land area increases but per capita arable land area decreases; or (4) Total arable land area decreases but per capita arable land area increases. Among the different situations, population growth and economic development have been two of the key driving forces for the arable land changes. However, due to different land use potentials and different degrees of political stability, the influence factors of arable land are different among the referenced counties. For Brazil, agricultural acreage expansion and the ethanol production increase are important reasons for deforestation and arable land increases. For Bangladesh, Japan, Russia and the United States, urbanization and industrialization are the main reasons behind the reduction of arable land. However, for the Ukraine, the reduced total arable land and increased per capita arable land are closely connected to the sharp population drop and increased urban development. For the other 15 countries, rapid population growth and urbanization lead to reduced per capita arable land; at the same time, population growth has also become an important driving force for these countries to increase the total amount of cultivated land to ensure food security. However, because different countries have different reserve land resources, the arable land growth rate among these countries is significantly different.",Not About Sufficiency
To pay more or use less: China's urban water pricing regime and water awareness,"China is the most populous country in the world. Achieving the country's sustainability of water resources is vital for its economic development and social wellbeing. China's shrinking urban water availability has caused worldwide concern for which critics blame the country's poor water management policies. Recently a water price hike has been unanimously suggested by politicians and international bodies to curb urban water consumption. By reviewing urban water pricing practices and analyzing relevant data for Tianjin City, this paper finds that the water pricing regime in China has not proved to be effective for urban water saving. On the contrary, residents and households in China have been under more financial pressure to bear the brunt of the water crisis. Further problems and challenges associated with water issues and how they impact on China's policies and strategies are also discussed. Most importantly, by establishing a national sustainability strategy model, this paper suggests that water saving publicity and education can play a key role in easing China's water crisis.

Fine-scale spatial associations of Stipa krylovii and Stellera chamaejasme population in alpine degraded grassland,"Grassland degradation is one of the important environment and resource issues in North China. Different degrees of grassland degradation in alpine grassland are mainly caused by global climate change, overexploitation and other reasons, which threats to the sustainable development of grassland animal husbandry and improvement of living standards of farmers. Spatial structure of plant species is important in plant ecology as it affected the dynamics of plant populations, communities and ecosystem processes. Small-scale spatial association is the main sources of spatial heterogeneity, which can reveal the dynamic and stability of population and community structure. Stipa krylovii and Stellera chamaejasme are dominant species in alpine degraded grassland, have great significance for understanding sustainable utilization of grassland resources with studies on the spatial association of S. krylovii and S. chamaejasme. In this study for three main aims: First, to describe the scale transformation of spatial associations within the same gradient; Second, to study the spatial associations changes along with the degradation gradient; Third, to analyze the effect of bunch size structure and population patch on the spatial associations. Study sites locates in the Ma Changtan grassland in SuNan country of the north Qilian Mountain (38°47'22.1""-38°52'11""N, 99°45'11. 7""-99°57'41. 2""E). In July 2010, we recorded fine-scale (0-100 cm) spatial association of S. krylovii and S. chamaejasme from 2m×2m grids (2 cm×2 cm quadrats) in four plots under four kinds of degradation gradients: no degradation, light degradation, moderate degradation and heavy degradation. The point pattern analysis and Monte Carlo stochastic simulation method were used to quantitatively analyze spatial association. Based on bunch structure, patch characteristics, life history traits and strategies of ecological adaptation in the community, the scale transformation of spatial associations were discussed. The results showed that: (1) along with the natural pasture degeneration process extension, the population density and population territory area of S. krylovii gradually decreased, total area of hole gradually increased, and territory density increased firstly and then reduced. Meanwhile, the bunch size structure and population patch characteristics of S. chamaejasme showed the opposite change tendency; (2) under no degradation conditions, negative correlation was shown between S. krylovii and S. chamaejasme within 14 cm scale, whereas no significant was shown at 14 cm to 100 cm scales; negative correlation was shown under light degradation conditions within 51 cm scales, no significant correlation was shown at 51 cm to100 cm scales; under moderate degradation conditions, the spatial associations were no significant correlation within 86 cm scales, but positive correlation was shown at 86 cm to 100 cm scales; under heavy degradation conditions, there was no significant correlation as a whole and the scale ranges was from 0 cm to 100 cm. To sum up, the spatial associations between S. krylovii and S. chamaejasme were changed on the different scale and degradation gradient. The changes of population's bunch size structure, as well as the combining and annex of S. chamaejasme patches and the process of S. krylovii patch separated into many small ""island""patches, are not only the antecedent conditions affecting scale transformation of spatial associations, but also the critical factors of population's status and function change.",Not About Sufficiency
Extreme climate weakens the effect of biochar in increasing yield and reducing N2O emissions,"Context: Climate change and cropland degradation threaten global food security and greenhouse gas mitigation. Applying biochar has been promoted as a solution to sustain crop yields, reduce nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions, and improve soil quality. Objective and methods: However, the long-term patterns of these effects of biochar remain uncertain and may be affected by extreme climatic events. In this 12-year field experiment with different doses of biochar retention, effect size analysis, comprehensive soil health assessment, and structural equation modeling were used to evaluate biochar's temporal effects on productivity, N2O emissions, and their relationship with soil environment and aboveground climate. Results: Biochar provided positive impacts, increasing wheat yield by 6.2 %, reducing N₂O emissions by 6.0 %, and improving the soil health index by 9.5 %. Biochar significantly increased soil temperature and moisture in most years. Notably, biochar's effects on yield and N₂O emissions fluctuated nonlinearly over time. Extreme climate indices had the largest negative effect on yield, while soil properties offered the greatest positive effect. The extreme climate index had the largest positive correlation with the N2O emission effect. Conclusion: Extreme climate events are not conducive to the benefits of biochar in increasing production and reducing N2O emissions. Growing season climate factors (temperature and precipitation) indirectly enhance the yield-increasing effect of biochar, while growing season precipitation indirectly weakens the effect of biochar in reducing N2O emissions. Implications: Our work offers a model for sustainable food production, emphasizing the role of biochar in boosting long-term productivity, soil health, and environmental sustainability. However, the resilience of biochar to extreme climate events needs to be viewed with caution. The results provide new insights into the application of biochar for maintaining yield stability and food security under climate change. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Health Co-Benefits of Environmental Changes in the Context of Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality in China,"Importance: Climate change mitigation policies aimed at limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would bring substantial health co-benefits by directly alleviating climate change or indirectly reducing air pollution. As one of the largest developing countries and GHG emitter globally, China’s carbon-peaking and carbon neutrality goals would lead to substantial co-benefits on global environment and therefore on human health. This review summarized the key findings and gaps in studies on the impact of China’s carbon mitigation strategies on human health. Highlights: There is a wide consensus that limiting the temperature rise well below 2 °C would markedly reduce the climate-related health impacts compared with high emission scenario, although heat-related mortalities, labor productivity reduction rates, and infectious disease morbidities would continue increasing over time as temperature rises. Further, hundreds of thousands of air pollutant-related mortalities (mainly due to PM2.5 and O3) could be avoided per year compared with the reference scenario without climate policy. Carbon reduction policies can also alleviate morbidities due to acute exposure to PM2.5. Further research with respect to morbidities attributed to nonoptimal temperature and air pollution, and health impacts attributed to precipitation and extreme weather events under current carbon policy in China or its equivalent in other developing countries is needed to improve our understanding of the disease burden in the coming decades. Conclusions: This review provides up-to-date evidence of potential health co-benefits under Chinese carbon policies and highlights the importance of considering these co-benefits into future climate policy development in both China and other nations endeavoring carbon reductions. © 2024 Feifei Zhang et al.",Not About Sufficiency
"Fishing in muddy water? Climate policy uncertainty and corporate greenwashing in environmental, social, and governance","This study investigates the relationship between climate policy uncertainty and corporate greenwashing behavior using data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2021. The results indicate that the increasing climate policy uncertainty significantly and robustly strengthens corporate greenwashing behavior, particularly among firms located in regions with weaker environmental regulations, within high-polluting industries and with shorter-term management perspectives. Additionally, the development and widespread adoption of digital technologies, along with enhanced external regulatory pressures, can inversely moderate the positive relationship between climate policy uncertainty and corporate greenwashing. In summary, this study contributes to our understanding of corporate behavior under climate risks and provides insights for achieving social sustainability. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Sediment record of polycyclic aromatic compounds and black carbon over the last ~400 years in Sanjiaolongwan Maar Lake, northeast China","Fuel usage is an important catalyst for socio-economic development and human well-being. Human activities have resulted in significant increases in emissions from biomass burning (BB) and fossil fuel (FF) combustion which have significantly adversely affected human, ecosystem, and planetary health in this era of the Anthropocene. Sanjiaolongwan Maar Lake (SJLW), as a typical crater lake, uniquely receives atmospheric deposition from long-distance transport, and thus, its sediments reflect environmental change and human impacts on a broad scale. In this study, the concentrations and compositions of combustion products, including polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs, i.e., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their oxygenated (OPAHs) and nitrogen heterocyclic derivatives (AZAs)) and black carbon (BC and its constituents char and soot), in SJLW over the past 400 years were investigated. The results showed that the PACs and soot concentrations and fluxes in SJLW have rapidly increased since 1950. The concentrations of the total PACs increased ~4 times after the 1950s. Such a fast increase is consistent with the rapid industrialization after the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which has further accelerated beginning with the implementation of the reform and opening up policy of the PRC in 1978. Moreover, the variations in the compositions of PACs, as well as the decrease in the char/soot ratio, demonstrate a transition in energy usage from BB to FF combustion. The decrease in the benzo[e]pyrene/benzo[a]pyrene ratio indicated an increase in local emissions (because of increasing industrialization in northeast China). The temporal profile of perylene concentrations, fluxes, and perylene/5-ring PAHs ratios strongly suggest that perylene mainly originated from non-pyrogenic sources. The records of PACs and BC in SJLW offer valuable perspectives on human impacts and provide important references for the start of the Anthropocene. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Interactions of socioecological factors on the supply–demand balance of ecosystem services in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, China","A comprehensive understanding of how socioecological factors influence multiple ecosystem services (ESs) may provide stakeholders with a management tool to coordinate economic development and environmental protection. However, previous studies have focused more on the supply side compared with the demand of ESs. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms for the changes in the supply–demand balance of ESs and their multiple drivers remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, an integrated theoretical framework was developed to assess the interactions of socioecological factors, including land use and cover, the social economy, climate, and topography, with the variations in ES supply, demand, and balance, which were mapped at the city scale in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). A variance inflation factor (VIF) was employed to detect the multicollinearity of the factors, and the sum of Akaike weights was used to simplify the driving factors and identify essential driving factors. We employed variation partitioning analysis (VPA) to reveal the effects of unique and combined drivers on ES supply, demand and balance. The results revealed that undersupply cities (11.93% of the area) were concentrated within the three national urban agglomerations and increased in area from upstream to downstream, whereas oversupply cities (88.07%) were distributed mainly in the surroundings of the urban agglomerations. According to the VPA, the essential driving factors effectively explain the variation in the ES supply, demand, and balance in the YREB. More importantly, these driving factors were simplified with no significant decrease in explanatory power. In oversupply cities, the ES changes were determined based on socioeconomic factors (urbanization rate and population density), land use/land cover (cropland, woodland, and unused land), and their interactions. In undersupply cities, population density (PD) explained the majority of the variation in ESs. However, the effects of climate and topography on ESs were more prominent at the scale of all cities in the YREB. In addition, PD displayed a significant negative correlation with ES supply and balance, but was positively related to ES demand in the undersupply cities. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the effects of the interactions among socioecological factors on the supply–demand balance of ESs. This study is informative for human well-being and sustainable socioeconomic development in the region. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Health Damage of Air Pollution, Governance Uncertainty and Economic Growth","The evaluation of environmental and health governance processes is an important part of the innovation and perfection of modern governance systems. Based on the macropanel samples, this paper analyzes the impact of the health damage caused by air pollution (APHD) on economic growth and the related mechanisms accordingly using the moderate model and the threshold model. The results can be concluded as follows: (1) After locking in the health damage perspective, the APHD has a negative impact on economic growth. When other conditions are met, economic growth will significantly drop by 1.233 percent for each unit increase in the APHD index. (2) There is a moderate effect of governance uncertainty in APHD on economic growth with different characteristics. The combination of governance uncertainty and APHD can significantly inhibit economic growth, and this moderating effect has different impacts due to heterogeneous conditions. Spatially, this inhibitory effect is significantly obvious in the eastern, central, and western regions, while the negative effect is significant in areas north of the Huai River with medium and low self-defense ability. Additionally, compared with the delegating of governance power at the municipal level, when the governance power is delegated at the county level, the interaction between the governance uncertainty constructed by income fiscal decentralization and APHD has a less negative economic effect. (3) There is a threshold effect under the conditions of a low level of decentralization of prevention and control, a high level of investment in governance, and a low level of APHD. However, under the condition of a certain APHD level, when the decentralization level of pollution control is higher than 7.916 and the input level of pollution control in GDP is lower than 1.77%, the negative moderating effect can be effectively reduced. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The Regime Complexes for Global Climate Governance,"Climate change is a major challenge for human society in the 21st century and an important issue in the context of sustainable development governance. As the density of institutions in global climate governance increases, so does the potential for overlap and interaction between the various elements of institutions. The current global climate governance issue is no longer solely a state-centric governance model but presents a complex manifestation of a complex of mechanisms. Taking a global climate governance perspective, this paper finds that the institutional complex of global climate governance is shaped by internal factors, such as self-attribution, rights, and interest linkages. External factors include the rapid development of globalization and the non-governmental state of the international community. The internal logic of the institutional complex is based on the institutional fragmentation of multiple interested parties involved in the governance process and the interaction patterns of internal actors. The institutional complex of global climate governance has the following implications for policy-making: the strength of the institutional complex refers to the framework of decision-making; the flexibility of the arguments provides stakeholders with demands related to their interests and inspires different countries to join in the governance of global climate change. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"What is the global causality among renewable energy consumption, financial development, and public health? New perspective of mineral energy substitution","Under the background of global warming and economic globalization, energy structure transformation and financial liberalization have become hot issues of global concern. Additionally, the replacement of renewable energy sources for mineral energy is placed great expectations to reduce environmental pollution and promote public health. Although the effects of renewable energy consumption (REC) and financial development (FD) on public health (PH) have been verified by researchers, the long-term causality among the three has not been explored, especially from global evidence. To verify the long-term relationship and causality among REC, FD, and PH at the global level, using annual panel data for 136 nations from 2000 to 2018, this paper employs the Cross-sectional dependence test, CADF unit root test, the second generation cointegration test, Pooled Mean Group estimation, and the Granger causality test. This paper finds some interesting results. First, the long-term co-integration relationship and the two-way causal relationship are among REC, FD, and PH. Second, REC and FD have a long-term promoting effect on PH, but have no significant effect in the short term. This conclusion holds up after a series of robustness tests. Third, there is heterogeneity in the long-term impact of REC and FD on PH. The long-term PH benefits of REC are more vital in low-polluting countries, trade-open countries, poor-institution countries, and non-emerging market countries, while FD has a long-term negative impact on PH in high-polluting and trade-tight countries. Based on the above results, we believe that it is necessary to formulate appropriate energy policies and financial policies according to local conditions. In summary, our results provide essential policy recommendations for energy transformation and public health improvement in countries around the world in the process of financial liberalization. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Do carbon sequestration and food security in urban and rural landscapes differ in patterns, relationships, and responses?","The urbanization process and implementation of various ecological restoration projects have altered the urban-rural landscape patterns and ecosystem services (ESs). Do carbon sequestration and food security, which can be found differences in patterns in both urban and rural landscapes, reflect these relationships and responses? Therefore, taking the Wuding River Basin as an example, we analyzed the variations in carbon sequestration and food security across diverse urban-rural landscapes, and the evolving trade-offs/synergies between them. The results showed that carbon sequestration and food security significantly increased in urban and rural landscapes over the past 20 years, with a greater increase observed in rural landscapes due to a substantial reduction in human pressure. The maximum increase in carbon sequestration occurred at a distance of 16.6 km from human settlements. Population decline significantly strengthened the trade-offs between carbon sequestration and food security in landscapes with high and low agricultural pressure. Conversely, in developed urban landscapes, population decline enhanced the synergistic relationship between carbon sequestration and food security. Understanding the evolving patterns of carbon sequestration and food security in different urban-rural landscapes provides important evidence for developing effective landscape planning and policy strategies, which is of great significance for promoting the sustainability of urban-rural landscapes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Cryosphere Services to Support SDGs in High Mountains,"The cryosphere is able to provide a variety of services for the benefit of human well-being and underpins regional sustainable development. The cryosphere deterioration induced by climate change is impacting the services and will subsequently impede the efforts to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs) in high mountain societies. Here, we detail the context of cryosphere services and establish a dataset for its linkage to SDGs. This allows us to uncover its roles in supporting SDGs, directly by a causal connection and indirectly through either cascading effects or intercon-nection among SDGs. We find that the SDGs in association with the basic needs of high mountain societies are mostly affected by the cryosphere services. The different types of services pitch in with distinctions to be embraced by various SDGs, whilst some play a prominent role in the contribution to a broad range of SDGs. We further investigate how the services behave in their contributions to SDGs, by taking a view via the lens of a network that deciphers the relationship between the services and SDG targets as well as the interconnections among SDG targets. With an insight into the cen-trality and modularity of services in the network, we then delineate the inherent criticality of services to SDG targets as a whole, and reveal the specificity of services that co-contribute to a cluster of SDG targets in each network community. We take out the services from the network and maintain their interlinks to the targets of each underlying SDG system represented in six key entry points, so that the services critical to the transformation pathways in the entry points for SDGs in high mountains can be identified. Finally, we discuss the trade-offs that can occur in high mountains, which is unique for the cryosphere services. It creates more complexity in the assessment of overall benefits that the cryosphere services may provide to SDGs, and urges the balance that has to be maintained in attaining those services for the transformation. © 2022 by the authors.

Incorporating “relative” ecological impacts into human development evaluation: Planetary Boundaries–adjusted HDI,"During the past 30 years, Human Development Index (HDI) has evolved into a widely accepted proxy of human development. Based on Strong Sustainability and Planetary Boundaries, this paper puts forward Planetary Boundaries–adjusted HDI (PB-HDI). The PB-HDI has made references to Planetary pressures–adjusted HDI proposed by the UNDP. Being simple, transparent and theoretically valid, the PB-HDI incorporates “relative” ecological impacts, i.e. ecological impacts beyond planetary boundaries, into human development evaluation. The PB-HDI is the product of adjusted HDI and Ecological Overshoot Index. The adjusted HDI employs Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth to measure medical and health levels and sets a threshold value of Gross National Income per capita; the Ecological Overshoot Index measures “relative” ecological impacts and is constructed by employing consumption-based CO2 emissions and Material Footprint. Being compatible with intragenerational and intergenerational equity, the PB-HDI advocates achieving higher levels of economic-social development within planetary boundaries. PB-HDI values and ranks of 142 countries in 2015 are different with those of the HDI by a large extent. For the PB-HDI, Costa Rica, Panama, Hungary, Sri Lanka and Argentina perform best and Singapore, Australia, the United States, India and China do not perform well. The paper provides a more scientific and reasonable perspective and index for human development evaluation in the full world and Anthropocene. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis of carbon emission performance and regional differences in China’s eight economic regions: Based on the super-efficiency SBM model and the Theil index,"China’s carbon emission performance has significant regional heterogeneity. Identified the sources of carbon emission performance differences and the influence of various driving factors in China’s eight economic regions accurately is the premise for realizing China’s carbon emission reduction goals. Based on the provincial panel data from 2005 to 2017, the super-efficiency SBM model and Malmquist model are constructed in this paper to measure regional carbon emission performance’s static and dynamic changes. After that, the Theil index is used to distinguish the impact of inter-regional and intra-regional differences on different regions’ carbon emissions performance. Finally, by introducing the Tobit model, the effect of various driving factors on carbon emission performance differences is analyzed quantitatively. The results show that: (1) There are significant differences in different regions’ carbon emission performance, but the overall carbon emission performance presents an upward fluctuation trend. Malmquist index decomposition results show substantial differences in technology progress index and technology efficiency index in different regions, leading to significant carbon emission performance differences. (2) Overall, inter-regional differences contribute the most to the overall carbon emission performance, up to more than 80%. Among them, the inter-regional and intra-regional differences in ERMRYR contributed significantly. (3) Through Tobit regression analysis, it is found that residents’ living standards, urbanization level, ecological development degree, and industrial structure positively affect carbon emission performance. On the contrary, energy intensity presents an apparent negative correlation on carbon emission performance. Therefore, to improve the carbon emission performance, we should put forward targeted suggestions according to the characteristics of different regional development stages, regional carbon emission differences, and influencing driving factors.

Effects of climate change on the yield potentials and resource use efficiencies of mid-season indica rice cultivars in Eastern China,"Global climate change affects crop yields and endangers food security. High yielding rice varieties adapted to climatic changes is a key breeding objective. However, little is known regarding the impact of climate change on the yield potentials and resource utilization efficiencies of modern rice cultivars in Eastern China. Using two-year field experiment, we investigated the biomass, nitrogen (N) uptake, and yield in relation to climatic resource use efficiencies of eight representative Chinese mid-season indica rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars grown in the Middle-Lower Yangtze Area over the last fifty years. The yield potential of rice from 1961–2015 was simulated using the ORYZA (v3) model. The total thermal time (growing degree days) increased at a rate of 3.3 ℃ yr−1, while sunshine hours decreased at a rate of 2.4 h yr−1 over the past five decades during growth period. Compared with the average potential yield from 1961 to 1975, an average 5.65 % of reduction occurred across different cultivars from 2001 to 2015. However, the rice potential yield increased by 52.0 kg ha−1 yr−1 in the released cultivars with increasing years of release. The use efficiencies of sunshine hours and thermal time for the cultivar Yangliangyou6 released in 2001 increased by 68.5 % and 59.5 % compared with the cultivar Shenglixian released in 1938. The increase of potential yield in the released cultivar Yangliangyou6 was attributed to increase utilization efficiency of radiation. Modern cultivars (semi-dwarf and super rice) maintained greater leaf area index (LAI) during the filling period without modification in photosynthetic rate. Besides, the decrease in grain N concentration contributed to stay-green characteristic and to the efficient use of N in modern cultivars. Thus, modern indica rice cultivars tolerate the adverse climatic changes by optimizing plant productivity and increasing resource utilization efficiencies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Source apportionment of cadmium pollution in agricultural soil based on cadmium isotope ratio analysis,"Anthropogenic activities, especially industrial production and agricultural practices have led to Cd accumulation in the agricultural soil locating near to the industrial areas of China threatening soil environmental quality and food security. In this study, the sources of Cd pollution were accurately analyzed, which may lead to efficiently control the Cd content in the soil. The samples of agricultural topsoil, four possible pollution sources such as smelter dust, automobile exhaust, cement factory dust and agricultural fertilizer were collected, and the Cd concentrations and Cd isotope ratios were analyzed using the instrument of Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Multi-collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). The results indicated that the Cd concentration of agricultural topsoil (11.72 ± 0.30 mg kg−1) was much higher than the recommended value (0.6 mg kg−1). The highest δ114/110CdNIST3108 value (−0.15 ± 0.14‰) was observed for smelter dust and the lowest δ114/110CdNIST3108 value (−0.64‰) was found in cement factory dust. Similarly, the highest Cd concentration was found in smelter dust and it was clearly distinguishable from the other samples based on δ114/110CdNIST108 values. Cd isotope analysis suggested that smelter along with agricultural fertilizer were the major sources of Cd accumulation in agricultural topsoil. In addition, based on the IsoSource software, the relative Cd contribution rates due to automobile exhaust, cement factory, agricultural fertilizer, and smelter dust were 14%, 7%, 20%, and 59%, respectively, demonstrating that smelter dust is the main pollution source of Cd in the study area. Cd isotope analysis is a promising tool to accurately identify the heavy metal pollution sources. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

"Response of ecosystem services to socioeconomic development in the Yangtze River Basin, China","The provision of ecosystem services from multifunctional landscapes has contributed to human well-being. However, a general tendency exists to consider only marketed ecosystem services and to ignore non-marketed services, which has become more common when evaluating multiple-ecosystem services at the local level. In this study, we present an integrative index of multiple-ecosystem services (IMES) that avoids this tendency. Our main objective is to evaluate how socioeconomic factors interact with the spatial differences between the supply of and demand for multiple-ecosystem services. GlobCover data and a modified ecosystem service “matrix” are used to quantify and map ecosystem service supply and demand at the municipality level in the Yangtze River Basin, China. We used multiple regression analysis to detect relationships between ecosystem services and socioeconomic factors in municipalities to identify the main drivers of change in the supply of and demand for multiple-ecosystem services at the local level, respectively. The results revealed that 111 municipalities in the Yangtze River Basin (84.7% of the area) had an oversupply of multiple-ecosystem services; these municipalities were primarily situated in the western part of the upper reach and the southeast parts of the middle reach. Undersupplied areas were mainly situated in densely populated municipalities in the northern part of the lower reach and in agricultural municipalities in the northeastern part of the middle reach. The driving factors of changes in multiple-ecosystem services are significantly different not only in terms of the supply, demand and balance between the two but also among the three reaches. These differences in the driving factors among the three reaches can produce incorrect conclusions if an entire basin is considered, particularly for large basins. This information may be of interest to policymakers. The first principal component for the supply of and demand for multiple-ecosystem services exhibits a good correlation with the IMES in the Yangtze River Basin. Additionally, the integrative index of multiple-ecosystem services (including IMESs and IMESd) in the study area is relatively reliable according to the sensitivity analysis. Therefore, IMES is an effective tool for aggregating the value of multiple-ecosystem services at local scales. This tool can be used to identify the drivers of changes in multiple-ecosystem services based on the relationships between IMES and socioeconomic factors at the municipality scale. IMES should be useful for policymakers and stakeholders because it can provide important information for local decision-making. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping ecosystem services for China's ecoregions with a biophysical surrogate approach,"Spatially explicit mapping of ecosystem services (ESs) is an essential step in drawing up policies and practices designed to improve human well-being by ensuring the sustainable provision of ESs. This study used a set of quantitative surrogate biophysical indicators to map the capability of China's eleven ecoregions to provide four types of ESs (carbon capture, soil protection, water purification and provision, and habitat provision) from 2000 to 2010. The results revealed the spatial distribution patterns and time trends of the ESs of the eleven ecoregions in China. This study shows that: (1) the average annual total value of ESs provided from 2000 to 2010 increased from northwest to southeast, and in the Middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River as well as over the entirety of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and South China ecoregions; (2) the temporal trends of annual total ESs from 2000 to 2010 showed increases in most ecoregions except those of northeast China and northern China, which experienced decreases; and (3) the surrogate biophysical method for mapping the spatial and temporal characteristics of ESs gives acceptable results, especially at large spatial scales, compared to research results obtained using more complex modeling approaches. Thus the simple surrogate approach is suitable for the rapid assessment and long-term dynamic surveillance of ESs at broad spatial scales, and for tasks such as priority setting or performance assessments for nature conservation and ecological restoration with ESs as key targets. The methodology is also suitable for land-use impact analysis and trade-off analysis concerning land-use decisions in terrestrial environments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Potential of perennial crop on environmental sustainability of agriculture,"Since the advent of agriculture, more than one-fourth of Earth's land surface has been converted for agricultural purposes, which conversion from natural to agricultural landscapes dramatically changes the plant communities that are integral to ecosystem processes. By developing perennial crops through breeding would help deal with the multiple issues involving environmental conservation and food security in a world of shrinking resources. It can provide multiple ecosystem services essential for sustainable production more effectively than production systems based on annual crops, such as protecting against soil erosion, conserving water and nutrients, storing more carbon below ground, and building better pest tolerance.

Responsible for inequality: how does climate policy uncertainty increase income inequality?,"Firms, in response to risk response, tend to avoid and transfer the risks associated with climate policy uncertainty (CPU) as much as possible, which in turn has a profound impact on household income. We use Chinese prefecture-level cities as the research sample to examine the economic impact of CPU on income inequality. We find that (1) CPU exacerbates income inequality by promoting agglomeration effect, technological bias effect, and automation effect. (2) The negative impact of CPU on income inequality is not obvious in the central region, high administrative level, high capital allocation ability, low labour allocation ability and resource-based cities. (3) Shock duration, effects (as opposed to climate physical risks), and other impacts are examined. Command-and-control environmental regulations can mitigate the potential impacts of CPU, whereas market-based environmental regulations have limited effectiveness. This study examines the potential impacts of CPU on balanced development and high-quality development, providing new insights for the formulation of climate policies and the management of policy risks associated with climate change. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Smallholder farmers' behavioural intentions towards sustainable agricultural practices,"The introduction of sustainable practices is considered a win-win strategy for low-income countries because of its potential to simultaneously improve food security and address environmental issues. Despite the numerous studies that focus on the adoption of technological innovations, little work has been done on the socio-psychological behaviour of farmers with regard to sustainable practices. This study investigates smallholder farmers' intentions towards two practices: minimum tillage and row planting. The decomposed theory of planned behaviour is used as a theoretical framework to analyse the intentions. The findings reveal that attitudes and normative issues positively explain farmers' intentions to adopt both practices. Perceived control also has a positive significant effect on the intention to apply minimum tillage. When the intention is formed, farmers are expected to carry out their intention when opportunities arise. Moreover, perceived usefulness, social capital, and perceived ease of operation are also significant predictors of farmers' attitudes. Furthermore, social capital and training are factors that positively affect the normative issue, which in turn also positively mediates the relationship between training, social capital and intention. Finally, it is shown that neither the perceived resources nor information from the media significantly affect farmers' intentions. This paper thus confirms that social capital, personal efficacy, training and perceived usefulness play significant roles in the decision to adopt sustainable practices. In addition, willingness to adopt seems to be limited by negative attitudes and by weak normative issues. Therefore, to improve adoption of sustainable practices by smallholder farmers, attention should be given to socio-psychological issues. This could lead to improvements in farm productivity and enhance the livelihoods of smallholders. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Managing conflict-generating invasive species in South?Africa: Challenges and trade-offs,"Background: This paper reviewed the benefits and negative impacts of alien species that are currently listed in the Alien and Invasive Species Regulations of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Act no 10 of 2004) and certain alien species that are not yet listed in the regulations for which conflicts of interest complicate management. Objectives: Specifically, it identified conflict-generating species, evaluated the causes and driving forces of these conflicts and assessed how the conflicts have affected management. Method: A simple scoring system was used to classify the alien species according to their relative degree of benefits and negative impacts. Conflict-generating species were then identified and further evaluated using an integrated cognitive hierarchy theory and risk perception framework to identify the value systems (intrinsic and economic) and risk perceptions associated with each conflict. Results: A total of 552 alien species were assessed. Most of the species were classified as inconsequential (55%) or destructive (29%). Beneficial (10%) and conflict-generating (6%) species made a minor contribution. The majority (46%) of the conflict cases were associated with more than one value system or both values and risk perception. The other conflicts cases were based on intrinsic (40%) and utilitarian (14%) value systems. Conclusions: Conflicts based on value and risk perceptions are inherently difficult to resolve because authorities need to balance the needs of different stakeholders while meeting the mandate of conserving the environment, ecosystem services and human well-being. This paper uses the identified conflict-generating species to highlight the challenges and trade-offs of managing invasive species in South Africa. © 2017. The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Increasing meteorological drought under climate change reduces terrestrial ecosystem productivity and carbon storage,"The terrestrial biosphere absorbs about 30% of the CO2 emitted by human activities each year. The persistence of such a carbon sink, however, depends on vegetation responses to future changes in water availability. While evidence suggests an increasing frequency and intensity of meteorological droughts, the potential systematic impact on vegetation productivity and its associated carbon absorption is unquantified. Using data from CMIP6 models and multiple meteorological drought indices and comparing the historical baseline (1851–2000) to the end of the century (2076–2100), we show that the global mean drought-associated reductions in vegetation productivity are projected to increase by 2.3 times under a sustainable development scenario (shared socioeconomic pathway [SSP] 1–2.6) and 3.5 times under fossil-fueled development (SSP5–8.5). These drought-induced productivity losses are greater than the predicted increase in productivity from greater CO2 “fertilization,” particularly for cropland. Our results indicate that the exacerbation of meteorological droughts under future warming will risk global food security and may transform the terrestrial ecosystem from a carbon sink into a carbon source. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
"Modeling Water Allocation under Extreme Drought of South-to-North Water Diversion Project in Jiangsu Province, Eastern China","Along with China’s economic development and social progress, water scarcity has become increasingly challenging. Optimized allocation of water resources, especially through water transfer project, is one of the important approaches to mitigate water shortages. In this study, authors built a model of water resources allocation simulation and the microcosmic configuration based on a complex water network in the east route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project in Jiangsu Province, east China. Selecting data from the typical years with assurance rates of P = 95%, 75%, and 50%, the simulation of supply and demand of water resources under the present situation and the tapping scenario of planning project was carried out. The results showed that water supply capacity increased while water deficits decreased remarkably for the diversion projects. Under the assurance rates of P = 95%, 75%, and 50%, the rate of water shortage decreased by 10.3%, 8.0%, and 5.2%, respectively. Under the planning work situation, the amount of water increased by 2,800 million m3 even during the period of extreme drought. Based on the results, it also provided an effective plan for the hydraulic engineering to optimize the allocation and management of water resources. It is helpful for policy makers to mitigate water shortage in Jiangsu Province and other areas with water transfer projects in China and other countries. © Copyright © 2020 Zeng, Ma, Cao, Xu and Wang.",Not About Sufficiency
"Viewpoint: Back to the future for fisheries, where will we choose to go?","We present a view on global marine fisheries that emphasizes mitigating the conflict between sustainability and the scale of industrial exploitation driven by the demand of continuous economic growth. We then summarize the current state of global fisheries. Finally, we advocate strongly for scaling back industrial fisheries, most of which are non-sustainable. This can be achieved through eliminating the harmful, capacity-enhancing subsidies that prop up industrial fisheries to continue operating despite declining fish stocks. Instead, we propose to support well-managed, locally owned and operated small-scale fisheries, which generally contribute more to local employment and food security. We stress that contrary to deep-seated opinion in the fishing industry and among politicians, reducing overfishing by eliminating overcapacity in fishing fleets will actually lead to greater, not reduced catches. This would address part of the increased global seafood demand over the coming decades, which is driven by population and wealth growth.

"Still catching attention: Sea Around Us reconstructed global catch data, their spatial expression and public accessibility","In 2005, the Sea Around Us described a website (. www.seaaroundus.org) which presented, for all maritime countries and large marine ecosystems in the world, one of the most basic information items required by policy makers and fisheries managers: what catch was taken within their jurisdictional boundaries, and which countries took it. Surprisingly, for many countries this kind of jurisdictionally and/or ecologically assigned data had not been readily available before then. Since the release of these spatialized data, this material has had major influence on how fisheries are perceived by policy makers in various countries and by the global scientific community, as well as by a growing list of other stakeholders such as non-governmental environmental organizations and the general public. Here, the Sea Around Us updates the fisheries science, policy, conservation and management audience on the extensively modified spatial allocation method and a substantially improved new website. Also, this contribution points to and describes the much improved catch data underlying this website. These data now account for catches for all countries in the world by fisheries sectors (industrial, artisanal, subsistence, recreational), after augmenting the officially reported landings data through the inclusion of comprehensively reconstructed data of previously unreported catches and major discards, for every maritime country or territory in the world, and their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Also presented are the extensively improved spatial allocation procedures which assign global catch data to the 180,000 half degree spatial cells used by the Sea Around Us to subdivide the global ocean. The reconstructed data for 1950-2010 for all countries in the world and the High Seas, freely accessible and downloadable through the Sea Around Us web portal, will be updated regularly. It is hoped that these revised data and the substantially improved web utility will invigorate and assist the debate about the role of fisheries in a global framework as well as in national food security settings. © 2016 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Tabs, thermal activated building system, to improve comfort in schools","Indoor air quality has caught attention of the Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment and a large campaign was started in 2005 to make the public aware of the dangers to health as result of poor ventilation in housing. Indoor Air Quality and thermal climate in schools is problematic in many countries. The status quo in the Netherlands is presented. The goal of a first study was to evaluate the performance of exhaust-only ventilation systems and in 5 schools were measurements undertaken. In a following study, 6 schools with different ventilation systems were studied. Main conclusions from these studies were: IAQ in the evaluated schools did not meet the requirements; more ventilation was essential for better IAQ and also the thermal comfort was not adequate. As many studies focus on the ventilation aspects we focus more on the thermal comfort of the schools. A new approach to design adequate solutions for school buildings was developed during the last years. Hydronic Radiant Heating Systems or also called Thermally Activated Building Systems, with thermo activated concrete is used. In three of these new schools the systems were examined and measurements were undertaken to determine the comfort generated by these new indoor climate concepts. The results are described in the paper.",Not About Sufficiency
Fuzzy inference model for decision support in sustainable production planning processes—a case study,"Due to crises (e.g., climate crisis, extinction of species, shortage of natural resources, human health crisis), customer requirements for conventionally produced products shift to more sustainably produced products, reducing and avoiding negative environmental and social impacts. Circular thinking in production systems offers new opportunities to meet these new customer expectations. However, it enlarges new challenges for production planning too. Research gaps exist in production planning approaches, considering all three sustainability aspects (economic, environ-mental, and social) simultaneously. This paper presents a concept of a fuzzy inference model (FIM) to assess the sustainability of production programs. The FIM concept is demonstrated and tested using a single case study considering lab production schedules. The model’s outcome indicates the most significant opportunities to improve production programs’ sustainability using experts’ knowledge. © 2021 by the authors.

Agrarian potential of Ukraine under post-Maidan crisis and armed conflict: factors and patterns of regional unevenness,"Problem Statement. Regional socio-economic development is characterized by diversity and multifacetedness and is stipulated with different impacts of factors. Ukraine has a pronounced spatial asymmetry of socio-economic development of regions; therefore, it is an important case for study of various components of regional unevenness. In the present context of post-Maidan crisis and armed conflict, study of uneven development of agrarian potential in Ukraine is becoming increasingly important, whereas it is important to assess and monitor the agrarian potential of regions for economic and food security of the country and regions. Research Methodology. The research focuses on assessment of the agrarian potential development of Ukraine’s regions in 2015 and 2018, rather than on an empirical comparison of the agrarian potential development of regions before and during the post-Maidan crisis and armed conflict. A hierarchical model for assessing the development of the agrarian potential of Ukraine's regions has been elaborated. Based on the factor analysis results, the individual influence of each factor on the development of the agrarian potential of regions was determined. Using the method of ranking and Kohonen Self-Organizing Mapping, the changes in the uneven development of the agrarian potential of Ukraine’s regions during the post-Maidan crisis and armed conflict period were investigated, and the trajectories of the development of this potential were revealed. This paper aims to identify the regional patterns of agrarian potential development and determine the factors that influenced its regional unevenness during the post-Maidan crisis and armed conflict. Results. The research results prove a spatial asymmetry and an increase in regional divergence in the agrarian potential development. The impact of socio-economic and production factors was revealed to grow and the impact of natural resources and macroeconomic factors on the agrarian potential development of the regions was revealed to weaken. The trajectories of agrarian potential development of the regions are determined; they are typified in nine types of trajectories of the agrarian potential development of the regions of Ukraine during the post-Maidan crisis and armed conflict. Recommendations are given on the regional policy in the agrarian sector of Ukraine in order to mitigate the uneven development of agrarian potential in the regions. Given that Ukraine is facing the problem of inconsistency of the institutional environment with the needs of agropotential development, it is very important to implement the institutional transformations, which should focus on harmonization of state and regional policy for the agrarian sector with EU principles. © Zapototskyi Sergii, Provotar Nataliia, Trusii Oksana, Zapototska Victoriia, 2022.",Not About Sufficiency

Zambia.,"Attention in this discussion of Zambia is directed to the following: geography; the people; history; government; the economy; foreign relations; defense; and relations between Zambia and the US. In 1986, the population totaled 7 million with an annual growth rate of 3.7%. The infant mortality rate is 87/1000 with a life expectancy of 51 years. Zambia, located in south-central Africa, is bordered by Zaire, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Angola, and Namibia. The population is made up of over 70 Bantu-speaking tribes. Expatriates, mostly British (15,000 in 1986) or South African, live primarily in Lusaka where they are employed in mines and related activities. Some ancestors of present-day Zambians most likely arrived about 2000 years ago and eventually displaced or absorbed indigenous stone age hunters and gatherers. The major waves of Bantu-speaking immigrants began in the 15th century; the greatest influx occurred in the late 17th to the early 19th centuries. After the mid-19th century, the area was penetrated by Western explorers. In 1888, Northern and Southern Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) were proclaimed a British sphere of influence. Southern Rhodesia was annexed formally and granted self-government in 1923. Independence was realized on October 24, 1964. Zambia was the 1st British territory to become a republic immediately upon realizing independence. The constitution promulgated on August 25, 1973, abrogated the original 1964 constitution, and this new constitution and the national elections that followed in December 1973 were the final steps in achieving what is termed a ""1-party participatory democracy."" President Kenneth Kaunda is the major figure in the country's politics. He has wide popular support and traditionally has bridged the rivalries among the country's various regions and ethnic groups. The economy of Zambia is based primarily on its majority state-owned copper industry, which is the only significant source of foreign exchange. Copper production has dropped to less than 500,000 metric tons/year from a high of 720,000 in 1976. Beginning in late 1982, Zambian government leaders took several important steps to deal with the country's economic plight, including restricting public spending, reducing government subsidies, raising farm producer incentives, and devaluing the currency.

Sustainable Technologies in Agriculture Sector: Ensuring Green Food Production for Resource Conservation,"Sustainable farming is the vision for producing more food grains without rising global GHG emissions that is one of the policy agenda of the United Nation to mitigate high mass carbon emissions and limit the global temperature less than 2°C. This study inspired by the given theme and explored the number of factors that influenced sustainable agriculture value added in a panel of 26 European countries for a period of 2000-2017. The results show that agricultural machinery, research and development (R&D) expenditures, cereal production, fixed broadband subscriptions, telephone subscriptions, mobile cellular subscriptions, internet penetration, and high-technology exports, all have a positive impact on food production in terms of food exports and imports, and food, beverages, and tobacco consumption. The negative impact of agriculture methane (CH4) emissions, agriculture nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, inadequate insurance and financial services, and high-technology exports on food production and fossil fuel emissions across countries. The information and communication technologies (ICTs) goods exports and computer communications exports both substantially decreases carbon-fossil emissions, which support the United Nation sustainable agenda through sustainable technologies in food-environmental modeling. The sustainable technologies in food industry are desirable for mitigating global climate change impact on natural environment for food security. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Willingness to pay for green infrastructure in residential development-a consumer perspective,"This paper investigates the literature and theoretical underpinning of the concept of ""willingness to pay"" (WTP) for green infrastructure (GI) with consequences for residential development. The benefits of GI in urban settlements include improved air quality, attenuation of the urban heat island, thermal insulation and lower energy bills for green roofs and walls, the creation of social amenity space, a habitat for biodiversity, and stormwater water attenuation. Collectively, these benefits are termed eco-system services and enhance sustainability. The role of GI, the ""lungs of the planet"", is heavily correlated to atmospheric conditions; high levels of GI improve air quality, which is acknowledged widely with many cities increasing GI to make them more resilient to future predicted challenges with respect to heat and poor air quality. In addition, there is evidence that the biophilia effect enhances human well-being. There are some studies claiming that purchasers pay a premium for property with good GI. However, there is little research about the process in consumers' minds leading to such a premium-if, how, when (under what circumstances), and then to what extent are consumers willing to pay for GI. This process, if better understood, may enable sellers or policy makers to influence the amounts of GI in developments, thus making it possible to enhance the value of GI to buyers. There is some research pointing to factors to be considered when modeling such processes. For developers, knowing the optimum amount of GI would enable them to design and construct developments with maximum purchaser appeal. To do this, stakeholders need to predict the level of WTP amongst potential purchasers for which they need to understand the decision processes behind WTP. In this way, sustainability in residential property development could be optimized. The paper analyzes the literature and theories concerning WTP, focusing on dwellings and GI. Our findings are that some quantitative evidence exists that purchasers pay more for residential property with high levels of GI in some cities, but they do so without any understanding of the possible decision processes leading to those premiums (if, how, when, and then to what extent). The paper proposes a comprehensive conceptual model that may explain buyers' WTP for a dwelling based on a presumed cost-benefit analysis performed by buyers, which has been extended here to include GI and psychological factors. Thus, the paper has a consumer perspective. The model may be used to select variables and test them in empirical studies, and by integrating with other factors in the model, it can attain a more comprehensive understanding of WTP for GI in residential development. © 2020 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency
Zaire.,"Focus in this discussion of Zaire is on the following: geography; the people; history, government and political conditions, foreign relations, and relations between Zaire and the US. The Republic of Zaire, formerly the Democratic Republic of the Congo, lies on the Equator, with 1/3 of the country to the north and 2/3 to the south. In 1982 Zaire's population was estimated to be 32 million with an annual growth rate of 3.1%. The infant mortality rate is 130/1000 with a life expectancy of 51 years. As many as 250 ethnic groups have been distinguished and named. It is believed that Zaire was populated as early as 10,000 years ago. In 1482, the Portuguese navigator Diego Cao arrived at the mouth of the Congo River. Early seafarers stayed near the mouth of the river and named the area Congo. The area remained virtually unknown to most Europeans until Henry Morton Stanley journeyed from East Africa across the continent to the mouth of the Congo River between 1874-77. In a 1958 speech at Brazzaville, General Charles de Gaulle gave French African colonies a choice between complete and partial independence. After that, the Belgians could no longer suppress Congolese independence movements. Independence was achieved June 30, 1960. A key political issue in Zaire following independence was whether the country was to have a federal system of government or unitary system with a strong central government. From 1960-66, a modified federal system gave a degree of political power to the provincial governments. The country has a highly centralized 1-party government. The Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR), founded by President Mobutu in 1967, has been designated successively the country's ""first,"" ""supreme,"" and then, by virtue of the August 1974 constitution, its ""only"" political institution. Politically, 1978-87 has been a relatively calm period for Zaire, and security has been better than at almost any time since independence. At independence, Zaire had one of the most highly developed and diversified economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Agriculture is the base of the economy, but mining generates much revenue. Zaire's extractive industries have provided the main impetus for economic development. During the 1970s, Zaire was hit hard by the worldwide decline in prices for copper and its other main exports. Despite recent high copper prices, formidable obstacles to economic recovery remain. Zaire pursues a policy of moderate nonalignment between East and West and plays an important role in international and regional forums. US bilateral economic and military assistance to Zaire from independence through fiscal year 1987 was $1,145.6 million.",Not About Sufficiency
Romanian rural tourism in the context of sustainable development,"Tourism, in all its activities, is dependent on the environment, and by exploiting its resources, products are created, creating a significant added value. But all this must take into account the rational use of natural resources with risk of depletion or degradation and the ability to achieve a decent standard of living for future generations, with an equitable distribution of general or specific revenue. Based on these considerations, the aim of this chapter is to assess the evolution of touristic infrastructure both in time and in terms of regional distribution. To estimate the tourism supply of Romanian rural tourism accommodation, the main statistical indicators used were the number of agro tourist boarding houses, the existing accommodation capacity, and the accommodation capacity in operation, their territorial concentration, and the way in which the results are strategic levers in the regional development of Romania. © 2015 by IGI Global.

Doing burden-sharing right to deliver natural climate solutions for carbon dioxide removal,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) figures prominently in modelled pathways to achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5-2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. However, national roles and responsibilities to deliver CDR have been informed with CDR quota analyses that focus on developed economies and global major emitters. This study extends the discussion to implications for developing countries. For that purpose, we employ a diverse set of allocation methods on a wide range of global emissions scenarios to address equitability and uncertainty in sharing the burden of climate change mitigation. We further focus on tropical developing countries due to their large potential for natural climate solutions (NCS) that deliver CDR. Our analysis indicates the potential for stringent CDR quotas for the top seven countries that contribute ∼60% of pantropical cost-effective NCS potential, with median national quotas across emissions scenarios ranging from 0.1-29 GtCO2. However, the results reveal strong heterogeneity of quotas and inherent bias across allocation methods making agreement on an ‘equitable’ quota unlikely. Competition among NCS and non-NCS CDR options may arise when ambitious CDR quotas are implemented in countries with vast forest areas or large potential for expansion of tree cover. Therefore, it is important to not use CDR quotas to evaluate national climate actions or to inform climate targets that could exacerbate trade-offs between emissions reduction, biodiversity and ecosystem services in these NCS-rich countries. Instead, results from burden-sharing exercises could foster higher ambition if used to inform voluntary cooperation mechanisms. Discrepancy between perceived fairness and CDR quotas should be critically and transparently embraced to encourage acknowledgment of socio-ecological co-benefits as compensation. Such an approach will allow tropical developing economies to prioritise protection and restoration of nature in their climate change mitigation pathways. © 2022 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Understanding synergies and trade-offs between water and energy production at landfill sites,"Landfills provide the most commonly used waste disposal solution. They are designed to reduce the risk of environmental or public health hazards due to waste disposal, and are used for waste management purposes in many places around the world. Depending on the design of the site and recovery methods, landfill sites can work as a potential reserve of energy and water for society. Landfill biogas is a source of renewable energy, and surface water can be collected in a retention pond. Although researchers broadly agree on the importance of incorporating the concept of the energy and water nexus into policy strategies and decision-making, the lack of studies focused on how governance methods that incorporate energy-water linkages at landfill sites can improve the provision of these two essential services has hindered progress in this direction. This study analyzes the links between water-energy nexus at a restored landfill site in Taipei City, Taiwan. The study tracks leachate and methane production at the site over the time periods when the landfill was actively receiving waste and after its closure and since its restoration. The results of model simulation of leachate yield and methane collection under different conditions show that energy and water production changed considerably during the time span under consideration. We identified an increasing trend of water and energy production in the landfill operation phase and a decreasing trend of water and energy production in the landfill restoration phase. In addition, we also identify a synergy between energy generation and water volume during the operation phase, and show that no trade-offs between energy generation and water volume were observed during any of the phases studied. These observations imply that greater water volumes will always lead to greater energy production, which can help inform future landfill design and governance practices. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Soil moisture dominates gross primary productivity variation during severe droughts in Central Asia,"The onset of severe drought is usually accompanied by anomalies in soil moisture (SM) and climatic factors such as temperature (Tem), solar radiation (Srad), and vapor pressure defict (VPD). These factors are critical for gross primary productivity (GPP) as they directly influence photosynthesis. Central Asia (CA), characterized by a dry climate and water scarcity, frequently experiences severe droughts, leading to a decrease in GPP. However, how anomalies in SM and climatic factors affect GPP in CA, and the dominant factors causing the decline in GPP during severe droughts, remain unclear. Here we first identified severe droughts in CA from 2000 to 2021 using the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) and then investigated the effects of anomalies in SM, Tem, Srad, and VPD on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and GPP under severe drought conditions by light-use efficiency P-model and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The results show that the severe droughts in CA from 2000 to 2021 occurred in 2008 and 2021, with scPDSI values of −3.26 and − 3.94, respectively. In 2008 and 2021, SIF and GPP showed significant decreases: the area of negative anomalies in SIF and GPP was more than 70 % of CA. The spatial pattern of SM anomalies is consistent with that of SIF and GPP. P-model simulations indicate that SM deficits dominated the decline in GPP in 2008 and 2021, affecting regions covering 31 % and 17 % of CA, respectively, with GPP reductions exceeding 5 %. RF predictions also indicated that during severe drought, SM had a significant effect on GPP, while Srad, Tem, and VPD had a slight effect on GPP. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change and staple grain acreage: Regional adaptation in China's agricultural cluster,"Regional adaptability in staple grain production is fundamental to agricultural clustering, yet the impact of climate change on spatial distribution of grain cultivation remains understudied. This study uses recent county-level data from 2000 to 2019 in China and employs an empirical framework that incorporates 10-year averages of weather variables to analyze regional variations in grain acreage in response to changes in temperature and precipitation. Our findings reveal significant regional heterogeneity: increases in temperature and precipitation generally lead to an expansion of staple grain acreage in initially colder or drier regions. These findings remain robust after accounting for a range of confounding factors. Mechanism analysis indicates that these climate-induced changes in grain acreage stem from variations in land productivity. Furthermore, the study identifies shifts in comparative advantages among staple grains across regions: rising temperatures favor paddy over corn in colder regions and corn over wheat in warmer areas, while increased precipitation enhances corn's advantage over wheat in arid regions. These findings have important implications for designing effective adaptation policies to sustain grain production in China's agricultural clusters and ensure food security targets. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Improving China's maritime law enforcement operations against overfishing in the South China Sea—Based on a comparison with the Indonesian law enforcement system against IUU Fishing,"Overfishing in the South China Sea has become increasingly severe these years, with Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing being one of the main contributors to this problem. To ensure regional and global food security as well as stability, it is necessary and urgent for the South China Sea coastal states to deal with overfishing effectively. Based on a comparison with the Indonesian law enforcement system against IUU fishing, the paper proposes a path for China to improve its fishery law enforcement system. It also utilizes VIIRS-DNB data analysis to support some viewpoints and highlight areas needing special attention. In the future, China should clarify the legislation, policy, and institutional authority distribution for fishery law enforcement; adopt more effective measures while meeting the necessity requirements of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; strengthen international cooperation, attempting to reach temporary fishing zone agreements with other coastal states in disputed waters; and involve local fishing communities in the development of the enforcement system. © 2025 Yu, Liu.

Closing the gap between climate regulation and food security with nano iron oxides,"Rice production poses one of the most important dilemmas between climate regulation and food security. While fertilization often results in a higher yield, it is also accompanied by more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For this dilemma, the final consideration usually depends on the trade-offs to mitigate on-going climate change while supporting a continuously growing global population. Here we conducted a 4-year field experiment to evaluate the capacity of iron oxide nanoparticles (FeONPs) at 6.3 kg ha−1 yr−1 as the basal fertilizer to close the gap of such trade-offs. Compared with urea fertilization, FeONPs can mitigate climate change by reducing 50% of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions while supporting significant soil carbon sequestration by 7.4% in the fourth year. Moreover, through reductions in ammonia volatilization and the entrapment of nitrogen in nanoparticles, FeONPs improve the retention of soil nitrogen nutrients, leading to an increase in food production of up to 25%. Our results show that FeONPs effects became more and more prominent throughout a continuous 4-year application. Together, our study revealed FeONPs as a next-generation fertilizer with great potential to solve the dilemma of meeting food security demand while complying with climate regulation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of nature-based solutions in disaster risk reduction: The decision maker's perspectives on urban resilience in São Paulo state,"This paper presents the co-learning process outcomes based on Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) and Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). EbA principles are directly associated with resilience improvement that depends on NbS for change of patterns and actions. Basically, we expected to explore how urban systems can be improved avoiding environmental degradation (i.e. waste ecosystem services and their benefits). Therefore, distinct scenarios were proposed with specific objectives: (1) identification of barriers and challenges; (2) identification of opportunities for NbS implementation. Throughout a workshop, we had chance to discuss knowledge gaps and potential emerging research such as: (1) synergies between DRR and EbA; (2) a long-term perspective of ecosystem management; (3) dynamic of DRR and the natural processes involved considering the complexity of NbS. We conclude that existing measures are limited in their ecological focus regarding to DRR and benefits they address. For this reason, a more comprehensive approach to support NbS and its systematic mainstreaming is required. © 2019",Not About Sufficiency
Designing water abstraction regimes for an ever-changing and ever-varying future,"Most of the world's water entitlement and allocation regimes evolved during periods of abundance and, hence, are not well suited to the management of water scarcity. Development of the institutional arrangements necessary to manage changing demands and supplies is in its infancy.Design criteria for the development of a set of institutional arrangements for the robust management of scarce water resources is offered and then used to develop a generic framework for the allocation and use of water. Variations to account for differences in ground, regulated and unregulated water resources are offered. The question of how best to sequence reform of existing water entitlement and allocation regimes is also addressed.The result is a recommendation for the use of water sharing plans to determine how much water may be used at any point in time and an unbundled suite of arrangements that enable efficient but separated management of long term and short term considerations and, also, the control of externalities.System-wide adjustment is facilitated through the periodic revision of water sharing plans. Individual adjustment to changing circumstances is facilitated through trade in entitlements and allocations.Before the introduction of institutional arrangements that encourage adjustment through trade it is recommended that the abstraction regime used be converted into one that accounts for return flows and allocates water according to shareholder entitlement. Seniority, beneficial-use criteria and opportunities to third parties to prevent adjustment according to pre-specified rules should be repealed. Well-designed regimes can be extended to include dam-capacity shares and allow the use of market-based instruments in delivery of water-quality objectives.

"Drought, Flood, and Rice Security in Central Thailand","With roughly 63 percent of the country’s agricultural area allo-cated for rice farming, rice has long been a key food staple and export crop for Thailand. As with other crops, rice is heavily dependent on water, whether it is from precipitation or irrigation, and is also sensitive to changing temperatures. The impacts of droughts and floods on rice farming are a fundamental source of concern for Thai farmers and the government. This article focuses on the effects of droughts and floods on rice quality and quantity, as well as on farmers’ rice income and prospects for livelihood diversification. Based on our interviews with rice farmers in Uthaithani, Chainat, and Ayutthaya, droughts and floods dimin-ish rice yields and increase incidences of crop failures, both partial and complete. They also lower the quality of rice and further depress net head rice yields by altering rice grain dimensions and moisture levels, as well as increasing the amount of cracked and immature grains. These outcomes contribute to a significant decline in farmers’ earnings and investment losses in the case of crop failures. Reduced access to government subsidies together with increased input costs due to droughts and floods are also crucial factors decreasing farmers’ earnings. Off-farm and on-farm livelihood diversification becomes an inevitable survival strategy for many rice-farming households to manage weather related challenges, stabilize their income, and smooth consumption. Our findings point out the need to bolster on-farm adaption capacities of rice farmers at the household, provincial, and national levels to ensure domestic and global rice security and ameliorate dangers to Thai farmers’ livelihood and well-being. © 2024 East-West Center.",Not About Sufficiency
"Concentration of traffic air pollutants and influencing metrological factors in Hawassa City roadways, Ethiopia","Introduction: The traffic air pollution caused by transportation is a growing global problem that contributes to millions of deaths each year. Despite its importance, information on pollutant concentration is limited in many developing cities, especially in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the concentration levels and spatial and temporal variations of traffic air pollutants in Hawassa and to investigate the influence of metrological parameters on the concentration of traffic air pollutants. Methods: A real-time monitoring system of Aero-Qual Series 300/500 was used to monitor pollutants, and 24 monitoring sites were included on both heavy and low-traffic volume roads. The study monitored morning and afternoon times over 24 days to comprehensively characterize the temporal variations. Results: The results showed that the mean PM2.5 concentration on heavy- and low-traffic volume roads was 161.6 ± 26.1 μg/m3 and 95 ± 14.2 μg/m3, respectively, whereas the PM10 concentration was 178.7 ± 20.3 μg/ m3 and 102.3 ± 17.6 μg/m3, respectively. Similarly, the mean NO2 concentrations on roads with heavy and low traffic volumes were 86.4 ± 14.4 μg/m3 and 61.7 ± 14.2 μg/m3, respectively. Significantly higher, concentrations were recorded on traffic light roads, followed by main asphalt roads, for both types of traffic air pollutants. The ratio of PM2.5/PM10 was higher (0.924), in which the pollution sources attributed to anthropogenic sources. Kendall’s tau-b correlation analysis suggested that Meteorological parameters (temperature and relative humidity) were positively correlated with traffic air pollutants. Likewise, stepwise multiple linear regression analysis confirms that the concentrations of traffic air pollutants had a positive relationship with metrological parameters. Implications: The findings of this study therefore showed the need for regular air quality monitoring of the urban areas to copping out the adverse public health impacts. And, it highlighted an urgent need for long-term monitoring of traffic air pollution and the development of emission control programs that can be readily implemented to decrease the emissions from anthropogenic sources. Also, it brings a sense of collaboration among stakeholders to tackle the effects of air pollution by providing an inclusive and sustainable development agenda for Hawassa.

Impact assessment of cascade freshwater reservoir using the ecological security assessment (ESA) model across a four-year timescale,"The existence of cascade reservoirs in complex ecosystems not only assists humans to regulate and use water resources efficiently, but the presence of hydropower also contributes to reducing carbon emissions. In recent decades, the ecology of the water sources comprising cascade reservoirs has been subject to a wide range of threats. Assessing these threats is essential for sustainable operation and management strategies of cascade reservoirs. This paper aimed to propose an ecological security assessment framework using an improved Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response model to assess a typical riverine cascade reservoir located in the subtropical region of Zhejiang, China. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods to describe the indicators involved in social, economic, ecological, and management. Simultaneously, the degree of deviation from the standard state of ecological security in the study area is assessed with the help of the ecological security index. The analysis shows that the ecological security index of the study area for the four years increased from 81.67 in 2019 to 90.14, where the lowest value has been the socio-economic impact index, indicating that the study area is in a state of ecological security with a score higher than 90.00, but the impact of socio-economic activities on the study area is more pronounced in comparison with other aspects. The model shows that control management with a score of 92.70 in 2022 plays a vital connecting role. Good control management increases socio-economic growth by 16.82%, improves ecological health by 10.23%, and enhances ecosystem services by 5.25% compared to 2019. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency

This study investigates the coupling coordination and spatial heterogeneity between urbanization, the environment, and food security in China from 2004 to 2020, employing the coupling coordination degree model, the spatial correlation model, the Dagum Gini coefficient, and the obstacle degree model. The results show that: (1) the level of coordinated development between urbanization, the environment, and food security in China has significantly increased, as evidenced by a remarkable rise in the coupling coordination degree; (2) a robust positive spatial correlation is observed in the coupling coordination degree, with “Low-Low” clusters predominantly concentrated in northwest China and “High-High” clusters primarily located in southeast China; (3) inter-regional differences are identified as the primary cause of this spatial heterogeneity; (4) food security has emerged as the foremost obstacle to coordinated development between urbanization, the environment, and food security in China. Optimizing the rational allocation of natural resources across different sectors, enhancing resource use efficiency, and strengthening environmental pollution control and management have been proven to be crucial measures and key strategies for promoting their coordinated development. This study provides a novel perspective on balancing the intricate relationship between urbanization, environmental protection, and food security, which is conducive to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals in developing countries. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Do Ecological Restoration Projects Improve Water-Related Ecosystem Services? Evidence from a Study in the Hengduan Mountain Region,"Land use/land cover (LULC) and climate change are major driving forces that impact ecosystem services and affect human well-being directly and indirectly. Under the future interaction between LULC and climate change, the impact of different land management and climate change scenarios on water-related services is uncertain. Based on this, the CLUMondo model, which focuses on land use intensity, was used to simulate the land system under different land management scenarios in the future. By coupling the downscaled climate scenario data, this study used the InVEST and RUSLE models to estimate the annual water yield and soil erosion in 2050 in the Hengduan Mountain region and analyzed the variation differences in different sub-watersheds. The results indicated that, under the influence of LULC and climate change, when compared with the amount for 2020, the soil erosion in the Hengduan Mountain region in 2050 was reduced by 1.83, 3.40, and 2.91% under the TREND scenario, FOREST scenario, and CONSERVATION scenario, respectively, while the water yield decreased by 5.05, 5.37, and 5.21%, respectively. Moreover, the change in soil erosion in the study area was affected by precipitation and closely related to the precipitation intensity, and the impact of climate change on the water yield was significantly greater than that of LULC change. The spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion and water yield was obvious at the sub-watershed scale. In the future, soil erosion control should be strengthened in the northern regions, while water resource monitoring and early warning should be emphasized in the central-eastern regions. Our results provide scientific guidance for policy makers to formulate better LULC policies to achieve regional water and soil balance and sustainable management. © 2022 by the authors.

Water scarcity under various socio-economic pathways and its potential effects on food production in the Yellow River basin,"Increasing population and socio-economic development have put great pressure on water resources of the Yellow River (YR) basin. The anticipated climate and socio-economic changes may further increase water stress. Many studies have investigated the changes in renewable water resources under various climate change scenarios, but few have considered the joint pressure from both climate change and socio-economic development. In this study, we assess water scarcity under various socio-economic pathways with emphasis on the impact of water scarcity on food production. The water demands in the 21st century are estimated based on the newly developed shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and renewable water supply is estimated using the climate projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. The assessment predicts that the renewable water resources would decrease slightly then increase. The domestic and industrial water withdrawals are projected to increase in the next a few decades and then remain at the high level or decrease slightly during the 21st century. The increase in water withdrawals will put the middle and lower reaches in a condition of severe water scarcity beginning in the next a few decades. If 40ĝ€% of the renewable water resources were used to sustain ecosystems, a portion of irrigated land would have to be converted to rain-fed agriculture, which would lead to a 2-11ĝ€% reduction in food production. This study highlights the links between water, food and ecosystems in a changing environment and suggests that trade-offs should be considered when developing regional adaptation strategies.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Drivers of Ecosystem Service Bundles in the Altay Region: Implications for Sustainable Land Management,"Understanding the dynamics of ecosystem services (ESs) in arid landscapes and socio-ecological systems is crucial for sustainable development and human well-being. This study uses the Invest model to quantify the spatio-temporal changes in four key ecosystems services in Altay from 1990 to 2020: water yield (water yield), carbon stock (carbon stock), soil retention (soil retention), and habitat quality (habitat quality). The trade-offs/synergies between different ESs were investigated via Spearman’s correlation analysis. Ecosystem service bundles (ESBs) were mapped using self-organizing mapping (SOM), and the key drivers of ES relationships and the spatio-temporal dynamics of ESBs were revealed through redundancy analysis. The results showed that water yield increased by 33.7% and soil retention increased by 1.2%, while carbon stock and habitat quality decreased by 3.5% and 1.24%, respectively. The spatial distribution pattern had a clear zonal pattern, with the northern mountainous areas higher than the southern desert areas. The six pairs of ESs, in general, showed mainly low trade-off and high synergistic relationships, with trade-offs between water yield and carbon stock, soil retention and habitat quality, and a decreasing trend of trade-offs over time. Four types of ESBs were distinguished, and the compositional differences and spatial distribution within each ESB were determined by interactions between ESs and landscape types. There are complex non-linear relationships between the drivers and the four ESBs in different years. Before 2010, ecological factors were the key drivers influencing the spatio-temporal changes in ESBs, whereas social and environmental factors combined to drive changes in ESB allocations after 2010. Additionally, this study found that the implementation of conservation measures, such as reforestation and sustainable land management practices, positively influenced the provision of ecosystem services in the Altay region. These findings underscore the importance of integrating conservation efforts into land use planning and decision-making processes to ensure the sustainable delivery of ecosystem services in arid landscapes. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"An assessment of the knowledge and demand of young residents regarding the ecological services of urban green spaces in Phnom Penh, Cambodia","The fast and steady economic growth and social changes in recent years in Cambodia have brought rapid expansion and restructuring to its cities. These phenomena have brought numerous challenges including threats to urban green spaces (UGS's). This study addresses problems of UGS's by investigating the knowledge and perceptions of young residents of Phnom Penh (YRPPs) toward UGS's in relation to the following: (1) basic knowledge of YRPPs on ecological services (KES) of UGS's; (2) perceptions of YRPPs on the current state of UGS's (PUGS's) in Phnom Penh; (3) demand of YRPPs for UGS's in the city (DUGS); and (4) associations between KES, PUGS's, social profiles (SoPs), and DUGS. A questionnaire was designed to solicit knowledge from 554 respondents randomly selected from the study area. The findings revealed that 83.1% of total respondents strongly recognized ecological services of UGS's. Four subgroups of ecological services, namely microclimate (89.7%), environmental quality and functions (83.8%), recreational and public health services (88.5%), and economic benefits (70.4%) were all rated highly. Because the current state of UGS's was very poor (68.4%), demand for UGS's was high (94.43%). Public toilets (84.7%) and rubbish bins (75.6%) were both rated the poorest. The PUGS's were significantly associated with KES (r = 0.307, F (3, 543) = 18.83, p < 0.001). This study offers a deep understanding about knowledge and demand of YRPPs for UGS's.",Not About Sufficiency
Field Test Study of Organics-Contaminated Groundwater In-Situ Remediation by Ozone Micro-nano-bubbles,"Organics-contaminated groundwater poses a threat to public health, which calls for the green and sustainable in-situ remediation technologies. Traditional groundwater remediation methods, including pump and treat and in-situ chemical oxidation, face issues of high cost, low time efficiency, and potential secondary pollution. Ozone micro-nano-bubble (MNB) with strong oxidation ability and low secondary pollution, has been considered as a promising technology for in-situ remediation of organics-contaminated groundwater. However, the complexity of the actual field groundwater environment requires further investigation to examine the feasibility of ozone MNB enhanced oxidation technology in practical engineering. A field test of groundwater remediation at an organics-contaminated site using ozone MNBs was conducted in this study. During the remediation, a large amount of contaminants were removed from the groundwater, demonstrating the excellent remediation efficiency of the ozone MNBs for contaminated groundwater. During the remediation process, the contamination sources within the site and the poor well construction quality limited the effectiveness of ozone MNBs, showing the significant impact of site conditions and the supporting facilities. This study demonstrates that ozone MNBs have potential applications in the remediation of organics-contaminated groundwater, but the field situation and supporting facilities construction should be adequately evaluated for remediation project design. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Biopriming of Maize with their endophyte Aspergillus fumigatus reinforces their resistance to salinity stress and improves their physiological traits,"Zea mays L. (Maize) is one of the most crucial world’s crops, for their nutritional values, however, the water scarcity and consequent soil salinization are the major challenges that limit the growth and productivity of this plant, particularly in the semi-arid regions in Egypt. Recently, biopriming has been recognized as one of the most efficient natural-ecofriendly approaches to mitigate the abiotic salt stress on plants. The haploid (128) and triploid (368) seeds of maize were selected as model verities for assessing their resistance to salt stress and mitigating their effect by fungal-biopriming. Overall, the haploid and triploid plants viabilities were drastically affected by salt concentration, at 500 mM of NaCl. At 500 mM NaCl, the fresh weights of the triploid and haploid seedlings were reduced by ~ 5 and 6.1 folds, compared to the controls, ensuring slightly higher salt resistance of the triploid than haploid ones. The pattern of the endophytic fugal isolates was plausibly changed with the salt concentration for both plant types, Aspergillus fumigatus isolate was emerged with the higher NaCl concentration (400–500 mM), and their morphological identity was molecularly confirmed and deposited into Genbank with accession # PQ200673. The fungal bioprimed seeds of the haploid and triploid plants were irrigated with 400 mM NaCl. The fungal-bioprimed plants displayed a significant improvement on the shoot density, fibrous roots, root length, shoot length, and leaves numbers and areas of the stressed-plants by ~ 1.7 folds, compared to control, ensures the triggering of different salt resistance machineries in plants upon fungal biopriming. The total antioxidant enzymes activities “catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase” of the salt-stressed bioprimed maize plants were increased by ~ 4.7–5.3%, compared to control, confirming the mitigating effect of the salinity stress on plants upon fungal biopriming. The chlorophyll and carotenoids contents were significantly increased of the salt stressed maize upon biopriming with A. fumigatus. The expression of the sod, apx2, nhx11, hkt1, H + -PPase, nced of the plant salt stressed was strongly increased in response to A. fumigatus biopriming, normalized to β-actin gene. The expression of apx2 was dramatically increased by about 30 and 43 folds, in response to fungal biopriming. The nhx1 was significantly up-regulated by 18.9 fold in response to fungal biopriming, compared to control. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Economic growth and environmental technology simultaneously important for reducing energy poverty and ecological footprint in E7 economies: do political institutions play a role?,"Energy poverty and climate change are major concerns for the emerging seven countries. Therefore, this study explores the economic growth impact on reducing energy poverty and ecological footprint in the emerging seven economies from 2000 to 2019. Energy poverty is measured using three disciplines: availability poverty, accessibility poverty, and affordability poverty. We applied a new dynamic method, “bias-corrected method of moments estimators (2021),” for long-run outcomes. This study used the environmental Kuznets curve—approach to measure economic growth’s scale effect and technique effect to reduce energy poverty and ecological footprint. Importantly, the study explores the mediating role of politically stable institutions in mitigating environmental and energy poverty. Our findings validate that energy poverty and ecological footprint could not reduce at the initial stage of economic growth. However, the later development stage shows a positive effect on reducing energy poverty and ecological footprint. These results validated an inverted U-shaped Kuznets curve hypothesis for emerging seven. Further, the result found that strong political systems are more quick-witted and have the legislative power to swiftly implement beneficial policies to pull out of the vicious circle of energy poverty. Further, environmental technology significantly reduced energy poverty and ecological footprint. The causality analysis entails that a bidirectional exists between energy poverty, income, and ecological footprint. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Turkey's environment and public health in the neo-liberal age: An inconvenient truth,"Studies reflecting a heightened interest in the relationship between environmental degradation and public-health problems often indicate a positive relationship between the two. However, a closer look reveals that these studies have not examined the assumed relationship between environmental predicaments and public health in a systematic fashion, nor have the discussions engaged with the peculiarities of Turkey's historic phases of capitalist development. This article examines the relationship between environmental degradation and public health from apolitical economy perspective. The author argues that since the 1980s, under intense pressure to comply with neo-liberal policies, Turkey has pursued an unsustainable use of the environment that may be causing public health to deteriorate at an accelerated pace. The situation may worsen as a result of the impoverishment of the public healthcare system, which has been increasingly privatized according to the very same neo-liberal policies. © 2012 AWG Publishing, Toronto Canada.",Not About Sufficiency
"China’s Rural Revitalization Policy: A PRISMA 2020 Systematic Review of Poverty Alleviation, Food Security, and Sustainable Development Initiatives","This systematic review evaluates China’s Rural Revitalization Policy, focusing on sustainable agriculture, food security, and poverty alleviation initiatives from 2010 to 2024. The study addresses critical gaps in understanding how these combined efforts impact long-term food security and ecological sustainability in impoverished areas, moving beyond the short-term outcomes often emphasized in existing literature. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we reviewed 33 peer-reviewed publications from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, employing bibliometric analyses in RStudio to assess citation patterns, collaboration networks, and thematic evolution. Our analysis reveals significant progress across three interconnected domains. First, poverty alleviation initiatives achieved a 12.3% reduction in rural poverty through integrated agricultural modernization and targeted support programs. Second, agricultural productivity increased by 9.8% through technological integration and sustainable farming practices, strengthening food security outcomes. Third, environmental sustainability improved notably, with a 15.7% increase in clean water access, demonstrating a successful balance between economic growth and ecological protection. China emerged as the largest contributor (15.2%) to research in this field, with substantial international collaboration (42.4% of publications involving cross-border co-authorship). Despite these achievements, significant regional disparities persist, particularly between eastern and western regions, where targeted interventions are needed. The findings highlight the need for regionally tailored approaches: eastern regions require focus on sustainable intensification, western regions need fundamental infrastructure development, and central regions would benefit from strengthened urban–rural linkages. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers and researchers working on rural development initiatives while identifying areas requiring further research, particularly in long-term sustainability assessments and climate resilience strategies. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Mitigating life-cycle multiple environmental burdens while increasing ecosystem economic benefit and crop productivity with regional universal nitrogen strategy,"Introduction: Nitrogen fertiliser is critical for increasing crop yields worldwide, but excessive use causes significant N losses in various forms and subsequent environmental issues, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Establishing regional universal nitrogen strategy (RUNs) is indispensable for technology adoption, resource conservation, and pollution mitigation in crop production. Objectives: This study aims to develop a regional universal nitrogen fertilizer strategy to address variations in N application effectiveness, balancing agricultural productivity with environmental and eco-economic benefits. Methods: We conducted a total of 48 site-year field experiments including no nitrogen application (Control), farmers’ practice (FP), and the implementation of the RUNs with optimized nitrogen recommended formulas and one-off application method. Results: The RUNs significantly increased yields by 5.9%, 12%, and 11% for grain, sweet, and silage maize, respectively, compared with FP. Further, RUNs reduced life-cycle potentials of global warming, soil acidification, water eutrophication, and energy depletion by 22–45%, 63–76%, 51–73%, and 46–67%, respectively. The RUNs increased economic benefits by 11%–58.2%, and net ecosystem-economic benefits by 11.3–77.5%, particularly through the reduction of nitrogen fertiliser and labour-associated agricultural and ecological costs. Conclusion: We propose that the RUNs reconciled crop yield, resource efficiency, environmental impacts, and ecosystem economic benefits, demonstrating a regional sustainable N strategy for global food security and resource conservation. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"A global meta-analysis of yield-scaled N2O emissions and its mitigation efforts for maize, wheat, and rice","Maintaining or even increasing crop yields while reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is necessary to reconcile food security and climate change, while the metric of yield-scaled N2O emission (i.e., N2O emissions per unit of crop yield) is at present poorly understood. Here we conducted a global meta-analysis with more than 6000 observations to explore the variation patterns and controlling factors of yield-scaled N2O emissions for maize, wheat and rice and associated potential mitigation options. Our results showed that the average yield-scaled N2O emissions across all available data followed the order wheat (322 g N Mg−1, with the 95% confidence interval [CI]: 301–346) > maize (211 g N Mg−1, CI: 198–225) > rice (153 g N Mg−1, CI: 144–163). Yield-scaled N2O emissions for individual crops were generally higher in tropical or subtropical zones than in temperate zones, and also showed a trend towards lower intensities from low to high latitudes. This global variation was better explained by climatic and edaphic factors than by N fertilizer management, while their combined effect predicted more than 70% of the variance. Furthermore, our analysis showed a significant decrease in yield-scaled N2O emissions with increasing N use efficiency or in N2O emissions for production systems with cereal yields >10 Mg ha−1 (maize), 6.6 Mg ha−1 (wheat) or 6.8 Mg ha−1 (rice), respectively. This highlights that N use efficiency indicators can be used as valuable proxies for reconciling trade-offs between crop production and N2O mitigation. For all three major staple crops, reducing N fertilization by up to 30%, optimizing the timing and placement of fertilizer application or using enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers significantly reduced yield-scaled N2O emissions at similar or even higher cereal yields. Our data-driven assessment provides some key guidance for developing effective and targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies for the sustainable intensification of cereal production. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Vertical differentiation design and pricing strategy of green products based on heterogeneous consumer preference,"Increased economic activity has been accompanied by growing concerns, such as, climate change, energy security, and the scarcity of natural resources. Sustainable production requires that producers take responsibility for the environmental, social, and economic aspects of their activities. Green products, which integrate innovative technology and environmental protection design, are receiving increasing attention. Green consumers with strong environmental awareness and social responsibility, are especially willing to buy green products. Consumers now pay more attention to the impact of products on the environment, due to the development of the green economy and the improvements in environmental awareness. Furthermore, green product production behavior of an enterprise can not only shoulder social responsibility and improve environmental image, but it can also gain the enterprise a stronger market competitiveness. By recognizing the market trends and changes in consumer behavior, enterprises are beginning to design green products to attract green consumers. In reality, consumers are heterogeneous in their willingness to pay for green products. An enterprise should consider greenness during product design to match the consumer budget. In a green production system, manufacturing the alternative product is one way to meet consumers' demands. The decision to produce differentiated products with different greenness or a single product with a high level of greenness, depends on the effect of the differentiated product on the decision that can bring more profits for the enterprise. In addition to greenness, price is also a very important factor considered by enterprises. Due to the close relationship between price and greenness of the product, a higher level of greenness accompanies a higher price since greener products are usually costlier to produce. As the two key factors, greenness and price determine profit maximization. This paper studied the product differentiation design in greenness and pricing strategy considering the heterogeneous consumers' willingness to pay. First, this study focused on a single product design problem. Second, we broadened the model to a differentiation case. In the differentiation case, we considered the optimal decision with different production costs. In each case, we tried to find the critical point of the consumer's willingness to pay to support the development of the green market. At the same time, the impact of the consumer's green satisfaction and the enterprise's green technology research, and development cost on the optimal decisions, market share, and profit of green products were analyzed. Research showed the following. (1) When the consumer's willingness to pay was relatively low, the profits obtained by the green enterprise were negative, indicating there was no market for green products. When the willingness to pay was higher than a certain threshold, enterprises produced a single type of green product. With the continuous improvement of a consumer's willingness to pay, enterprises produced vertically differentiated products in terms of greenness in order to meet consumers' differentiated needs. In differentiated products, as the greenness of the product reached a higher level, the market share of the product became greater. Also, the increase in a consumer's willingness to pay increased the market share and profit of each type of product. These results suggested that when enterprises planned to produce green products, they should conduct market research on the consumer's willingness to pay, and formulate production strategies according to the actual value of the consumer's willingness to pay. (2) The improvement of the consumer' s green satisfaction will increase the market share and profit of green products. This implied that enterprises may increase environmental awareness by strengthening the promotion of green living concepts and the publicity of green products, and guide consumers to translate green awareness into practical actions by setting up banners and establishing demonstrations. However, the increase inthecost of green technology research and development reduced the market share and profit of green products. This was because as the research and development cost of green technology increased, the production cost of green products increased significantly, accompanied by rising prices. As a result, the consumer's utility of buying green products declined, leading to a reduction in demand, and ultimately the decrease of enterprise profit. Therefore, on the production side, the government can reduce thecost of green technology research and development through subsidies. Onthe demand side, enterprises and governments can also popularize the environmental value of green products through publicity and other promotional methods to improve a consumer' s willingness to pay. The main contribution of this study was obtaining the vertical differentiation design and pricing of green products considering the consumer's heterogeneous willingness to pay. It is of practical significance to study the influence of the heterogeneous consumer' s willingness to pay on the enterprise' s production decisions. Second, this paper also explored the influence of consumer green satisfaction and the cost coefficient of green technology investment on vertical differentiation design, market share, and profit of green products. The study linked consumers with companies to analyze the impact of green consumer behavior on a firm's green product decisions. This study tried to provide theoretical support for firms to design products with the consideration of the consumer' s willingness to pay. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Thresholds for Rural Public and Ecosystem Services: Integration into Rural Green Space Spatial Planning for Sustainable Development,"Rural landscapes are experiencing ecosystem degradation due to urbanization and rapid suburban expansion. Ecosystem services derived from natural resources and essential public services facilitated by social capital collectively address the growingly diverse social and ecological requirements of rural residents. Even so, ecosystem services and public services are often trade-offs, highlighting the necessity to enhance their coordinated development. However, it remains unclear how to use the identified thresholds to delineate functional zones. This will scientifically guide sound and efficient spatial planning and ecological management. This study takes the suburban countryside of Jiangning in Nanjing as the study area. It explores the inclusion of the threshold value of rural public services and ecosystem services in the strategic design of sustainable suburban development in China. First, we quantify and map six types of ecosystem services (ESs) and 13 types of rural public services (RPSs). Secondly, we use the piecewise linear regression method to identify the response and threshold of 13 types of RPSs to six kinds of ESs. Finally, the combination and classification of threshold values are used to divide functional areas, and space-specific management and planning suggestions are put forward. The results are as follows (1) With the increase in RPSs, all ESs respond with a downward trend. (2) In addition to the negative linear relationship between education and social welfare services and ESs, the response thresholds of other RPSs and ESs were identified. (3) According to multiple density threshold analysis of each RPS’s response to ESs, four functional areas were obtained. We emphasize the priority of spatial planning and management, that is, the priority management of “ESs enhancement area and RPSs optimization area”. (4) The threshold values of ESs and RPSs can be used as tools to delineate functional zones and guide the spatial planning and management of rural functional areas. In general, our research helps ensure the maximization of rural ecological benefits while also meeting the growing diversity of needs of rural residents and enabling efficient, phased, gradient, and precise spatial management of suburban rural ecosystems and public services to promote the sustainable development of suburban rural areas and realize rural revitalization. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
A novel assessment framework for analyzing the sustainability of water-energy-food nexus system from a pressure-support perspective,"Quantifying the sustainability of water-energy-food nexus system provides essential support for addressing climate change and resource scarcity. However, prior research has neglected to link the sustainability of water-energy-food nexus system to the Sustainable Development Goals and the fact that the system itself is in an unsustainable state due to pressure overload. Based on the complex feedback relationships between subsystems, a sustainability assessment framework for water-energy-food nexus system is proposed from a pressure-support perspective by integrating the Sustainable Development Goal 2, 6 and 7. Entropy and catastrophe progression method, kernel density estimation, Markov chain and Tobit model are employed to examine its effectiveness by taking the Yellow River Basin in China as a case. The outcomes indicate that, the pressure index was greater than the support index for water-energy-food nexus system in the provinces along the basin except Shandong province from 2005 to 2021. The sustainable development index within the basin increased from 0.854 in 2005 to 0.917 in 2021, but was less than 1. It is characterized by fluctuating growth, with widening differences between regions. Water-energy-food nexus system was still in an unsustainable state. The ability of the lower reach to achieve sustainability far exceeded that of the upper and middle reaches. From spatial distribution, it showed a spatial pattern of “high in the east and low in the west”, with spatial correlation effect showing “club convergence” characteristic. Foreign trade level, technological progress level, environmental regulation capacity, industrialization level, infrastructure level and rural living standard made significant contributions to improving sustainability level with marginal impacts of 0.121, 0.328, 0.604, 0.233, 0.674 and 0.083, respectively, while urbanization level had an inhibitory effect with marginal impact of −0.255. These findings provide policy guidance for the region to enhance sustainable governance of water-energy-food nexus system. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Review of microplastics in soils: state-of-the-art occurrence, transport, and investigation methods","Purpose: A number of studies have been conducted on the occurrence, transport, and fate of microplastics in soil environments. The complexity of matrices presents significant challenges in investigating microplastics in soil, highlighting the need for further research and development in this field. In this review, sampling and pretreatment methods available for detecting and further studying microplastics in soil environments are primarily focused with a minor discussion on their various sources and behavior. Finally, based on the current research findings, the directions of future research are proposed as well. Methods: Based on a comprehensive search of the available database, we provide updated information on the sources and behavior of microplastics in the soil and the analytical techniques available for their study. Results: Previous studies have predominantly focused on microplastic contamination and its levels in various environments. We propose that the focus of microplastic research needs to be redirected to allow a better understanding of the behavior and impact of soil microplastics. The novel approach involves modeling the behavior of microplastics in the soil and associated environmental impacts and risks and developing standardized testing methods. These tools will provide a comprehensive strategy for creating a healthy and safe environment. Conclusions: As plastic production increases worldwide, the accumulation of microplastics in the soil also increases, with potentially adverse implications for food security, human health, and climate change. A comprehensive strategy for rational delineation of microplastic behavior in the soil, as presented here, is needed to counteract and control the environmental impact of microplastics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Stabilizing unstable cropland towards win-win sustainable development goals,"Hundreds of millions of unstable croplands have been underutilized in the time series by repeated cultivation and abandonment, leading to threats to food security and loss of ecological benefits due to frequent disturbance on ecosystem restoration. Understanding unstable cropland and its connections to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is required in the context of increasing food demand and natural conservation. Here, we first investigate the global cropland instability and influencing factors, then simulate the stable utilization of unstable cropland and its ecological effects under different scenarios of maintaining crop production. 395 million hectares of croplands in 173 countries are found under unstable utilization, accounting for 22% of global croplands. Over three-quarters of unstable croplands are distributed in areas with unfavorable agricultural conditions or high conservation value, and countries experiencing high cropland instability share a common characteristic of climatic or terrain constraints on agriculture. According to the simulation results, 141 million hectares or 36% of the unstable croplands could be released for ecological restoration with 3.8 more billion tons of carbon sequestration, while the rest of the unstable croplands could be stably used to increase 3% of global total crop production. This study highlights the importance of managing unstable croplands in climate mitigation and natural conservation as well as reconciling crop production and other SDGs, with guiding significance for land-use management, climate action, and biodiversity conservation. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimal irrigation for wheat-maize rotation depending on precipitation in the North China Plain: Evidence from a four-year experiment,"The North China Plain (NCP) is a remarkable agricultural area with severe water scarcity and uneven precipitation, especially in wheat season. Optimizing irrigation strategies to increase water productivity (WP) and achieve higher yield in winter wheat-summer maize rotation is urgently needed and has been a persistent challenge. A four-year field experiment was conducted to explore the impact of irrigation on yield and WP of wheat and subsequent maize under different precipitation year types (dry and normal years, categorized based on the cumulative precipitation from sowing to jointing stage of wheat (P1)). Four irrigation strategies (W0, no irrigation; W1, pre-sowing irrigation; W2, pre-sowing + jointing irrigation; and W3, pre-sowing + jointing + anthesis irrigation) were adopted for wheat, and identical field operations were applied for maize. Results showed that wheat yield was affected by P1 rather than total precipitation. Irrigation improved wheat yield by enhancing evapotranspiration, spike number, grain number, and 1000-seed weight. The water-limited gap in yield and WP between W2 and W1 was significantly higher than those between W1 and W0, and between W3 and W2, implying that W2 was the suitable irrigation strategy in wheat production. Different irrigation in wheat season had no effect on subsequent maize in normal years, but W1 increased maize yield and WP by 13.2–29.3% and 16.1–41.8% compared with other treatments through decreasing soil water storage before maize sowing in dry years. Therefore, we recommended W2 to achieve higher annual yield, WP, and net income in normal years (37.6 mm < P1 < 79.9 mm); and W1 to lower irrigation water consumption and achieve higher WP and economic benefits in dry years (P1 < 37.6 mm), respectively. Overall, optimizing irrigation under different precipitation conditions is an effective strategy to cope with water resource shortages and increase crop yield and WP in the NCP. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Dual-Network Structured Nanofibrous Membranes with Superelevated Interception Probability for Extrafine Particles,"Airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution has caused a public health threat, including nanoscale particles, especially with emerging infectious diseases and indoor and vehicular environmental pollution. However, most existing indoor air filtration units are expensive, energy-intensive, and bulky, and there is an unavoidable trade-off between low-efficiency PM0.3/pathogen interception, PM removal, and air resistance. Herein, we designed and synthesized a two-dimensional continuous cellulose-sheath/net with a unique dual-network corrugated architecture to manufacture high-efficiency air filters and even N95 particulate face mask. Combined with its sheath/net structured pores (size 100-200 nm) consisting of a cellulose framework (1-100 nm diameter), the cellulose sheath/net filter offers high-efficiency air filtration (>99.5338%, Extrafine particles; >99.9999%, PM2.5), low-pressure drops, and a robustness quality factor of >0.14 Pa-1, utilizing their ultralight weight of 30 mg/m2 and physical adhesion and sieving behaviors. Simultaneously, masks prepared with cellulose-sheath/net filters are more likely to capture and block smaller particles than the N95 standard. The synthesis of such materials with their nanoscale features and designed macrostructures may suggest new design criteria for a novel generation of high-efficiency air filter media for different applications such as personal protection products and industrial dust removal. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Achieving co-benefits by implementing the low-carbon city pilot policy in China: Effectiveness and efficiency,"Cities are the main emitters of CO2 and air pollutants, and the main drivers of addressing climate change. The implementation of the low-carbon city pilot (LCCP) policy has achieved carbon emission reduction, but further research is needed to determine whether the synergistic reduction of CO2 and PM2.5 can be effectively implemented, and the efficiency of the synergistic reduction can be improved. Panel data belonging to 279 Chinese cities are selected. We assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the LCCP policy to achieve co-benefits of CO2 and PM2.5 emission reduction, using the time-varying difference-in-differences model. We evaluate the synergistic emission reduction efficiency and its decomposition by the super-efficiency slack-based measure model with CO2 and PM2.5 as undesirable outputs. The results show that the LCCP policy reduces 3.55% of CO2 and 2.18% of PM2.5 respectively, and enhances the effectiveness of coordinated emission reduction governance. The LCCP policy also improves the synergistic emission reduction efficiency, moves the input–output model towards the “optimal production frontier”. We form policy recommendations for encouraging technological innovation and optimal resource allocation to achieve “net zero emissions”. Most importantly, policymakers should incorporate synergistic emission reduction efficiency into the process of policy evaluation, and establish a low-carbon economic development model tailored to local conditions. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Economic-Environmental Law Guarantee of the Green and Sustainable Development: Role of Health Expenditure and Innovation,"Environmental regulation is a tool for teaching social and fiscal development that is carbon neutral. The highly polluting food industry in China is a threat to the country's long-term environmental stability and affects public health in a significant way. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of environmental parameters on environmental quality in China's food industry using the cross-sectionally augmented ARDL (CS-ARDL) model over the period of 2010 to 2019. We find that environmental regulations negatively and significantly impact environmental quality. The U-shape relationship exists between environmental regulation and environmental quality. Moreover, government expenditure on health and technological innovation reduces carbon emissions. The study's findings suggest new policy implications supporting the Porter Hypothesis. Finally, this paper offers policy suggestions for China's food industry to enhance its environmental performance. Copyright © 2022 Yang.",Not About Sufficiency
Prioritizing sustainable development goals and linking them to ecosystem services: A global expert's knowledge evaluation,"The implementation of strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is frequently hindered by potential trade-offs between priorities for either environmental protection or human well-being. However, ecosystem services (ES)-based solutions can offer possible co-benefits for SDGs implementation that are often overlooked or underexploited. In this study, we cover this gap and investigate how experts from different countries value the SDGs and relate them with ES. A total of 66 countries participated to the survey, and answers were grouped into three macro-regions: Asia; Europe, North America, and Oceania (ENO); Latin America, Caribbean and Africa (LA). Results show that the most prioritized SDGs in the three macro-regions are usually those related to essential material needs and environmental conditions, such as SDG2 (Zero Hunger), SDG1 (No Poverty), and SDG6 (Clean Water). At a global scale, the number of prioritized synergies between SDGs and ES largely exceeded trade-offs. The highest amount of synergies was observed for SDG1 (No Poverty), mainly with SDG2, SDG3 (Good Health), SDG5 (Gender Equality), and SDG8 (Economic Growth). Other major synergies among SDGs include SDG14-15 (Life below water - Life on land), SDG5-10 (Gender Equity - Reduced Inequality), and SDG1-2 (No poverty - Zero Hunger). At a global scale, SDG15, SDG13, SDG14, and SDG6 were closely related to ES like climate regulation, freshwater, food, water purification, biodiversity, and education. SDG11 (Sustainable Cities) and SDG3 were also relevant in Asia and in LA, respectively. Overall, this study shows the potential to couple future policies that can implement SDGs' strategies while adopting ES-based solutions in different regions of the world. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency
Implementation of an Intelligent Indoor Environmental Monitoring and management system in cloud,"Indoor environmental monitoring and management system has played an essential role in public health sustainability. By monitoring the indoor air quality in public areas such as schools, offices, home or other buildings, the authorities will be given a better picture of the indoor air quality to take the right steps to ensure the better air quality for people inside the buildings. This system also can give information about indoor air quality information for the society. Therefore, to achieve this goal, we need to develop a monitoring system by using Information Technology based on Big Data and Cloud Computing environment to give warning. In this paper, we propose Intelligent Indoor Environment Monitoring System (iDEMS) combined with ZigBee wireless sensor network technology to store and process environmental data in HBase. The mechanism of the proposed system is classified into three stages: data collection, data processing, and information monitoring. To understand an Intelligent Indoor Environmental Monitoring, first, we collected the gas from Intelligent Indoor Environmental Monitoring through the environmental sensors with ZigBee wireless sensor network technology. We build a platform for iDEMS to collect the data related to the indoor gases. Second, the environmental data collected in the first stage will be stored and processed in HBase which support massive data storage and free to increase storage capacity for the analysis and processing of Big Data. In this stage, we also compared several data-input methods to import data in HBase much more efficient. Third, the intelligent-control socket is integrated into iDEMS and give the warning if the air quality exceeds the absolute legal limit based on the air quality index rule from the authority. Finally, iDEMS presents the resulting information by a web-based Monitoring Platform so that users can use the Internet to monitor the environment and enable them to utilize these informed decisions on managing and improving the environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental efficiency and equality embodied in China's inter-regional trade,"Embodied emissions in trade have been widely studied; however, there is still a lack of studies that explore whether a country is benefitting from its inter-regional trade in terms of pollutant emissions. This study took sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions as an example and employed modified input-output (MIO) model and traditional input-output (IO) model to quantify emissions under no-trade and trade conditions, and further investigated environmental efficiency and equality of inter-regional trade in China in 2010. The results show that inter-regional trade had increased emissions by 28% compared to no-trade emissions, which confirms the environmental inefficiency of inter-regional trade in China. This was largely because regions with better technology and low emission intensities tended to outsource the production of pollution-intensive but low value-added goods to regions with high emission intensities through inter-regional trade. The exchanges of pollution-intensive products in inter-regional trade have led to notable environmental inequities. Eastern regions usually gained the greatest environmental benefits from trade, while central regions (especially Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei) suffered the largest environmental loss induced by trade. Specifically, Guangdong plundered other regions the most (796 G gram (Gg)), while Shanxi was plundered the most by other regions (790 Gg). Polices to differentiate reduction criteria for emission intensity in different regions and adjust trade patterns within China could be recommended in order to achieve trade-related environmental efficiency as well as environmental equality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
China's regional balanced development based on the investment in power grid infrastructure,"Due to the stark reality of regional development disparities, China has to confront the sustainable development challenges brought about by social inequality. To compensate for these regional differences in natural resource endowments, effective investment in power grid infrastructure (PGI) and improvement of power grids might prove helpful in reducing poverty and narrowing the development gap. This paper constructs a ""Peripheral Degree Index"" (PDI) of power grid to measure the effective distance between electricity delivering areas and receiving regions. Moreover we discuss how to efficiently locate the investment in PGI and optimize the allocation of limited financial resources. The results show investment in PGI has higher marginal benefit for less developed provinces in energy delivering regions; and more importantly, improvement of the grid infrastructure in central areas which connect energy receiving and delivering regions. Particularly, to improve the grid facilities in the central areas could reduce electricity transmission cost and help to alleviate the railway strain for coal transportation. Therefore, our findings suggest that it is more advisable to locate the investment of power grid infrastructure in the central provinces that are located at strategic conjunctions of the nationwide power grid, including Shanxi, Henan, Hubei and Hebei. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

China's regional water scarcity and implications for grain supply and trade,"In this paper we highlight the water scarcity and resource depletion in the North China Plain, the 'breadbasket' of China. A projection of water demand in the region indicates a continuous aggravation in water deficit in the coming years. Analyses of countermeasures on the supply and demand side suggest that the conventional wisdom of 'opening up new sources and economising on the use of resources' may not be an optimal way to deal with water scarcity in the region. Importing water in the form of grain should be taken as an additional measure. This 'virtual water import' option needs to be incorporated into the current regional and national agricultural development strategy in which crop structural adjustment is at the core.",Not About Sufficiency
"China's Surplus Agricultural Labour Force: It's Size, Transfer, Prospects for Absorption and Effects of the Double‐Track Economic System","The commune economy had two basic characteristics: one was its three‐grade pyramid‐type structure of organisation which integrated government administration and economic management; and the other was its “self‐sufficient” and “closed‐door” character. Under this system farmers had no free choice about their occupation and place of residence. With the collapse of the commune system, institutional reorganisation of China's rural economy occurred. Farmers had more choice now about their production, their occupation and place of residence based on the development of a modern commodity and market economy. In this process of institutional reorganisation, transfer of surplus agricultural labour is a key factor. The concept of the agricultural labour surplus is discussed and discussions in English of this concept and associated theory and policy are reviewed. With reform of rural economy and improvement of agricultural labour productivity, the quantity of surplus labour in rural China has increased. Greater labour absorption is required in both agricultural and non‐agricultural sectors, but particularly in non‐agricultural sectors. In China, several impediments to transfer of surplus agricultural labour still exist. The transfer of surplus agricultural labour in contemporary China occurs in the context of a nationwide “double‐track” economic system (a market‐oriented economic system harnessed to a centrally planned and controlled economic system) and a “dual economy” in which modern industries exist alongside a traditional indigenous agricultural economy. Income gains provide the main motivation for farmers to transfer to non‐agricultural activities. It is the income difference between farming and non‐farming activity, not whether the marginal labour productivity in farming is zero that is important. By building and developing free or open markets one provides a suitable climate for labour transfer and migration. In the absence of free or open markets, farmers have little free choice. The continuing system of household registration is a serious institutional barrier to transfer or migration by farmers. Furthermore, the system of equal farmland contracts also hinders the process of transfer or migration. This might be overcome by allowing the transfer of rights to use farmland and facilitating “part‐time” transfer of agricultural labour. Withdrawal of “surplus labour” from farming can cause grain output to drop. This can occur because if “better” farmers leave agriculture, the quality of farm labourers as a whole declines and because of a rigid price system which discriminates against agricultural products. While current transfers of surplus agricultural labour in China may well have increased income inequality between rural residents and between regions, if there had been greater freedom of migration this might have resulted in less income inequality. To the extent that market reform in China has resulted in greater freedom of economic choice, it appears to have increased the level of production obtained from China's limited resources. This is not to say that the market system will result in a perfect solution even though the economic results can be expected to be much superior to the commune system adopted in the past by China.

The unearthed and contagious logics of pluralist climate justice in the Russian Arctic,"This chapter explores how discourses of economic development and environmental protection coexist and relate to the socially relevant issues of climate justice in the Russian Arctic. Half of the global Arctic population live in the Arctic regions of Russia, making this example especially relevant. The Arctic is widely discussed in the contexts of climate change, natural resources, and indigenous rights. Global warming is most visible in the Arctic. These environment changes are happening at a much faster rate than in other regions of the Earth. The warming Arctic accelerates global climate change, but its immediate impact poses urgent social and economic risks to local communities and nations. The Arctic Ocean has the potential to transform world shipping routes due to longer ice-free navigation periods. The melting tundra lures energy giants with vast fossil fuel reserves, but its sensitive ecosystems remain vital for smaller local economies and lifestyles. This study of Arctic climate change discourse in Russia takes into account differences between national and regional debates through the analysis of public communication materials (media reports, speeches and public relations). © David C Holmes and Lucy M Richardson 2020.

Potential and promisingness of technical options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation in Southeast Asian countries,"Paddy fields are considered as one of the most important sources of anthropogenic methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. While several technical options have been proposed to reduce these emissions, gaps in data and information based on application of these options in the field are a key barrier to scaling-up. To address these gaps, we conducted a review of literature to analyze the potential of technical options in Southeast Asia (SEA). Using screening criteria based on reliability of experimental data, 31 region-specific cases were selected for the analysis. A meta-analysis indicated that water management options, including single and multiple drainage approaches such as alternative wetting and drying (AWD), significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 35% as a mean effect size (95% confidential interval: 41–29%), as well as the combined effects of CH4+N2O (net GWP) by 29% (36–23%). The effect on reducing CH4 emissions in the dry season was significantly larger than that in the wet season. Application of biochar reduced both CH4 and N2O emissions by 20% (40% to −7%), while significantly increased rice yield by 28% (8–52%). Other options such as removal of rice straw from the previous crop, composting rice straw and manure, application of sulfate-containing fertilizer, and soil drying in the fallow season also have recognized potential to reduce emissions but require further data and consideration of possible trade-offs. Based on the analysis of mitigation potential, promising technical options were assessed by considering together with constraints and additional co-benefits in order to provide a useful guide for policy makers and rice value chain operators in SEA countries for adopting mitigation options in rice cultivation to tackle climate change and enhance agriculture sector sustainability. © 2019, © 2019 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy–poverty–climate vulnerability nexus: an approach to sustainable development for the poorest of poor,"The livelihood of indigenous people, residing in the forest fringe area of developing countries like India, are primarily dependent on the forest. These forest fringe communities represent the country’s poorest people and are the most vulnerable due to their high dependency on natural resources, lack of energy, unemployment, poor quality of life and poor socio-economic conditions. Additionally, climate change and lesser adaptive capacity have further exacerbated their struggle to meet their livelihoods. Thus, alleviating poverty, strengthening adaptive capacity to climate change and improving energy access are interlinked and complementary to each other, forming an energy–poverty–climate nexus. The study attempted to understand and analyse the nexus between poverty, energy access and climate vulnerability of the most impoverished villages of India. The study was conducted in 29 forest fringe villages, spread in Mandla and Hoshangabad districts of the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The state has the distinction of having the highest forest cover and tribal population in the country. A detailed household survey was conducted to assess poverty, climate vulnerability and energy access of 325 households by using progress out of poverty index (PPI), climate change vulnerability index (CCVI) and energy access index (EAI), respectively. The data were collected through interview sessions with the respondents in the regional language. After computing scores of all indices, correlation, regression and chi-square were applied to test the integration of these three variables to understand the energy–poverty–climate nexus. The study found a nexus between energy access, poverty and climate vulnerability and also identified 14 indicators, which significantly influenced the nexus. These indicators were related to agriculture, energy, income and infrastructure, and education and awareness that together help to form an institutional framework for sustainable development. The framework suggests the formation of a block-level committee for monitoring and evaluation, a district-level committee for mobilizing funds, and a state-level inter-departmental committee for planning and implementation. Furthermore, the analysis on scores of different indices revealed that parameters like economic class, type of livelihood options/occupation and education level of a household may be the appropriate indicators for the selection of households to prioritize the target beneficiaries of programmes and policies related to poverty, energy and climate change in the forest fringe villages of India. Based on this, a site-specific framework was designed to act and prioritize programme implementation to achieve sustainable development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Semantic Carbon Footprint of Food Supply Chain Management,"Currently climate change poses a significant challenge to us, both now and as we head into the future. Several individuals endeavour to adopt more sustainable lifestyles, ensuring that our daily choices do not have adverse impact on our planet. Under the umbrella of sustainability, food stands out as an area of specific emphasis, specifically regarding the environmental aspects of our selected diet and the ways we can make decisions that reduce the negative impacts. It is challenging to figure out how to effectively model the environmental impact of food production in a way that is useful to food manufacturers, consumers, and other individuals concerned about sustainability. To tackle this challenge, an ontology and a knowledge graph have been developed to assess the CO2 emissions generated throughout the several stages of food manufacturing and distribution. This comprehensive approach leads as a significant indicator of environmental impact, explores potential alternatives, and provides a comparison of CO2 emissions. Our work focuses specifically on assessing the environmental consequences of food production, primarily through the measurement of CO2 emissions. We consider key factors such as animal feeding, land usage, and transportation within this scope. The data to test our approach is coming from various open-source datasets such as the Food Emissions Dataset, Nutrition Facts Dataset, etc. Several use-cases have been simulated to validate the usability and efficiency of the work. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Pricing and Procurement Strategies for Substitute Products in Extreme Weather,"Climate change is causing frequent extreme weather events, posing disruption risks to supply chains. A two-echelon supply chain comprising two suppliers and one retailer is constructed from a risk perspective. A game theory model is utilized to analyze all parties' optimal decisions and risk management measures under climate disturbances. The reactions of the retailer and suppliers, who sell vertically differentiated substitute products, are examined, and the changes in social welfare are observed. Our analysis exhibits that (1) the retailer mitigated the negative impact of risk disturbance through product differentiation and pricing strategies and even achieved higher profits than without extreme weather events; (2) there is a possibility that the sales volume will be higher in extreme weather, which is related to the antidisturbance ability of the supply chain; and (3) although extreme weather disturbs the supply, it may lead to a win–win relationship between retailer's profit and social welfare. The operational decisions derived from this study exhibit robustness in mitigating the adverse effects of extreme weather, enabling maximization of both retailers' profits and social welfare, thus contributing to the theoretical foundation for sustainable socioeconomic systems. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating the Effect of Deficit Irrigation on Yield and Water Use Efficiency of Drip Irrigation Cotton under Film in Xinjiang Based on Meta-Analysis,"Water scarcity constrains the sustainable development of Chinese agriculture, and deficit irrigation as a new irrigation technology can effectively alleviate the problems of water scarcity and water use inefficiency in agriculture. In this study, the drip irrigation cotton field under film in Xinjiang was taken as the research object. Meta-analysis and machine learning were used to quantitatively analyze the effects of different farm management practices, climate, and soil conditions on cotton yield and water use efficiency under deficit irrigation, to investigate the importance of the effects of different factors on cotton yield and water use efficiency, and to formulate appropriate optimization strategies. The results showed that deficit irrigation significantly increased cotton water use efficiency (7.39%) but decreased cotton yield (−15.00%) compared with full irrigation. All three deficit irrigation levels (80~100% FI, 60~80% FI, and 40~60% FI; FI: full irrigation) showed a significant decrease in cotton yield and a significant increase in water use efficiency. Under deficit irrigation, cotton yield reduction was the smallest and cotton water use efficiency increased the most when planted with one film, two tubes, a six-row cropping pattern, an irrigation frequency ≥10 times, a nitrogen application of 300~400 kg·ha−1, and a crop density ≥240,000 per hectare, and planted with the Xinluzhong series of cotton varieties; deficit irrigation in areas with average annual temperature >10 °C, annual evapotranspiration >2000 mm, annual precipitation <60 mm, and with loam, sandy soil had the least inhibition of cotton yield and the greatest increase in cotton water use efficiency. The results of the random forest showed that the irrigation amount and nitrogen application had the greatest influence on cotton yield and water use efficiency. Rational irrigation based on optimal management practices under conditions of irrigation not less than 90% FI is expected to achieve a win–win situation for both cotton yield and water use efficiency. The above results can provide the best strategy for deficit irrigation and efficient water use in drip irrigation cotton under film in arid areas. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring the triple burden of social disadvantage, mobility poverty, and exposure to traffic-related air pollution","Understanding the relationships between ultrafine particle (UFP) exposure, socioeconomic status (SES), and sustainable transportation accessibility in Toronto, Canada is crucial for promoting public health, addressing environmental justice, and ensuring transportation equity. We conducted a large-scale mobile measurement campaign and employed a gradient boost model to generate exposure surfaces using land use, built environment, and meteorological conditions. The Ontario Marginalization Index was used to quantify various indicators of social disadvantage for Toronto's neighborhoods. Our findings reveal that people in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas experience elevated UFP exposures. We highlight significant disparities in accessing sustainable transportation, particularly in areas with higher ethnic concentrations. When factoring in daily mobility, UFP exposure disparities in disadvantaged populations are further exacerbated. Furthermore, individuals who do not generate emissions themselves are consistently exposed to higher UFPs, with active transportation users experiencing the highest UFP exposures both at home and at activity locations. Finally, we proposed a novel index, the Community Prioritization Index (CPI), incorporating three indicators, including air quality, social disadvantage, and sustainable transportation. This index identifies neighborhoods experiencing a triple burden, often situated near major infrastructure hubs with high diesel truck activity and lacking greenspace, marking them as high-priority areas for policy action and targeted interventions. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
An estimation of future county-level cement production and associated air pollutant emissions in China through artificial neural networks,"Cement production and its air pollutant and carbon dioxides (CO2) emissions in China will be relocated greatly as a joint effect of diverse development of industrial economy and implementation of environmental policies for different regions. The future pathway and spatial pattern of emissions are important for policy making of air quality improvement and CO2 emission abatement, as well as coordinating regional development. In this study, we developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict cement production at the county level and to calculate the associated emissions of air pollutants and CO2 at the county level till 2060. Results show that the cement production will decline from 2327 million metric tons (Mt) in 2015 to 704 Mt. in 2060 under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 1 (SSP1). Counties closer to provincial capital will experience greater retirement of cement industry. Likewise, the emissions of air pollutants and CO2 will experience a steady downward trend driven by the declining cement production and the improvement of pollution control technologies. There will be a more significant regional heterogeneity in the reduction of production and emissions at city level compared to the province level. With the clearance for nearly two-thirds of counties, future cement production and emissions will be more intensively distributed in a few cities. The shares of emissions in southwestern regions will grow from 2015 to 2060 while those of eastern regions will continue decreasing. The comparison between the changing spatial distributions of emissions and gross domestic product (GDP) indicates a positive effect of existing policies in reconciling regional economic development and air pollution controls. The outcome could support the analyses on the impact of industrial development on air quality and public health, and the method can be applied widely for other industrial sectors for a more comprehensive understanding of future emission relocation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
A comparative study of renewable and fossil fuels energy impacts on green development in Asian countries with divergent income inequality,"The paper aims to analyze the impacts of renewable and non-renewable energy resources on the Sustainable Development Index in 16 Asian countries with a high GINI index and 13 Asian countries with a low GINI index from 2000 to 2021, utilizing the ARDL (Auto Regressive Distributed Lag) - PMG (Pooled Mean Group) estimation approach. Empirical evidence suggests that fossil fuel has a detrimental effect on the Sustainable Development Index. Conversely, the development of clean energy shows only short-term positive effects in Asian countries with a low GINI coefficient. Notably, green financing emerges as a crucial contributing factor to the Sustainable Development Index. To implement practical policies, it is essential to focus on developing green financing tools within digital platforms and leveraging Fintech capabilities. Furthermore, expanding financial inclusion and enhancing economic resiliency status are identified as critical strategies to bolster the Sustainable Development Index. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Modelling land system evolution and dynamics of terrestrial carbon stocks in the Luanhe River Basin, China: a scenario analysis of trade-offs and synergies between sustainable development goals","A more holistic understanding of land use and land cover (LULC) will help minimise trade-offs and maximise synergies, and lead to improved future land use management strategies for the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, current assessments of future LULC changes rarely focus on the multiple demands for goods and services, which are related to the synergies and trade-offs between SDGs and their targets. In this study, the land system (combinations of land cover and land use intensity) evolution trajectories of the Luanhe River Basin (LRB), China, and major challenges that the LRB may face in 2030, were explored by applying the CLUMondo and InVEST models. The results indicate that the LRB is likely to experience agricultural intensification and urban growth under all four scenarios that were explored. The cropland intensity and the urban growth rate were much higher under the historical trend (Trend) scenario compared to those with more planning interventions (Expansion, Sustainability, and Conservation scenarios). Unless the forest area and biodiversity conservation targets are implemented (Conservation scenario), the forest areas are projected to decrease by 2030. The results indicate that water scarcity in the LRB is likely to increase under all scenarios, and the carbon storage will increase under the Conservation scenario but decrease under all other scenarios by 2030. Our methodological framework and findings can guide regional sustainable development in the LRB and other large river basins in China, and will be valuable for policy and planning purposes to the pursuance of SDGs at the sub-national scale. © 2021, Crown.",Not About Sufficiency
Estimation of ambient PM2.5-related mortality burden in China by 2030 under climate and population change scenarios: A modeling study,"Background: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution is one of the most critical environmental and public health problems in China and has caused an enormous disease burden, especially long-term PM2.5 exposure. Global climate change represents another environmental challenge in the coming decades and is also an essential factor affecting PM2.5 pollution. Moreover, China has an aging population with a changing population size and falling age-standardized mortality rates. However, little evidence exists evaluating the potential impacts from climate change and population aging on the long-term PM2.5 exposure-related disease burden. This study quantifies the impacts of climate and population changes on changes in the disease burden attributed to long-term PM2.5 exposure from 2015 to 2030 in mainland China, which could add evidence for the revision of relevant environmental standards and health policies. Methods: This modeling study investigated long-term PM2.5 exposure-related mortality across China based on PM2.5 projections under Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and population scenarios from shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). PM2.5 concentrations were simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling systems. In addition, three types of population projections in 2030 relative to 2015 were set up as follows: (i) the population remained the same as that in 2015; (ii) the population size changed under SSPs, but the age structure remained the same; (iii) both the population size and age structure changed under SSPs. The global exposure mortality model (GEMM) was adopted to estimate PM2.5-related premature deaths. Results: Ambient PM2.5 concentrations decreased from 2015 to 2030 under the two climate and emission scenarios. Estimates of related premature mortality in 2030 declined compared with that in 2015 due to lower PM2.5 concentrations (RCP4.5: −16.8%; RCP8.5: −16.4%). If the age structure of the population remained unchanged and the population size changed under SSPs, the nonaccidental premature mortality also showed a decrease ranging from −18.6% to −14.9%. When both population size and age structure changed under SSPs, the population in China would become older. Nonaccidental premature mortality would sharply increase by 35.7–52.3% (with a net increase of 666–977 thousand) in 2030. Conclusion: The PM2.5 pollution in 2030 under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 would slightly improve. The population sizes in 2030 projected by SSPs are relatively stable compared with that in 2015. However, the modest decrease due to air pollution improvement and stable population size would be offset by population aging. © 2021 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
A multi-site evaluation of winter hardiness in indigenous alfalfa cultivars in northern China,"Integration of perennial grass species into the current food production systems, especially in the agropastoral regions worldwide, may produce multiple benefits including, among others, a more stable productivity and a smaller eco-environmental footprint. However, one of the fundamental challenges facing the large-scale adoption of such grass species is their ability to withstand the vagaries of winter in these regions. Here, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the winter hardiness of 50 indigenous Chinese cultivars of alfalfa, a high-quality leguminous perennial grass, in comparison with six introduced U.S. cultivars in a multi-site field experiment in northern China. Our results reveal that indigenous cultivars have stronger winter hardiness than introduced cultivars. Cultivars native in the north performed better than southern cultivars, suggesting that suitability evaluation is an unavoidable step proceeding any regional implementations. Our results also show that the metric we used to assess alfalfa’s winter hardiness, the average score index (ASI), produced more consistent results than another more-widely used metric of winter survival rate (WSR). These findings offer a systematic field evidence that supports regional cropping system adjustment and production system betterment to ensure food security under climate change in the region and beyond. © 2021 by the authors.

Unraveling environmental justice in ambient PM 2.5 exposure in Beijing: A big data approach,"Air pollution imposes significant environmental and health risks worldwide and is expected to deteriorate in the coming decade as cities expand. Measuring population exposure to air pollution is crucial to quantifying risks to public health. In this work, we introduce a big data analytics framework to model residents’ stay and commuters’ travel exposure to outdoor PM 2.5 and evaluate their environmental justice, with Beijing as an example. Using mobile phone and census data, we first infer travel demand of the population to derive residents’ stay activities in each analysis zone, and then focus on commuters and estimate their travel routes with a traffic assignment model. Based on air quality observations from monitoring stations and a spatial interpolation model, we estimate the outdoor PM 2.5 concentrations at a 500-m grid level and map them to road networks. We then estimate the travel exposure for each road segment by multiplying the PM 2.5 concentration and travel time spent on the road. By combining the estimated PM 2.5 exposure and housing price harnessed from online housing transaction platforms, we discover that in the winter, Beijing commuters with low wealth level are exposed to 13% more PM 2.5 per hour than those with high wealth level when staying at home, but exposed to less PM 2.5 by 5% when commuting the same distance (due to lighter traffic congestion in suburban areas). We also find that the residents from the southern suburbs of Beijing have both lower level of wealth and higher stay- and travel- exposure to PM 2.5 , especially in the winter. These findings inform more equitable environmental mitigation policies for future sustainable development in Beijing. Finally, or the first time in the literature, we compare the results of exposure estimated from passive data with subjective measures of perceived air quality (PAQ) from a survey. The PAQ data was collected via a mobile-app. The comparison confirms consistencies in results and the advantages of the big data for air pollution exposure assessments. © 2018",Not About Sufficiency

A projected turning point in China's CO2 emissions - An environmental kuznets curve analysis,"This paper examines the possible existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) relationship between China's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per capita (CO2/capita) and GDP per capita (GDP/capita) during the period 1980-2008. The timing of the turning point in China's CO 2/capita can be further estimated if an EKC relationship exists. In regression results, a natural logarithm-quadratic relationship was found between CO2/capita and GDP/capita, which supports the EKC hypothesis. However, China's CO2 emissions are still on a growing track until around 2078 in empirical analysis. More importantly, CO2 emissions will not spontaneously decrease if China continues to develop its economy without adopting instruments for mitigating climate change. China's wealth gap and China's role in international trade are discussed as two possible factors to affect EKC hypothesis. Therefore, reduction in domestic income inequality and negotiations to allocate responsibilities between China and developed countries for CO2 emissions associated with China's exports are suggested as further efforts.

Down-scale analysis for water scarcity in response to soil-water conservation on Loess Plateau of China,"Water scarcity is one of the most prominent issues of discussion worldwide concerned with sustainable development, especially in the arid and semi-arid areas. On the Loess Plateau of China, population growth and fast-growing cities and industries have caused ever-increasing competition for water. The present paper shows a down-scale analysis on how the region wide mass action of soil-water conservation ecologically influenced regional water scarcity on the Loess Plateau, the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River of China. Result shows a great progress has been achieved in erosion control and food production since the 1980s. About 24% of erosion area has been controlled. Grain yield has increased greatly and sediment in the Yellow River has decreased by about 25%. However, various sources of evidence show that the soil-water conservation measures might have played a significant role on regional hydrocycles, leading to the depletion of deep soil water and reduced runoff in the Yellow River and consequently ecological problems. The study implies that cropland and forest plantations are increasingly suffering water stress. Advancing sustainable development further, or even maintaining the current situation, will be a great challenge given the burgeoning socio-economic development of the area combined with global climatic change. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

"Does Carbon Emissions, and Economic Expansion Induce Health Expenditure in China: Evidence for Sustainability Perspective","The current paper assesses the drivers of health care expenditure such as urbanization, natural resources, economic expansion, and CO2 utilizing quarterly data from 2000Q1 to 2018Q4. The research applied the novel dual adjustment approach to identify the long run association between healthcare expenditure and urbanization, economic growth, natural resource and CO2 emissions. The main novelty of the dual adjustment approach is that the approach offers another way to cointegration analysis by relaxing the implicit assumption of the singular adjustment in cointegration analysis. The outcome of the dual adjustment approach affirmed cointegration among the variables in the long run. Furthermore, we applied fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) and canonical cointegrating regression (CCR) estimators and their results disclosed that economic growth, urbanization, and CO2 emissions increase health care expenditure while natural resource rent mitigates healthcare expenditure in China. Moreover, the spectral causality test uncovered that urbanization, economic growth, natural resource, and CO2 emissions can predict healthcare expenditure at various frequencies. Based on these findings, China’s policymakers should establish strategic environmental management policies that improve healthy and clean air to reduce healthcare costs. In addition, policymakers in China should reevaluate their urban development strategies to avoid negative externalities associated with fast urbanization.

"Temporal-spatial variation and regulatory mechanism of carbon budgets in territorial space through the lens of carbon balance: A case of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River urban agglomerations, China","As China's largest cross-regional urban agglomerations, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River urban agglomerations (MRYRUA) possess both significant societal carbon source volume and ecological carbon sequestration capacity. Nevertheless, with the uncontrolled expansion of urban energy consumption activities and the industry migration from eastern coastal regions to inland cities, the carbon budget pattern of territorial space is increasingly unbalanced in the MRYRUA. To achieve low-carbon regulation, this study utilized land use and energy consumption data from 31 cities within the MRYRUA to establish a “carbon source-carbon sink” quantification and spatiotemporal exploration model, revealing the spatial-temporal variation of carbon budgets from 2005 to 2020. Furthermore, we developed a carbon balance indicator analysis system by employing the carbon offset rate (COR), carbon productivity (CP), Gini coefficient, ecological support coefficient (ESC), economic contribution coefficient (ECC), and functional zoning was performed. Finally, using the GM (1,1) model, we derived the carbon budget pattern for 2050 and explored the differentiated regulatory mechanisms under the carbon balance perspective. The results indicated that: (1) The MRYRUA's territorial carbon budgets have increased annually, displaying a spatial distribution pattern with the highest values in the central region, followed by the northwest, and the lowest in the southeast near water bodies. The spatiotemporal differentiation effects manifest as an east–west axial development trend, with spatiotemporal clustering effects demonstrating a propensity for outward dispersion from the northern hot spot radiation core. (2) The MRYRUA's COR has consistently remained below 10% and decreased annually, while the CP has shown a yearly increase at an accelerating rate. The ESC and ECC exhibit evident spatial heterogeneity among cities. In response to the carbon emission economic benefits and carbon sequestration ecological carrying capacity reflected by carbon balance indicators, each city was classified into low-carbon economic zones, carbon intensity control zones, carbon sink functional zones, and high-carbon optimization zones. (3) From 2020 to 2050, the polarization trend of the carbon budget pattern continues to intensify. Subsequently, we have established a differentiated territorial spatial carbon balance regulatory mechanism. This mechanism strengthens the leading role of low-carbon economic zones in the green low-carbon transition, moderately retains the carbon sink functional zones in the southeast with solid carbon fixation capabilities, and promotes the transition of the northern carbon intensity control zones and high-carbon optimization zones to low-carbon economic zones. The research findings provide a scientific basis for formulating territorial spatial planning policies from a carbon neutrality perspective. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Resilient-Smart Cities: Theoretical Insights,"Cities, the main settlements of human beings, are facing mega challenges of climate change, urbanization, population increase, economic growth, and environmental deterioration. To address such challenges, the goal of sustainable cities and communities has been advocated by the United Nations. In particular, smart city has been applied to integrate digital technologies and sensors to improve the efficiency of assets, resources, and services in urban operations. In comparison, the resilient city is expected to improve urban resilience (e.g., prevention, impact reduction, recovery, adaptation) to disasters and emergencies. However, limited studies have analyzed how to ensure a normal condition for smart city under extreme conditions and how to ensure a resilient city can efficiently respond to disasters and extreme events. Therefore, this chapter aims to address such research gaps for the integration of smart city and resilient city, namely resilient-smart city, in order to better ensure sustainable urban development under various mega challenges. This chapter discusses how six components of smart city (i.e., governance, people, life, mobility, economy, and environment) contribute the resilient city in four aspects of health and well-being, economy and society, urban systems and services, and leadership and strategy to indicate the possibilities of the integration of smart city and resilient city. Moreover, this chapter points out challenges hindering resilient-smart city development and provides corresponding suggestions to overcome such challenges. Overall, this chapter is expected to open a vision for further development of resilient-smart cities that can contribute to the achievement of sustainable urban development goals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Non-cooperative and cooperative environmental R&D under environmental corporate social responsibility with green managerial coordination,"We consider a polluting Cournot duopoly within a managerial delegation framework and examine conflicting environmental concerns in which the owners pursue strategic environmental corporate social responsibility (ECSR) while the managers undertake diverged environmental research and development (ER&D) investment. We investigate the effects of cooperation in both ECSR and ER&D on a firm's profitability and social welfare and find that managerial coordination has a critical effect on industry emissions, profits, and welfare. In the context of an optimal emissions tax, we show that managerial coordination failure might not occur, but it reduces welfare if the environmental damage is relatively high. We conclude that a pro-environmental government should encourage cooperative ER&D, especially when owners adopt cooperative ECSR. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
A cooperative reduction model for regional air pollution control in China that considers adverse health effects and pollutant reduction costs,"How to effectively control severe regional air pollution has become a focus of global concern recently. The non-cooperative reduction model (NCRM) is still the main air pollution control pattern in China, but it is both ineffective and costly, because each province must independently fight air pollution. Thus, we proposed a cooperative reduction model (CRM), with the goal of maximizing the reduction in adverse health effects (AHEs) at the lowest cost by encouraging neighboring areas to jointly control air pollution. CRM has two parts: a model of optimal pollutant removal rates using two optimization objectives (maximizing the reduction in AHEs and minimizing pollutant reduction cost) while meeting the regional pollution control targets set by the central government, and a model that allocates the cooperation benefits (i.e., health improvement and cost reduction) among the participants according to their contributions using the Shapley value method. We applied CRM to the case of sulfur dioxide (SO2) reduction in Yangtze River Delta region. Based on data from 2003 to 2013, and using mortality due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as the health endpoints, CRM saves 437 more lives than NCRM, amounting to 12.1% of the reduction under NCRM. CRM also reduced costs by US $65.8 × 106 compared with NCRM, which is 5.2% of the total cost of NCRM. Thus, CRM performs significantly better than NCRM. Each province obtains significant benefits from cooperation, which can motivate them to actively cooperate in the long term. A sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the effects of parameter values on the cooperation benefits. Results shown that the CRM is not sensitive to the changes in each province's pollutant carrying capacity and the minimum pollutant removal capacity, but sensitive to the maximum pollutant reduction capacity. Moreover, higher cooperation benefits will be generated when a province's maximum pollutant reduction capacity increases. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Assessment of coupling coordinated degree and driving mechanism of population-resource-environment-economy (PREE) system in Yellow River Basin, China","Rapid urbanization and industrialization in China have brought economic growth and improved living standards, while environmental degradation and resource overexploitation occurred simultaneously. Yellow River Basin (YRB) also faces priorities of ecological protection and high-quality development. Therefore, it is essential for YRB to coordinate the relationship between socioeconomic and eco-environment. This study constructed a population-resource-environment-economy (PREE) system to evaluate basin sustainable development from 2011 to 2021, along with the entropy-TOPSIS method, coupling coordination degree model (CCDM), spatial autocorrelation method, Kernel density estimation, and GeoDetector model, to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution, spatial agglomeration characteristics, evolutionary trends, and driving mechanism. The results revealed that: (1) CCD in the YRB was at a medium level with an upward trend, while subsystems showed clear differences. (2) CCD’s geographical distribution exhibited a clustering feature, with high value concentrating downstream and low value concentrating upstream. (3) Evolutionary trends illustrated the differences in basin location and resource dependency. (4) Population density, green innovation level, and openness were the dominant driving factors of the PREE system. Relevant policies were proposed to manage and coordinate the human-nature relationship. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating land use functions and heavy metal contamination to classify village types,"Identifying the dynamic processes of socio-economic development and environmental sustainability is an important measure to prevent environmental degradation and improve human well-being in village areas. However, there is currently a lack of analytical frameworks that integrate socio-economic and environmental security indicators in village areas, making it difficult to accurately identify the ecological environmental status of village areas at different stages of development. This study quantified the multifunctional land use and heavy metal pollution risks of different village areas using land use data and soil samples collected in the field. It then integrated land use functions and heavy metal pollution risks into the analytical framework using hierarchical clustering, which identified different types of village areas. The results show that: (1) The applicability and accuracy of this analytical framework are validated by a sample verification, which classifies village areas into traditional village, productive village, comprehensive village and ecotype village. (2) Most village areas belong to the traditional village with single production and life functions. With the development of village industries, some traditional villages become productive villages. Those closer to cities or with policy support continue to develop into comprehensive villages. In this process, the village socio-economy develops, land use functional services become more diverse, but heavy metal risks gradually increase. (3) Traditional villages should prevent pollution risks from Cd, Zn and other heavy metals. Productive villages should prevent Cu, Ni, Zn, Cr and other heavy metals from industrial and domestic wastewater. Comprehensive villages should strengthen soil remediation and remediation of heavy metal contaminated sites, adjust industrial layout. Ecotype villages should avoid the impact of exogenous pollutants on the region and develop ecotourism industries. Through the classification results and discussion of village area types, this study effectively reveals the differences in environmental risks faced by socio-economic development in typical village areas in China, and provides a basis for governments to formulate functional planning and environmental protection policies suitable for different types of villages. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of technological progress on China’s haze pollution—based on decomposition and rebound research,"In order to effectively analyze and explore the socio-economic impact of haze pollution, the article constructs a comprehensive two-stage decomposition model to verify that technological progress plays a key role in controlling haze pollution. And for the first time, a macro-level research framework for the rebound effect of haze pollution has been constructed to compare and analyze the heterogeneity of the rebound effect of technological progress in different industries in different regions. The study found that (1) during the period 2000–2017, haze pollution situation deteriorated. Economic effects were the main reasons for haze pollution. Among these effects, technological progress was the main driving force for haze control, followed by the emission intensity during 2000–2011 and the reduction of industrial structure since 2014. (2) The significant drive of emission reduction is in the secondary industry, showing a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. Besides, there was a difference in spatial distribution, which shows an increased trend from east to west. (3) The rebound effect of haze pollution at the macro level in China presented high-level fluctuations, and there were certain spatial distribution differences. However, due to the convergence of technological development stages, regional differences have a gradual convergence trend. In the future, in the process of haze control, it is necessary to increase support for technological innovation, implement energy total control and price reform, promote technological progress, and implement differentiated haze reduction policies to solve problems according to local conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Empowering local governments: How environmental fiscal federalism affects greenhouse gas emissions in China?,"Fiscal decentralization holds promise in addressing inherent challenges such as incentive deficiencies and information asymmetry in command-and-control environmental regulations. However, its effectiveness in mitigating climate change remains unclear. This study examines the impacts of environmental fiscal federalism on greenhouse gas emissions by applying a high-dimensional fixed-effects panel model to a multi-source panel dataset from 2006 to 2017 for 1757 counties in China. The findings show that environmental federalism significantly reduces local carbon emission intensity. Specifically, for a 1% increase in environmental decentralization, the average carbon emission intensity will drop by 0.35%. This effect is more pronounced in China's central and western regions as well as in areas with higher emissions. In addition, this decentralization process yields air pollution mitigation co-benefits. The results of channel tests further demonstrate that economic decentralization and industrial structural integration enhance the emission reduction effects of environmental decentralization. Finally, this study discovers that implementing cap-and-trade mechanisms strengthens the emission reduction effects of environmental decentralization, with theoretical analysis provided on how both mechanisms can achieve optimal outcomes. These findings offer valuable practical and policy implications for achieving carbon emission reduction goals in emerging and transitioning economies. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Challenges of typical inter-basin water transfer projects in China: Anticipated impacts of climate change on streamflow and hydrological drought under CMIP6,"Inter-basin water transfer projects are critical for economic development in water scarcity regions. However, the streamflow reduction and the frequent dry extremes in a warming environment raise significant concerns regarding the sustainability of such projects. Based on the latest CMIP6 data, hydrological model, Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI), and run theory, this study systemically examined the future streamflow and hydrological drought changes in the Hanjiang to Weihe River Water Diversion Project (HWWDP) area, China. Significantly, as the most challenging project management scenario, the response of spatially compound hydrological drought (i.e., concurrent hydrological drought in both the water intake and receiving area) was further revealed. This analysis offers the potential to yield novel insights into the prospective management strategies for the HWWDP. The investigation covers the baseline period (1971–2014) and future periods (2021–2100) under SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios. The outcomes demonstrate a decline in annual average streamflow of 5.0–6.4 (SSP245) hundred million cubic meters in the water receiving area and 4.6–7.5 (SSP245) and 3.4–8.1 (SSP585) hundred million cubic meters in the water intake area, respectively, compared to the baseline period. Furthermore, hydrological drought frequency may increase in both the water receiving and source areas, particularly in the summer under SSP585. The duration, severity, and peak intensity of hydrological drought events in the receiving area are expected to exacerbate due to climate change, while those impacts on water intake area should be relatively minor. The spatially compound hydrological drought is expected to occur more frequently in different months except April. The conditional probabilities of spatially compound hydrological drought occurrence may rise by 5.2%-18.7% (SSP245) and 5.9%-20.4% (SSP585) in different months when drought occurs in the water intake area. Moreover, higher probabilities are expected to be observed from April to October when the water receiving area experiences drought. These findings underscore the necessity for adaptive climate change management of the HWWDP to address the future reduction in streamflow and more severe hydrological drought. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate policy integration on energy transition: An analysis on Chinese cases at the local scale,"International concerns about climate change and environmental and socio-economic impacts linked to fossil fuels have pushed energy transition up the agenda of the Chinese central government. The Chinese central government recognises that energy transition requires actions beyond what the energy sector can deliver, and has thus called for policy integration. Climate policy integration has emerged as one of the key strategies to respond to energy concerns by incorporating the diverse perspectives of various sectors. The main goal is for energy issues be considered and governed by multiple sectors taking collective responsibility and allocating resources for similar policy ambitions. However, developing integrated policy within traditional hierarchical sectoral settings can be rather challenging. In this article, we analyse how the integration of energy ambitions within non-energy sectors manifests at local level in urban China. This research draws upon semi-structured interviews in two case study cities: Chengdu and Yangzhou. We find generally weak climate policy integration in local governments due to insufficient communication and interaction between policy sectors, limited professional capacity, and inefficient governance structures. These findings suggest incorporating hierarchical, top-down governance with an increase in cross-sectoral and horizontal forms of communication and interaction, as both actions can significantly facilitate policy integration. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Accelerating the Improvement of Human Well-Being in China through Economic Growth and Policy Adjustment,"Human well-being in many countries lags behind the gross domestic product (GDP) due to the rapid changes in the socio-economic environment that have occurred for decades. However, the mechanisms behind this complex phenomenon are still unclear. This study revealed the changes in human well-being in China from 1995 to 2017 by revising the genuine progress indicator (GPI) at the national level and further quantified the contribution of interfering factors that have driven the increase in the GPI. The results indicated that: (1) The per capita GPI of China showed an increasing trend with an annual growth rate of 12.43%. The changes in the GPI followed the same pattern as economic development, rather than presenting the phenomenon of economic growth combined with a decline in welfare that has been recorded in some countries and regions. (2) The increase in human well-being was mainly driven by economic growth, but it was most sensitive to social factors. (3) Increasing income inequality and the cost of lost leisure time contributed obvious negative impacts (24.69% and 23.35%, respectively) to the per capita GPI. However, the increase in personal consumption expenditures, the value of domestic labor, ecosystem service value, and net capital growth accelerated the rise in the GPI, with positive contribution rates of 30.69%, 23%, 20.54%, and 20.02%, respectively. (4) The continuous increase in economic investment and the strengthening of social management due to policy adjustments completely counteracted the negative impacts on human well-being, thus leading to a great increase in the per capita GPI. Such insights could provide theoretical support for decision making and policy implementation to improve global human well-being. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Toxic Metals in Particulate Matter and Health Risks in an E-Waste Dismantling Park and Its Surrounding Areas: Analysis of Three PM Size Groups,"Heavy metals generated from e-waste have created serious health risks for residents in e-waste disposal areas. This study assessed how airborne toxic metals from an e-waste dismantling park (EP) influenced surrounding residential areas after e-waste control. PM2.5, PM10, and total suspended particles (TSP) were sampled from 20 sites, including an EP, residential areas, and an urban site; ten kinds of metals were analyzed using ICP-MS and classified as PM2.5, PM2.5–10, and PM10–100. Results showed that metals at the EP tended to be in coarser particles, while metals from residential areas tended to be in finer particles. A source analysis showed that metals from the EP and residential areas may have different sources. Workers’ cancer and non-cancer risks were higher when exposed to PM2.5–10 metals, while residents’ risks were higher when exposed to PM2.5 metals. As and Cr were the most strongly associated with cancer risks, while Mn was the most strongly associated with the non-cancer risk. Both workers and residents had cancer risks (>1.0 × 10−6), but risks were lower for residents. Therefore, e-waste control can positively affect public health in this area. This study provides a basis for further controlling heavy metal emissions into the atmosphere by e-waste dismantling and encouraging worldwide standardization of e-waste dismantling. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamic adjustment model of the water rights trading price based on water resource scarcity value analysis,"The formation of the water rights trading price is an important part of the water rights trading system. In order to continuously and dynamically reflect the social–economic development changes and water resource scarcity, herein, we discuss the dynamic adjustment of the water rights trading price from the perspective of water resource scarcity value analysis. First, we constructed the water resource scarcity evaluation index system from the four dimensions of the water resource natural endowment, the water resource supply, the water resource demand, and the water environ-ment, and then we constructed the water resource scarcity index calculation model of the transferor, the transferee, and the comprehensive water resource scarcity index calculation model of both par-ties of the trading. Second, by analyzing the 30 comparable water rights trading cases in China since 2016, we established the response function of the water rights trading price to the water resource scarcity index, and then we analyzed the impact mechanism of the water resource scarcity index on the water rights trading price. Third, based on the two factors of “the water resource scarcity value” and “the capital time value,” we constructed a dynamic price adjustment model of water rights trading for different adjustment factors, so as to adjust the water rights trading price scientifically. Finally, we took the water rights trading in Helan County (Helan) of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Ningxia) as an example. The research shows that: (1) During the trading period of water rights in Helan, the water resource scarcity index rises, and the water rights trading price should be increased year-by-year. Additionally, there are certain differences in the water rights trading price changes with the adjustment of different elements. Among them, considering the adjustment of “the water resource scarcity value” element, the water rights trading price of Helan should be increased from 1.0940 to 2.8574 CNY/m³ during the water rights trading period; (2) there are differences in the water rights trading cost under different payment modes, among which the annual payment mode increased the most, i.e., from 2.7350 × 108 to 7.4500 × 108 CNY. This study suggests exerting a regu-lating effect of the water scarcity value on the water rights trading price, so as to promote the con-struction of a more equitable and long-term water rights trading market. © 2021 by the authors.

Assessment of water footprints of consumption and production in transboundary river basins at country-basin mesh-based spatial resolution,"Water is unevenly distributed globally. This uneven distribution is the reason behind the differences among geographical areas in terms of their water footprint of consumption and production. This gives the global trade of goods a unique feature. This characteristic of the water footprint might be used to address water scarcity and conflicts because water availability also has the same trend. Transboundary river basins are freshwater resources with a high probability of water scarcity and conflict because the water is claimed by multiple sovereign countries. In order to design sharing mechanisms for transboundary river basins that incorporate virtual water concept, it is key to identify the virtual water balance of country-basin units. A study addressing this research gap is not yet available. This article identified and discussed net virtual water importer and exporter sub-basins of transboundary rivers at a country-basin mesh based spatial resolution. The results of our study show that out of the 565 country-basin units surveyed in this article 391, 369, and 461 are net gray, green, and blue virtual water importers respectively. These sub-basins covers 58.37%, 47.52% and 57.52% of the total area covered by transboundary river basins and includes 0.65, 1.9, and around 2 billion people, respectively. The results depict that not only the water endowment of sub-basins is a determining factor for their water footprint of consumption and production, but also their social, economic, and demographic profiles. Furthermore, the water footprint of consumption and production within most of the country-basin units have a global feature. Hence, sustainable water management schemes within border-crossing basins should take into account not only the local but also the global water footprints of consumption and production. This can offer more options for sharing transboundary river basins water capital, thereby minimizing the probability of water scarcity and water conflicts. © 2019 by the authors.

Climate Change and Human Health in Africa in Relation to Opportunities to Strengthen Mitigating Potential and Adaptive Capacity: Strategies to Inform an African “Brains Trust”,"Background: Africa faces diverse and complex population/human health challenges due to climate change. Understanding the health impacts of climate change in Africa in all its complexity is essential for implementing effective strategies and policies to mitigate risks and protect vulnerable populations. This study aimed to outline the major climate change-related health impacts in Africa in the context of economic resilience and to seek solutions and provide strategies to prevent or reduce adverse effects of climate change on human health and well-being in Africa. Methods: For this narrative review, a literature search was conducted in the Web of Science, Scopus, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved articles for additional records as well as reports. We followed a conceptual framework to ensure all aspects of climate change and health impacts in Africa were identified. Results: The average temperatures in all six eco-regions of Africa have risen since the early twentieth century, and heat exposure, extreme events, and sea level rise are projected to disproportionately affect Africa, resulting in a larger burden of health impacts than other continents. Given that climate change already poses substantial challenges to African health and well-being, this will necessitate significant effort, financial investment, and dedication to climate change mitigation and adaptation. This review offers African leaders and decision-makers data-driven and action-oriented strategies that will ensure a more resilient healthcare system and safe, healthy populations—in ways that contribute to economic resiliency. Conclusions: The urgency of climate-health action integrated with sustainable development in Africa cannot be overstated, given the multiple economic gains from reducing current impacts and projected risks of climate change on the continent’s population health and well-being. Climate action must be integrated into Africa’s development plan to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, protect vulnerable populations from the detrimental effects of climate change, and promote economic development. © 2024 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Land restoration in food security programmes: synergies with climate change mitigation,"Food-insecure households in many countries depend on international aid to alleviate acute shocks and chronic shortages. Some food security programmes (including Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program–PSNP–which provides a case study for this article) have integrated aid in exchange for labour on public works to reduce long-term dependence by investing in the productive capacity and resilience of communities. Using this approach, Ethiopia has embarked upon an ambitious national programme of land restoration and sustainable land management. Although the intent was to reduce poverty, here we show that an unintended co-benefit is the climate-change mitigation from reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increased landscape carbon stocks. The article first shows that the total reduction in net GHG emissions from PSNP’s land management at the national scale is estimated at 3.4 million Mg CO2e y−1–approximately 1.5% of the emissions reductions in Ethiopia’s Nationally Determined Contribution for the Paris Agreement. The article then explores some of the opportunities and constraints to scaling up of this impact. Key policy insights Food security programmes (FSPs) can contribute to climate change mitigation by creating a vehicle for investment in land and ecosystem restoration. Maximizing mitigation, while enhancing but not compromising food security, requires that climate projections, and mitigation and adaptation responses should be mainstreamed into planning and implementation of FSPs at all levels. Cross-cutting oversight is required to integrate land restoration, climate policy, food security and disaster risk management into a coherent policy framework. Institutional barriers to optimal implementation should be addressed, such as incentive mechanisms that reward effort rather than results, and lack of centralized monitoring and evaluation of impacts on the physical environment. Project implementation can often be improved by adopting best management practices, such as using productive living livestock barriers where possible, and increasing the integration of agroforestry and non-timber forest products into landscape regeneration. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Investigating the optimal location of potential forest industry clusters to enhance domestic timber utilization in South Korea,"South Korea has abundant forest resources capable of supplying the domestic wood demand. Despite the extensive forest resources, there is continued uncertainty about the nature, quantity, and quality of the timber contained in any particular forested area. Additionally, some technical, logistic, and economic challenges act as barriers to the expansion of domestic timber utilization. To overcome these limitations and to enhance the domestic timber utilization in South Korea, this study investigated the optimal location of potential forest industry clusters. The potential forest availability was estimated based on localized allometric equations. The integration of the analytical hierarchy process and GIS modeling, including a supply chain that minimizes transportation costs, allowed the identification of optimal forest industry clusters locations that balanced the economic, environmental, and social dimensions within the forest industry supply chain. The study reveals that the estimated potential forest resources availability presented approximately 1 billion m3, including sawlog (474 million m3) and pulpwood grade (541 million m3). Additionally, 45 percent of the sawlogs and 48 percent of the pup grade wood were produced from the Gangwon and Gyeongsangbuk-do regions. Furthermore, the logistic analysis indicates that ten potential forest industry clusters are best aligned with the optimal socio-economic impacts with minimized timber transportation costs. To identify the optimal size and number of potential forest industry clusters, further studies that consider fixed and variable costs for maintaining the forest industry clusters are required. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Evidence and implications of recent and projected climate change in Alaska's forest ecosystems,"The structure and function of Alaska's forests have changed significantly in response to a changing climate, including alterations in species composition and climate feedbacks (e.g., carbon, radiation budgets) that have important regional societal consequences and human feedbacks to forest ecosystems. In this paper we present the first comprehensive synthesis of climate-change impacts on all forested ecosystems of Alaska, highlighting changes in the most critical biophysical factors of each region. We developed a conceptual framework describing climate drivers, biophysical factors and types of change to illustrate how the biophysical and social subsystems of Alaskan forests interact and respond directly and indirectly to a changing climate.We then identify the regional and global implications to the climate system and associated socio-economic impacts, as presented in the current literature. Projections of temperature and precipitation suggest wildfire will continue to be the dominant biophysical factor in the Interior-boreal forest, leading to shifts from conifer- to deciduous-dominated forests. Based on existing research, projected increases in temperature in the Southcentral- and Kenai-boreal forests will likely increase the frequency and severity of insect outbreaks and associated wildfires, and increase the probability of establishment by invasive plant species. In the Coastal-temperate forest region snow and ice is regarded as the dominant biophysical factor. With continued warming, hydrologic changes related to more rapidly melting glaciers and rising elevation of the winter snowline will alter discharge in many rivers, which will have important consequences for terrestrial and marine ecosystem productivity. These climate-related changes will affect plant species distribution and wildlife habitat, which have regional societal consequences, and trace-gas emissions and radiation budgets, which are globally important. Our conceptual framework facilitates assessment of current and future consequences of a changing climate, emphasizes regional differences in biophysical factors, and points to linkages that may exist but that currently lack supporting research. The framework also serves as a visual tool for resource managers and policy makers to develop regional and global management strategies and to inform policies related to climate mitigation and adaptation. © 2011 Wolken et al.",Not About Sufficiency
"Contextualizing local landscape initiatives in global change: a scenario study for the high forest zone, Ghana","Integrated landscape management (ILM) has received increased interest to reconcile multiple conflicting demands on a landscape scale. ILM aims at addressing major interconnected global challenges, such as poverty, food security, deforestation, and climate change. A principal element of ILM is the consideration of multiple scales, harmonizing local-level needs and ambitions with those that derive from outside the landscape. ILM initiatives are most often initiated by local actors focusing on local priorities, thereby insufficiently realizing that the landscape is embedded in a wider macroeconomic and societal context. We contextualize a landscape initiative located in the high forest zone of southern Ghana, focusing on global socioeconomic and political developments that are expected to have an influence on the region. We built two “sustainability” scenarios for the period between 2015 and 2030, reflecting the demands and ambitions of local stakeholders (bottom-up) and of global environmental policy (top-down) for the region. We find that global climate and cocoa production priorities could induce synergies between food production, biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation at the scale of the case study region but could come at the cost of mixed forest systems that play an important role in livelihoods on the landscape scale. Land change scenarios can play a critical role in assessing and visualizing such interactions and provide a platform for discussion and negotiation on how to integrate different objectives in the design of landscape initiatives. © 2020, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Income distribution and CO2 emission: A comparative analysis for China and India,"The aim of this paper is to test whether income inequality contributes to environmental degradation in China and India, where both countries are giving a great concern about the implications of their unsustainable energy consumption to the environment not only to themselves but also to the global environmental sustainability. By applying the bounds test approach to cointegration we found in both countries a long-run but not a statistically significant relationship between income inequality and CO2 emissions both in the long-run and in the short-run. The robustness of our cointegration results is also ascertained by using three different long-run tests. Furthermore, applying the variance decomposition analysis to examine the dynamic causal relationship between the Gini coefficient of income distribution and CO2 emissions, we found that income inequality was the least important factor in determining CO2 emissions and that there was no causality running in any direction between CO2 emissions and income inequality in both countries. Still income and energy consumption are the major determinants of CO2 emissions in both countries. Nevertheless, even though the evidence is not statistically significant, in the case of China it indicates that reducing income inequality can have a positive impact on environmental quality, while in India redistributing income to improve environmental degradation may not be effective. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Integrated ocean management for a sustainable ocean economy,"The rapidly evolving ocean economy, driven by human needs for food, energy, transportation and recreation, has led to unprecedented pressures on the ocean that are further amplified by climate change, loss of biodiversity and pollution. The need for better governance of human activities in the ocean space has been widely recognized for years, and is now also incorporated in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Even so, many challenges relating to the implementation of existing governance frameworks exist. Here, we argue that integrated ocean management (IOM) should be the key overarching approach—building upon and connecting existing sectoral governance efforts—for achieving a sustainable ocean economy. IOM is a holistic, ecosystem-based and knowledge-based approach that aims to ensure the sustainability and resilience of marine ecosystems while integrating and balancing different ocean uses to optimize the overall ocean economy. We discuss examples of IOM in practice from areas where preconditions differ substantially, and identify six universal opportunities for action that can help achieve a sustainable ocean economy. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",Not About Sufficiency

Sustainable community development: Integrating social and environmental sustainability for sustainable housing and communities,"The concepts of sustainable development (SD) and sustainable communities (SCs) are firmly on policy agendas. Conceptual clarity is essential for the selection of high-quality indicators to monitor progress in these areas. However, there are very mixed views about the nature of social sustainability (SS), and SC is rarely defined. Definitions that exist are extremely limited. This paper addresses these deficiencies by presenting a new definition and conceptualisation of SC in which addressing both social and environmental needs is critical. SS is clearly defined as addressing basic human needs, so that the criterion of sufficiency is met. Ensuring ‘sufficiency’ is crucial to ensure the provision of welfare within planetary boundaries, firmly integrating the social and environmental in conceptualising and operationalising SS. Using the new SC framework, the paper illustrates how regeneration programmes targeting housing could simultaneously address many social and environmental problems contributing to more progress on many dimensions of SD and the UN SD goals (UNSDGs). © 2021 The Author.

Food security during nuclear winter: a preliminary agricultural sector analysis for Aotearoa New Zealand,"Aim: We aimed to estimate the current dietary energy content of food exports for Aotearoa New Zealand and food security during “nuclear winter” scenarios following a nuclear war. methods: From published sources we estimated dietary energy available from the major domains of food exports, with adjustments for wastage. The impacts on food production in New Zealand during three nuclear winter scenarios were based on those published in Nature Food in 2022 and from an earlier New Zealand Planning Council study. results: Current major food exports are equivalent to 3.9 times current dietary energy intakes for all New Zealand citizens i.e., 34,100 kJ (8150 kcal) per person per day. Exported dairy products were estimated to be able to provide 338% of this energy intake, followed by exports of meat (34%), fruit (8.6%), alcohol (4.8%), marine products (4.6%) and vegetables (2.7%). During the various nuclear winter scenarios considered (minimal to severe), food production available from diverted exported foods was estimated to still be 3.6 to 1.5 times current daily energy intakes. Nevertheless, the agriculture sector could be at risk of various levels of collapse from lack of imports (e.g., diesel, fertiliser, pesticides, seeds, and machinery parts) and from socio-economic collapse, including if the financial system collapsed. conclusions: This analysis suggests that this country could theoretically have excess food production capacity, even after a severe nuclear winter scenario. But this benefit could be very short-term if the agricultural system was not made more resilient to potential lack of international trade and socio-economic collapse in a post-catastrophe setting. © 2023, Pasifika Medical Association Group.

First World,"The First World was originally identified in relation to the Second and Third Worlds in the 1950s and had a political basis. Over time, the concept has taken on other meanings, most notably to do with levels of economic development and progress. The concept continues to be used despite the disappearance of the Second World with the collapse of the communist bloc. It is now used to refer to countries with high levels of national income per capita and high living standards. The number of countries which fall into this category is increasing depending on the criteria used and the countries have diverse forms of political system, as well as different economic structures. There are also disparities within the countries; the population is not all at First World status. Finally, assumptions that First World countries have the power to shape global economic and political processes are being challenged in some settings. This article outlines the shifting definitions and membership of the First World and how changing global power relations are not only challenging the membership of this grouping, but also the nature of development or modernity that the term often implied. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Desalination in the 21st Century: A Critical Review of Trends and Debates,"Desalination - or the creation of ‘new’ water by removing salt and impurities from saline, brackish or contaminated water - has transformed water resource management in many parts of the world. This technology is likely to continue to reshape the practices, politics and political economy of water throughout the 21st century. Desalination has long been a focus of research in techno-managerial and techno-triumphalist circles, but as global capacity has grown and as new water infrastructures have developed in more diverse and contested contexts, it has increasingly attracted debate in the critical social sciences and humanities. This paper offers a critical review of the current state of the desalination debate. The paper proceeds in three parts. First, it sketches out the contours of desalination's uneven global emergence as a game changer in water resource management, briefly introducing the reader to its technical aspects and highlighting key trends. Second, the paper examines differing interpretations of the drivers of this phenomenon. The paper challenges dominant and reductionist explanations that tend to highlight water scarcity as an external factor, population growth and industrialisation. Instead, it foregrounds four alternative explanations for the extraordinary growth of desalination as: 1) a tool for fixing insoluble political issues in water management; 2) a technological adaptation that reflects and reinforces processes of decentralisation in water management; 3) a source of reliable long-term revenue for increasingly financialised models of water service provision; and 4) a driver of growth in particular industries and economic sectors. Finally, the paper suggests some future directions for critical desalination research. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Volta River Basin: Water for Food, Economic Growth and Environment","The Volta River Basin (VRB) is an important transboundary basin in West Africa that covers approximately 410,000 square kilometres across six countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Mali and Togo. Its natural resources sustain the livelihoods of its population and contribute to economic development. This book provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary review and assessment of the issues and challenges faced. The authors provide a science-based assessment of current and future scenarios of water availability, the demands of key sectors, including agriculture and hydropower, and the environment under changing demographic, economic, social and climatic conditions. They also identify solutions and strategies that will allow available water resources to be sustainably used to improve agricultural productivity, food security and economic growth in the VRB. Overall, the work examines from a multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder perspective the solutions and strategies to improve the use of water and other natural resources in the VRB to achieve enhanced food security, livelihoods and economic growth. © 2016 International Water Management Institute.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change & health: the case for sustainable development.,"The Earth's climate has been stable for around 10,000 years, though it has been very variable in earlier periods and has occasionally changed abruptly through natural processes. Industrialization and population growth have brought an exponential rise in the use of carbonaceous fuels, which is now having an observable impact on the composition of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide levels are already substantially above pre-industrial levels, and rising appreciably year on year. Climate models suggest that the anthropogenic rise in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will lead to rapid climate change over the twenty-first century, with an increase in global average temperatures in the region of two to five degrees Celsius. This will present problems of adaptation for many natural systems and have largely negative effects on human health through both direct and indirect mechanisms. There is also a possibility of unpredicted catastrophic impacts arising from non-linear effects of climate change, which may have more damaging effects on human and other populations. Policy responses have to be directed towards both adaptation needs and mitigation. Mitigation in particular presents formidable social, political and technological challenges, but it may bring net health benefits in the short as well as the longer term.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental and social footprints of international trade,"Globalization has led to an increasing geospatial separation of production and consumption, and, as a consequence, to an unprecedented displacement of environmental and social impacts through international trade. A large proportion of total global impacts can be associated with trade, and the trend is rising. Advances in global multi-region input-output models have allowed researchers to draw detailed, international supply-chain connections between harmful production in social and environmental hotspots and affluent consumption in global centres of wealth. The general direction of impact displacement is from developed to developing countries - an increase of health impacts in China from air pollution linked to export production for the United States being one prominent example. The relocation of production across countries counteracts national mitigation policies and may negate ostensible achievements in decoupling impacts from economic growth. A comprehensive implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals therefore requires the inclusion of footprint indicators to avoid loopholes in national sustainability assessments. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Climate change impacts on agriculture in 2050 under a range of plausible socioeconomic and emissions scenarios,"Previous studies have combined climate, crop and economic models to examine the impact of climate change on agricultural production and food security, but results have varied widely due to differences in models, scenarios and input data. Recent work has examined (and narrowed) these differences through systematic model intercomparison using a high-emissions pathway to highlight the differences. This paper extends that analysis to explore a range of plausible socioeconomic scenarios and emission pathways. Results from multiple climate and economic models are combined to examine the global and regional impacts of climate change on agricultural yields, area, production, consumption, prices and trade for coarse grains, rice, wheat, oilseeds and sugar crops to 2050. We find that climate impacts on global average yields, area, production and consumption are similar across shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP 1, 2 and 3, as we implement them based on population, income and productivity drivers), except when changes in trade policies are included. Impacts on trade and prices are higher for SSP 3 than SSP 2, and higher for SSP 2 than for SSP 1. Climate impacts for all variables are similar across low to moderate emissions pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0), but increase for a higher emissions pathway (RCP 8.5). It is important to note that these global averages may hide regional variations. Projected reductions in agricultural yields due to climate change by 2050 are larger for some crops than those estimated for the past half century, but smaller than projected increases to 2050 due to rising demand and intrinsic productivity growth. Results illustrate the sensitivity of climate change impacts to differences in socioeconomic and emissions pathways. Yield impacts increase at high emissions levels and vary with changes in population, income and technology, but are reduced in all cases by endogenous changes in prices and other variables. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"The visual opportunity spaces of oil: in promotion, protest, and warning","This essay illustrates how petroleum, the oil industry, and oil corporations manifest and are manifested across publicly visible and accessible platforms, or visual opportunity spaces, in promotion, conflict, consumption, and warning. The product, industry operations, and brand name corporations are represented as essential entities, benevolent neighbours, educators, or entertainment providers; as problematic or disruptive; or as hazardous. Yet when comparing everyday observations, corporate-sponsored images of goodwill are not equally countered by images of resistance or government-mandated public health warnings. Positive images blanket public opportunity spaces in ways that lead to the normalisation of the industry’s presence and of the consumption and production of petroleum, while critical or cautious visual narratives are minimised to sporadic or event-based protest activities or minuscule and routinised warnings. A comparative analysis sheds light on the imbalance of visual indicators of promotion, criticism, and vigilance. Oil corporations or the industry dominate and are permitted to dominate access to visual spaces in volume, duration, and positive or gratifying sensations that are not equally countered by civil society’s challenges or concerns, or by notices of climate change or human or ecological health risks. © 2020 International Visual Sociology Association.",Not About Sufficiency
"Volumetric water footprints, applied in a global context, do not provide insight regarding water scarcity or water quality degradation","Many authors have presented estimates of volumetric water footprints in the context of describing and comparing the water requirements of crop production and industrial activities. In recent years, water footprints have been proposed as indicators for use in assessing the sustainability, efficiency, and equity of water allocations in a global context. That perspective is notably ambitious, given that volumetric water footprints contain information pertaining to just one resource, with no consideration of scarcity values, opportunity costs, or the impacts of water use on the environment, livelihoods, or human health. The suggestion that water scarcity must be assessed from a global perspective also is misplaced. Water scarcity and water quality degradation arise in local and regional settings. The impacts and potential remedies must be evaluated at those levels, by scientists and public officials charged with determining the policies and investments needed to ensure wise use of water resources. Efforts to extend access to clean, safe, and affordable water to the millions of households lacking such access also must be designed and implemented locally. Public officials will not gain useful insight by comparing volumetric water footprints in a global context. Water scarcity and water quality degradation cannot be resolved by reorganizing production activities across river basins and continents. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
REGRETTABLE SILENCES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION,"This article suggests that regrettable silences in development education (DE) on key issues of social justice and sustainability largely result from four unresolved issues. First, there is ongoing conflation of different meanings of ‘development’, but the most common meaning of development conflicts with development toward critical consciousness, greater justice, and sustainability. Second, the dominant form of human development usually involves exploitation of other people, species, and ecosystems, and this may elicit uncomfortable cognitive dissonance for development educators. Third, DE is not well-grounded in the Earth’s biophysical limits or in what those limits imply for the directions future development must take. Specifically, modern civilisation is a self-terminating system that must be replaced. Fourth, much of DE is linked to the United Nations’ (UN) 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which steer us away from sustainability and do not resolve vast and toxic inequality. Given these issues, it is understandable that DE often appears to be stuck tinkering around the margins of an unhealthy, unfair, and unsustainable civilisation. By merging time-tested Indigenous worldviews with science regarding the Earth’s limits and the basic needs of life, future directions for development education are proposed to help humanity create a healthy, just, and sustainable civilisation. © 2024, Centre for Global Education.

"Studying the effectiveness of activated carbon R95 respirators in reducing the inhalation of combustion by-products in Hanoi, Vietnam: A demonstration study","Background: Urban air pollution is an increasing health problem, particularly in Asia, where the combustion of fossil fuels has increased rapidly as a result of industrialization and socio-economic development. The adverse health impacts of urban air pollution are well established, but less is known about effective intervention strategies. In this demonstration study we set out to establish methods to assess whether wearing an R95 activated carbon respirator could reduce intake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in street workers in Hanoi, Vietnam. Methods. In this demonstration study we performed a cross-over study in which non-smoking participants that worked at least 4 hours per day on the street in Hanoi were randomly allocated to specific respirator wearing sequences for a duration of 2 weeks. Urines were collected after each period, i.e. twice per week, at the end of the working day to measure hydroxy PAHs (OH-PAH) using gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry. The primary endpoint was the urinary concentration of 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP). Results: Forty-four participants (54.5% male, median age 40 years) were enrolled with the majority being motorbike taxi drivers (38.6%) or street vendors (34.1%). The baseline creatinine corrected urinary level for 1-OHP was much higher than other international comparisons: 1020 ng/g creatinine (IQR: 604-1551). Wearing a R95 mask had no significant effect on 1-OHP levels: estimated multiplicative effect 1.0 (95% CI: 0.92-1.09) or other OH-PAHs, except 1-hydroxynaphthalene (1-OHN): 0.86 (95% CI: 0.11-0.96). Conclusions: High levels of urine OH-PAHs were found in Hanoi street workers. No effect was seen on urine OH-PAH levels by wearing R95 particulate respirators in an area of high urban air pollution, except for 1-OHN. A lack of effect may be de to gaseous phase PAHs that were not filtered efficiently by the respirator. The high levels of urinary OH-PAHs found, urges for effective interventions. Trial registration.

"Human health, well-being and climate change in China","Cai Songwu works for the Guangdong Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, studying disease outbreaks. In the past, communication between Cai and other officials about outbreaks was slow, hampering their ability to anticipate and respond. Since 2005, districts and counties across the province have been able to connect to a real-time online monitoring system. ‘With real-time data, we are able to understand the breeding speed, growth and decline of vectors and pest density,’ he says. This kind of monitoring is becoming increasingly important as climate change alters the environmental conditions – temperatures, humidity, rainfall and carbon dioxide concentrations – that allow different kinds and numbers of pests to survive and thrive. ‘In the future, regions previously without vector organisms might become more suitable for vectors to breed, and this is likely to give rise to infectious diseases.’ The links between climate variability, seasons, human behaviour and health have been areas of concern for researchers and public health officials globally, as described by Cai Songwu; climate change must now be factored into health programmes. Shifts in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, increasing incidences of floods and droughts, and sea level rise are just some of the many examples of a visibly changing climate. Death, injuries and illness due to extreme weather and slow-onset events have unfolded at unprecedented scales in the turn of the millennium; these have finally begun to attract attention to the critical challenge the impacts climate change poses to human health (Field et al., 2014; Huang, C. et al., 2011; Parry et al., 2007). Vector-borne and zoonotic disease transmission rates are also likely to be altered by climate change and are being investigated by research organisations. The Fifth Assessment Report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states with very high confidence that the health of human populations is sensitive to shifts in weather patterns and other aspects of climate change.1 For example, in many parts of the world, including China, heat waves and other extreme temperature events have led to increased morbidity and mortality. Climate change, in conjunction with rapid urbanisation and development, is altering the distribution of infectious diseases. Climate shifts are contributing to livelihood losses and food insecurity due to reductions in agricultural productivity associated with floods, droughts and storms. These can in turn increase risk of malnutrition or illness from contaminated food and water (WHO, 2010; Kan et al., 2012). If the climatic changes continue as projected, the health of a large number of populations, particularly those who are poor and vulnerable, will be at risk and their existing problems will be exacerbated (Field et al., 2014). Current research suggests that climate change will primarily exacerbate existing health problems, although unanticipated health consequences cannot be excluded. Compared to sectors like agriculture, forestry, ecology and water resources, climate change related health impacts have received little attention from decision makers. The need for many countries to develop response strategies to protect health continues to go unnoticed. Until recently, health impacts were not assessed or well-quantified, nor have the findings been communicated effectively beyond the scientific community. This lack of information may have contributed to the perception in China that the burden of ill health from climate change is minimal and will continue to be so. There exists a gap in understandable information that clearly explains the potential health effects of climate change, as well as what can be done to reduce climate change-health risks. This chapter looks at the range and magnitude of climate change impacts on human health in China. The chapter opens with a brief overview of trends in climate change and health in China, drawing from an extensive literature review of the contemporary work of Chinese researchers. The chapter then presents a case study on Guangdong Province, drawing from two separate investigations conducted by the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Public Health (GD IPH) and the Guangdong Provincial Centre for Disease Control (GD CDC), with support from Griffith University (Australia). Guangdong is one of the most populated and urbanised provinces in China and has the largest GDP. Despite this, extreme regional imbalances in economic development, a large population of economic migrants and rural/urban disparities result in low per capita economic indicators. The province’s location on China’s south-eastern coast leaves it highly exposed to tropical cyclones, storm surges and tidal flooding, all of which will be exacerbated by sea level rise. Its climate is hot and humid, with an average annual temperature of 23°C – perfect conditions for vector-borne diseases. Further detailed information on Guangdong’s current and future vulnerability and climate risks beyond those posed to health are presented in Chapter 10. The combination of these factors makes the province of great research interest in terms of climate impacts on human health, and research and climate resilience activities and policies conducted within it can provide lessons to the rest of China. The chapter concludes with current policy responses in China at the national and provincial levels and outlines some of the existing challenges in building a response. © 2016 Rebecca Nadin, Sarah Opitz-Stapleton and Xu Yinlong.",Not About Sufficiency
"Study on the Coupling Effect of Agricultural Production, Road Construction, and Ecology: The Case for Cambodia","Agricultural development is a necessary component of national development efforts to fight food crises and promote poverty reduction in many developing countries. However, many developing countries have fallen into a stalemate between modernization and development—modernized areas are less capable of driving regional development despite their abundant land and rich population. Striking a balance between agricultural technology and environmental protection is a key feature of sustainable land development. Based on the social–ecological resilience theory, this study takes Cambodia as an example and aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation index system to measure the agricultural production, regional road construction, and agricultural eco-environment in Cambodia. The coupled coordination model and gray relation analysis model are utilized to explore the interaction between agriculture, roads, and the agricultural eco-environment. The results show that (1) Cambodia has road environmental risks, and there is a need for rural labor migration in areas with higher levels of economic development. (2) The main agricultural production areas are faced with the dilemma of lagging infrastructure development, such as roads, and a huge potential for agricultural development. (3) In the plains areas, the growing population has caused tension between food security, fertilizer abuse, and deforestation, which intensified the disturbance of the agricultural ecological environment. In summary, based on their own developmental needs, developing countries at different stages of development can explore the interaction between agricultural production, infrastructure development, and the agricultural eco-environment in the process of agricultural development. This study attempts to provide a set of practical development policy implications for developing countries that are seeking to enhance the coupling relationship between agricultural production, infrastructure, and the agricultural eco-environment. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability of ICT hardware procurement in Switzerland: A status-quo analysis of the public procurement sector,"Sustainable procurement requires organizations to align their purchasing behavior with regard to broader goals linked to resource efficiency, climate change, social responsibility and other sustainability criteria. The level of sustainability in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) hardware procurement is analyzed for two reasons: First, ICT hardware belongs to the six key product groups in sustainable procurement. Second, ICT in general is expected to be an important enabler for low-carbon economies, providing solutions to reduce Green-House Gas (GHG) emissions. While the advantages of sustainable procurement are obvious, certain barriers hinder the adoption in day-to-day procurement. This case study on ICT hardware discusses the three important barriers ""lack of clear definitions per product group"", ""missing market intelligence about sustainable products""and ""inflexible procedures and attitudes as barriers for innovative approaches""based on an in-depth analysis of sustainable procurement of ICT hardware by the public sector in Switzerland. To this end, tender data published on the national procurement platform simap.ch is screened for sustainability criteria using the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) nomenclature to identify relevant ICT projects. The results reveal to which extent such criteria as well as their determinants are currently included in public tenders. Using two different approaches, only a small number of tenders were found containing sustainability criteria of a wide range from basic to comprehensive. The overall performance of Swiss public procurement is benchmarked by comparing the identified sustainability criteria with available criteria from international key actors in sustainable procurement. Thus, this analysis provides novel insights on how public agencies today take sustainability into account when procuring ICT hardware. © 2020 Owner/Author.",Not About Sufficiency
International trade of global scarce water use in agriculture: Modeling on watershed level with monthly resolution,"Fresh water is a renewable yet limited natural resource. While abundant in some areas, fresh water is scarce in others where its consumption in agriculture leads to negative impacts on humanity, ecosystems and biodiversity. International trade in water intensive products can help to reduce water stress or may increase water consumption in water stressed regions. We attribute the share of global scarce water use by the agricultural production to individual countries and regions. We convert the volume of blue water use to cubic meters of scarce water equivalent by reflecting local and temporal water scarcity on a watershed and monthly level and allocate to final consumers, who pull the production chains. Our results indicate that international trade “helps” to limit water stress in arid regions, such as the Middle East region, Portugal and Mexico. However, the Middle East and Mexico still embody high scarce water use in exported products, which counter-acts stress mitigation. From the global perspective, the role of international trade in water stress mitigation is ambiguous as it enables humanity to thrive in inhospitable areas of the Middle East region; and consumption of products which are not available under domestic climatic conditions, e.g. cotton, sugar cane and rice. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Official environmental accountability policy and firm’s environmental violations: evidence from a quasi-natural experiment in China,"Whether administrative accountability can successfully reduce policy implementation deviations is crucial for the effective implementation of environmental regulations. This study investigates the effect of administrative accountability pilot policy on corporate environmental violations. Based on panel data of listed firms in highly polluting industries from 2012 to 2017, this paper adopts the difference-in-differences model to examine the effects. The results show that the official accountability policy significantly reduces corporate environmental violations in pilot cities compared to non-pilot cities. The study also shows that improving environmental enforcement is potential channel. Further analysis shows that the policy also helps to correct implementation deviations and improve the environmental transparency of subordinate governments. In addition, this paper finds that the official accountability policy performs better in areas with less pollution dependence and more environmental attention, and firms with a history of violations and state-owned enterprises are also more proactive. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Promoting inclusive water governance and forecasting the structure of water consumption based on compositional data: A case study of Beijing,"Water is centrally important for agricultural security, environment, people's livelihoods, and socio-economic development, particularly in the face of extreme climate changes. Due to water shortages in many cities, the conflicts between various stakeholders and sectors over water use and allocation are becoming more common and intense. Effective inclusive governance of water use is critical for relieving water use conflicts. In addition, reliable forecasting of the structure of water usage among different sectors is a basic need for effective water governance planning. Although a large number of studies have attempted to forecast water use, little is known about the forecasted structure and trends of water use in the future. This paper aims to develop a forecasting model for the structure of water usage based on compositional data. Compositional data analysis is an effective approach for investigating the internal structure of a system. A host of data transformation methods and forecasting models were adopted and compared in order to derive the best-performing model. According to mean absolute percent error for compositional data (CoMAPE), a hyperspherical-transformation-based vector autoregression model for compositional data (VAR-DRHT) is the best-performing model. The proportions of the agricultural, industrial, domestic and environmental water will be 6.11%, 5.01%, 37.48% and 51.4% by 2020. Several recommendations for water inclusive development are provided to give a better account for the optimization of the water use structure, alleviation of water shortages, and improving stake holders’ wellbeing. Overall, although we focus on groundwater, this study presents a powerful framework broadly applicable to resource management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Reimagining climate change research and policy from the Australian adaptation impasse,"Despite two decades of investment in climate change adaptation knowledge, planning and policy, the Australian policy and scientific community is now at an adaptation impasse, with effective, equitable and timely adaptation rare and negative impacts proliferating as a result. Drawing on Australia as an illustrative and globally relevant case study, we describe and diagnose the adaptation impasse using a novel four-part heuristic – Adaptation as Spectre, Signal, Social and Systems – to characterise adaptation knowledge and action and their evolution over time. We examine the relationship between these adaptation types and argue that an underlying political economy at odds with the demands of adapting to climate change is generating the adaptation impasse. We suggest that to overcome the impasse we need to transform adaptation into a science and practice that is imaginative, pluralist, and caring. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Method: Using open-ended assessments, we asked participants (n = 305) to identify their biggest challenge or concern (“top problem”), their most effective way of handling stress (“effective strategy”), and their most common way of handling stress (“common strategy”). We applied thematic analysis and evaluated whether participants’ strategies corresponded with evidence-based practices (EBPs). Results: Participants frequently reported top problems relating to productivity (27% of sample), physical health (26%), and emotional health (14%). Distraction was the most frequently classified common strategy (43%), whereas behavioral activation was the most frequently identified effective strategy (50%). Participants who reported a common strategy classified as an EBP reported lower depressive and anxiety symptoms. In contrast, there was no evidence of an association between symptom levels and whether or not participants’ effective strategy was an EBP. Participants who reported the same strategy as both their common and effective strategy (29%) reported lower depressive symptoms than those whose common and effective strategies were different. Conclusion: Our findings highlight stressors that students are experiencing and ways they are coping during the COVID-19 crisis. We discuss how these findings can inform mental health promotion efforts and future research on coping with stressors. © Copyright © 2021 Wasil, Franzen, Gillespie, Steinberg, Malhotra and DeRubeis.",Not About Sufficiency
Yield to the data: some perspective on crop productivity and pesticides,"The scientific consensus is that pesticide use maximizes crop yields in the face of pest and disease pressures. Often, the debate then becomes a “so what” question (e.g., a percent or two increase in yield is inconsequential, so why use pesticides at all?). We set out to help give technical and lay audiences an objective and quantitative sense of what it means for pesticides to protect crop yields from two perspectives: (i) the number of additional hectares required to produce the same amount of food without the use of pesticides; and (ii) increased calorie production and people fed. Using available seeding and yield data for Canada and United States from 2015 to 2019 for common field crops, a user-friendly interface was developed that allows for the coarse calculation of land preserved and caloric increases for specific scenarios (e.g., jurisdiction, crop, percent yield increase). We found that land preserved would range from 145 883 to 11 590 255 ha and the number of adults fed would range from 1 333 814 to 100 016 319 depending on the crop and the country. Our hope is that this simple tool will provide a fuller sense of what changes in crop yields mean, and their implications for environmental protection and food security. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",Not About Sufficiency
A political economy of hope: Materialisations of social class and inequity in women's imaginings of alcohol (free) futures,"This paper explores how social class shapes affective experiences, integrating the sociology of emotions with political economic theory to examine how systems of dis/advantage influence women's hopes and hopefulness about their futures and the potential for reductions in alcohol consumption. Using 149 open-ended qualitative interviews with 86 women across three studies, we analyse 'hope stories' to investigate how capacities for hopefulness are embedded in the social practices and temporal orientations of gender and class. Interviews focused on the role of alcohol in daily life and perceptions of opportunities for reducing consumption, particularly in the context of alcohol as a health risk. Throughout data analysis, we made sense of the data though literature on the sociology of hope and the political economy of hope, revealing how class and gender create differing conditions and expressions of hope. Women in affluent social class positions expressed confidence in reducing alcohol consumption (if desired), attributing this to agency and personal virtue, often dismissing the need for hope. Middle-class women reported relying on hope to navigate pressures to conform to gendered norms and respectability, where alcohol use is socially expected. In contrast, working-class women described feelings of hopelessness, as intersecting precarities in their lives reinforced reliance on alcohol to manage life stressors. This study highlights how social class and gender create varying distributions and conditions of hope, offering empirical evidence on the structuring structures of hopefulness. Our findings provide critical insights for policy makers to develop equitable and class-sensitive approaches to supporting women in reducing alcohol consumption. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of seasonal winter air pollution on health across the lifespan in Mongolia and some putative solutions,"Environmental pollution of the air, water, and soil comprise an increasingly urgent challenge to global health, well-being, and productivity. The impact of environmental pollution arguably has its greatest impact across the lifespan on children, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women and their unborn children, not only because of their vulnerability during development, but also because of their subsequent longevity. Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, is a highly instructive, perhaps extreme, example of what happens with recent, rapid urbanization. It is the coldest capital city on Earth, where average ambient temperatures routinely fall below 2408C/F between November and February. During the cold winter period, more than 200, 000 ""Gers"" (traditional felt-lined dwellings) in the ""Ger district"" burn over 600, 000 tons of coal for domestic heating (.3 tons each). Thus, outdoor ambient particulate levels frequently exceed 100 times the WHO-recommended safety level for sustained periods of time, and drive the majority of personal particulate matter exposure. Indoor levels of exposure are somewhat lower in this setting because Gers are equipped with chimneys. Major adverse health impacts that we have documented in the Ger districts include the following: respiratory diseases among those between 1 and 59 years of age and cardiac diseases in those over 60; alarming increases in lung cancer rates in females are also beginning to emerge; and fertility and subsequent successful completion of term pregnancy falls by up to half during the winter pollution season, while early fetal death rises by fourfold. However, the World Bank has intervened with a Ger stove replacement project that has progressively reduced winter pollution by about 30% over the past 5 years, and this has been accompanied by an increase in mean term birth weight of up to 100g. Each incremental decrement in air pollution clearly has beneficial effects on pregnancy, which are likely to have the greatest positive health and macroeconomic impact across the lifespan. However, innovative policies and solutions are clearly needed to eliminate coal heating in Gers and thus further reduce the markedly negative health impact of this practice. © 2018 by the American Thoracic Society.",Not About Sufficiency
Examining the Potential Impacts of Agro-Meteorology Initiatives for Climate Change Adaptation and Food Security in Bhutan,"Bhutan is a small Himalayan kingdom with 53.7% of the total population engaged in agriculture. The contribution of the agriculture sector to the overall GDP of the country is 17.37%. The country aims to achieve food security and bring agriculture transformation through sustainable and innovative technologies. As a fragile mountain ecosystem, the country is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and already facing the brunt of climate change such as increase in surface temperature, changing rainfall patterns and frequent occurrence of extreme weather events. The National Center for Hydrology and Meteorology which is the nodal agency for climate studies, project an increase in surface temperature and varying rainfall pattern under diverse climate change scenario. In light of changing climate, the food security challenges can further be aggravated through reduced crop yield and loss of crops to insect, pest and diseases and natural disasters such as droughts, erratic rainfall, windstorms, flash floods and landslides. Climate change adaptation is therefore, extremely important to enhance food security of the nation. An agro-met decision support system was developed to generate, disseminate advisories to make informed decisions under a changing climate and eventually increase the crop productivity. Meteorological information is also used to manage Smart irrigation system to increase water use efficiency and address farm labour shortage issues. The agrometeorology program also started weather-based pest foreting for sustainable crop protection. Implementation of numerous activities through the agro-met program of the department will moderate the potential impacts of climate change through provision of early warning information and preparation of contingency plans which contribute to overall enhancement of the food security of the country. © The Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries (NAM S&T Centre) 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis and techno-economic evaluation of co-pyrolysis of medical protective clothing and biomass,"With the increasing global energy demand and the worsening issue of energy shortages, the energy crisis has become a significant challenge worldwide. Meanwhile, the disposal of medical and agricultural waste is also becoming an increasingly critical issue. Medical waste, such as protective clothing, contains hazardous substances that, if improperly managed, pose threats to the environment and public health. Traditional disposal methods, such as incineration and landfilling, not only consume high amounts of energy but also make it difficult to recover energy and materials from the waste. To address these problems, this study proposes a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution, aiming to convert hazardous medical waste into valuable fuel products such as CH4, H2, and CO through pyrolysis technology. In this regard, the study conducted a series of simulation experiments to analyze the pyrolysis of medical protective clothing (MPC), cow dung (CD), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and corn straw (CS) under different temperature and mixing conditions. The results show that the pyrolysis of MPC alone predominantly produces char (accounting for around 50%). Co-pyrolysis of LDPE and MPC enhances the product yield. For example, at a pyrolysis temperature of 500 °C, co-pyrolysis of LDPE and MPC increases the methane (CH4) yield by 12% compared to the pyrolysis of MPC alone. Additionally, a life cycle assessment and a techno-economic evaluation were conducted from an application perspective. The results indicate that the project is economically feasible with net profits achievable in the second year of operation and has no harmful environmental impacts. Converting medical waste, agricultural waste, and other types of waste into biofuels holds the potential for being green, economical, and sustainable. This approach not only reduces reliance on traditional energy sources but also contributes to achieving carbon neutrality and promoting green development goals. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Spatially optimized allocation of water and land resources based on multi-dimensional coupling of water quantity, quality, efficiency, carbon, food, and ecology","The research on optimizing agricultural water and land resources is significant for improving resource utilization efficiency, ensuring food security, protecting the ecological environment, and promoting sustainable economic development. However, few studies have been conducted on the spatially optimized allocation of water and land resources based on the multidimensional coupling of water quantity, water quality, efficiency, carbon, ecology, and food. Therefore, this study establishes the Coupling Optimization Model of Water Resources and Landscape Structure (COM-WL). The objective is to optimize resource allocation within the irrigation area by comprehensively considering multiple factors. The COM-WL model integrates our improved genetic algorithm, PAEA-NSGAⅢ, with the landscape allocation model, GridLOpt. PAEA-NSGAⅢ builds upon the traditional NSGA-III algorithm, incorporating a progressive fitness adjustment strategy along with an elite preservation strategy. These enhancements enable the algorithm to explore the solution space more efficiently when addressing complex multi-objective problems to validate the effectiveness and practicality of the COM-WL model, we selected the Daan Irrigation District as the study area. Twenty-four scenarios, spanning four hydrological years, were designed for analysis. Each scenario focuses on six optimization objectives: increasing carbon sequestration, improving irrigation efficiency, enhancing ecological benefits, ensuring food production, reducing groundwater extraction, and controlling pollutant emissions. The GridLOpt model enables grid-based layout and spatial allocation of landscape structure in optimized scenarios, improving ecological connectivity and controlling the costs associated with landscape changes. The optimization results indicate that the irrigated area of rice increased by 0.04–6.08 %, while the irrigated area for corn decreased by 6.20–0.02 %, with the overall irrigated area remaining relatively stable. Additionally, emissions of agricultural pollutants decreased by 1.95 %, reaching 4.52 %. Meanwhile, carbon sequestration increased by 0.01 %, reaching 0.59 %. The efficiency of crop water resource utilization improved by 2.05 %, reaching 4.08 %. Ecological connectivity rose by 11.6 %, reaching 20.3 %. Furthermore, land-use conversion costs ranged from 58.82 million to 207.97 million yuan, consistent with the expected landscape structure. The model established in this study provides an approach to the multidimensional optimization of the coupling between water and land resources. © 2025",Not About Sufficiency
"Life cycle-based environmental, social, and economic assessment of waste printed circuit board management in isolated island areas: A case study in British Columbia, Canada","The rapid increase in the use of electronic equipment has led to a significant rise in waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs), which can pose severe environmental risks if not properly managed. This study evaluates the environmental, social, and economic performances of four WPCB management scenarios for island communities, using a comprehensive framework that combines Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). When constructing the scenarios, scenario 1 considered the mechanical separation of WPCBs with subsequent recycling of the metallic fractions and direct landfilling of the non-metallic fractions. In scenario 2, compared to scenario 1, the non-metallic fractions are incinerated before landfilling. Scenarios 3 and 4 involve the direct incineration and direct landfilling of the entire WPCBs, respectively. The results indicate that scenario 1 is the most favorable option. It yields the highest positive environmental (−4720 kg CO2 eq. per tonne of WPCBs) and social (−30,679 ELU per tonne of WPCBs) impact while remaining economically viable. In contrast, scenario 3 exhibits the most significant negative impacts across all subcategories, and one-tonne WPCBs can contribute 2750 kg CO2 eq. and 729 ELU in environmental and social perspectives in this case, respectively. The study emphasizes the importance of metal recovery processes in achieving sustainable WPCB management and provides critical insights for policymakers and waste management professionals in isolated island areas. This framework offers a robust tool for optimizing WPCB disposal systems, balancing the trade-offs between environmental sustainability, social impacts, and economic costs, and guiding future practices and policies in e-waste management. © 2025 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
The role of agricultural water trade in alleviating water scarcity: A case study of Northwest China,"Agricultural trade promotes the transfer of water resources, which has an impact on regional water scarcity, particularly in arid regions. Nevertheless, the understanding of how agricultural trade influences water scarcity and the populations under different water scarcity levels is still insufficient. This study examines the impact of domestic agricultural (food crop) trade on water scarcity in Northwest China by integrating a grid-based dynamic water balance model with a linear programming model. The results indicate that the agricultural blue water (surface and groundwater) footprint and green water (soil water) footprint in the Northwest region peaked in 2014, with the green water footprint being 17% higher than the blue water footprint. The increase in trade volume has effectively alleviated water scarcity in Northwest China, with green water playing a greater role than blue water, especially in Shaanxi and Ningxia. As trade volumes rise, the population facing mild water scarcity continues to grow after trade, with increases of 4.56%, 6.70%, and 5.36% in 2000, 2010 and 2014. Agricultural trade significantly alleviates the pressure of severe water scarcity and boosts the region's population carrying capacity. This study provides scientific evidence to support stronger coordination of water resources between regions, especially agricultural water trade between water-rich and water-scarce areas, and to inform the formulation of rational allocation policies for balancing regional water resource distribution and benefits. © 2025 Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, CAS",Not About Sufficiency
"Catalyzing sustainable development: Exploring the interplay between access to clean water, sanitation, renewable energy and electricity services in shaping China's energy, economic growth, and environmental landscape","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflect the shift in global economic conversation toward inclusive growth. The growth can promote inclusivity and widespread sharing of its advancements by concentrating on four key dimensions. (a) Equality of opportunity, (b) sharing prosperity, (3) environmental sustainability/climate adaptation, and (4) macroeconomic stability. We used the Kao cointegration test to study how certain variables are connected over a long period. The relationship between CO2 and GDP per capita, renewable energy and tourism, improved water and sanitation, and access to power all have a positive feedback effect on each other. Based on FMOLS's findings, a 1 % increase in Inclusive growth leads to a 0.342 % (Model 1) and 0.258 % (Model 3) increase in CO2 emissions. An increase of 1 percent in energy consumption per person resulted in a rise of 1.343 % in CO2 emissions in Case 1, 0.524 % in Case 2, and 0.618 % in Case 3. Increasing the tourism sector's proportion of total exports by just one percent will reduce CO2 emissions by 0.221 % (case 1) and 0.234 % (case 3).

Carbon and water relationships change nonlinearly along elevation gradient in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau,"The influence of terrain elevation on carbon and water ecosystem services, mediated by heat and energy redistribution, has significant implications for the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (QTP). Renowned as the “Third Pole of the Earth” and the “Water Tower of Asia,” the QTP boasts the planet's most extensive elevation range. However, understanding the intricate effects of the elevation gradient (EG) on carbon and water services and their interrelationships remains limited. In this study, we deploy the moving window method (MWM), the generalized additive model (GAM), and the structural equation model (SEM) to explain the dynamics of ecosystem service relationship across the EG. Our analysis, spanning 2000 to 2018, reveals annual mean values of carbon storage (CS) at 50.45 tC/ha and water yield (WY) at 246.14 mm for the QTP. The results highlight the importance of the carbon–water trade-off and the pronounced CS reduction in the south-central plateau under varying EG, alongside the harmonized interactions in the northeast and southern sectors. GAM outcomes show a non-linear association between ecosystem service relationship and EG. With elevational ascent, the correlation between the digital elevation model (DEM) and CS transitions from positive to negative, and the ecosystem service relationship transitions from synergy to trade-off. In the QTP, the explanatory force of inherent meteorological factors in shaping CS and WY surpasses that of all socio-economic factors, with the latter wielding greater influence over ecosystem service relationship dynamics. The insights from this investigation provide a foundation for integrating intricate terrain gradients into strategies aimed at alleviating potential adverse ramifications for human well-being. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis of water consumption characteristics and quota of the university in Beijing,"Water scarcity significantly threatens global water security, so a water quota must be established based on scientific evidence to improve water utilization. Colleges and universities have a large student population and consume large quantities of water. This study was conducted at a university in Beijing as the research object. The water consumption of public washrooms, student canteens, and libraries was calculated using quadratic averaging and subjective probability methods. During a one-week monitoring period, the public washrooms consumed 95.61 L of water per capita on the highest day, while the two canteens consumed 23.06 L and 22.55 L, respectively. These data show that water consumption is in line with the standard range. But on the maximum day of the library, the hourly variation factor was more than 1.5 ∼ 1.2, which is 206.67% of the upper limit of the standard value. Based on this analysis, the study recommended a water use quota value, which supported the revision of the water use quota and the effective implementation of the water-saving policy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Responses of gross primary productivity in different types of terrestrial ecosystems to interannual variation in the northern boundary of the East Asian summer monsoon,"The northern boundary of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASMNB), located in the transitional zone from humid to arid regions, is characterized by significant north-south fluctuations. These fluctuations can exert profound impacts on the photosynthetic activity of vegetation by causing anomalous climate conditions, and thus play an important role in the carbon cycle over large parts of northern China. In general, a more northward position of the EASMNB generally leads to increasing precipitation and decreasing incoming solar radiation (ISR) over most of northern China. The increasing precipitation leads to positive GPP anomalies in the temperate grassland over the western part of northern China, where water scarcity issues cause the high reliance of vegetation photosynthesis on dry-wet variability. In contrast, the decreasing ISR favors the occurrence of negative signals in the forest ecosystems over the eastern part of northern China, which holds strong resilience and resistance to dry-wet variability but sensitivity to ISR-induced changes in the available energy. Under this circumstance, the GPP responses are characterized by a zonal dipole pattern over northern China, with positive and negative signals situated over the western and eastern parts, respectively. The reverse pattern is also true when the EASMNB adopts a more southward position. Our findings highlight the distinctive impacts of EASMNB fluctuations on GPP changes among different land-cover types. Considering that the EASMNB is expected to shift northward under global warming, our study thus can provide important implications for the study of regional carbon cycles in a warmer world. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Natural resource management and green technological innovation impact on health risks and social development: Evidence from advanced economies,"In light of the far-reaching consequences of ineffective natural resource management, an expanding body of scholarly investigation has emphasized environmental and economic repercussions while largely overlooking the implications for public health and social development. The present research fills this gap by investigating the influence of green technological innovation and natural resource management on health risks and social development in eleven leading industrial economies. The analysis employs extensive second-generation econometrics techniques on data framework from 1990 to 2019, controlling for variables such as gross domestic product, economic complexity, fossil fuel consumption, and foreign direct investment. The results of the CS-ARDL model indicate that green technological innovations significantly reduce health risks in both the short and long run while also improving social development. Conversely, resource management increases health risks but also contributes to social development in underlying countries. Economic complexity initially increases health risks in the short run but eventually improves in the long run. Additionally, gross domestic product positively affects social development but imposes health risks in the long run. Robustness checks, specifically the AMG test, confirm the results’ consistency and reliability. The findings emphasize the importance of implementing appropriate resource policy measures to effectively reduce health risks through responsible resource management practices and the widespread diffusion of green technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental justice of Texas recreational water quality – The disproportionate E. coli levels and trends,"The presence of pathogens is one of the leading causes of stream water quality impairment in the US. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a fecal pathogen indicator and also signals the presence of more pathogenic microbes. Although it is reported that Black, Indigenous, and communities of color suffer more from E. coli contamination, there is a lack of investigation of the potential inequality of E. coli contamination in recreational waterbodies, particularly regarding whether this inequality persists over the long term. Using E. coli monitoring data from 1,424 stations from 2001 to 2021 in Texas, we tested the research hypotheses of racial and economic inequalities in E. coli levels and trends with quantile regression and logistic regression approaches. We found that economic disparities had a more significant relationship with E. coli contamination in Texas recreational waterbodies than racial disparities after controlling for building age, land covers, imperviousness, and precipitation. The economic disparities in E. coli contamination were more prevalent after 2010 and in extreme E. coli levels. In addition, implementing watershed protection plans could mitigate the economic disparities associated with the rising trend of E. coli levels between 2001 and 2021. Findings from this research underscore clean surface water deprivation from underserved communities and call for inclusive watershed management strategies to address the water quality injustice. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Performance evaluation of a novel humidification-dehumidification desalination system operated by a heat pump,"Decentralized and small-scale desalination technologies can effectively address the limitations associated with large-scale desalination systems and contribute to solving the issue of fresh water scarcity. However, low energy efficiency remains a primary obstacle in their widespread application. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a novel heat pump humidification-dehumidification desalination system, in which humid air from the dehumidifier enters the heat regenerator and heat pump evaporator in sequence, enabling deep dehumidification. Subsequently, the cold air is reheated by the heat regenerator and subcooler before entering the humidifier. This sequential process can increase not only the energy efficiency of heat pump but also the fresh water productivity. Models are proposed and calculated for the theoretical evaluation of the novel system. Firstly, heat pump design parameters are optimized. Subsequently, performances of the novel system under different operation conditions are compared with those of the conventional system. The results indicate that optimizing heat pump system design parameters can significantly improve system performance. When compared to the conventional system, the novel system exhibits significant improvements. It achieves a maximum fresh water productivity of 39.73kg/h, representing an increase of 12.83%, and a maximum gain output ratio of 6.52, which is 13.39% higher. The lowest fresh water production cost is 9.52 $/m3, also a reduction of 5.15%. Additionally, both the novel and conventional systems possess optimal feed temperature and mass flow rate ratio. At last, the optimal performances of the novel system are compared with the reported results, which further validates the thermodynamic and economic advantages of the novel system. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
How do energy prices and climate shocks affect human health? Insights from BRICS,"The presented work analyzes the energy prices, climate shock, and health deprivation nexus in the BRICS economies for the period 1995–2020.

The long-run estimates of energy prices are observed to be negatively significant to the health expenditure and life expectancy model, whereas, positively significant to the climate change model. These findings suggest that energy prices significantly reduce health expenditures and life expectancy and, thus, increase the death rate in the BRICS economies. The long-run country-wise estimate of energy prices is found negatively significant in case of Brazil, India, China, and South Africa. Alongside, the group-wise significance of CO2 emissions is discovered to be negatively, positively, and insignificant in the cases of life expectancy, death rate, and health expenditure models, respectively. Besides, country-wise long-run estimate of CO2 emissions witnesses negative significance for Russia, India, China, and South Africa. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Forecast of policy-driven land use change and its impact on ecosystem services in China: A case study of the Yangtze River Economic Belt,"Land use change is an important factor affecting the performance of ecosystem services (ESs). Therefore, understanding the impact of land use change on ESs is of great significance for promoting the coordination of regional human–land relationships. In this study, random forest and cellular automata were used to simulate and predict the characteristics of land use change in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and diversified land use evolution patterns were formed in combination with China's strategic development needs. The effects of habitat suitability on ESs were analyzed by using a multiscenario land use change model. The results demonstrated that the driving factors selected in this article had a good induction effect on the law of land use evolution, and the simulated land use change had high credibility. Under the mode of ecological protection and cultivated land protection, the expansion of construction land was greatly affected and was not conducive to social and economic development. Under the natural evolution mode, farmland was greatly encroached upon, and food security was greatly threatened. The regional coordination model had relative advantages, and all kinds of land use needs were met to a certain extent. The water production function of ESs was strong, but the carbon storage function was weak. The relationship between the habitat suitability index and ES changes under land use change revealed that there were significant differences in ES changes caused by ecological quality changes in mountainous and plain areas.

Resolving the conflict of greens: A GIS-based and participatory least-conflict siting framework for solar energy development in southwest Taiwan,"Transitioning to renewable energy is vital to reduce greenhouse gasses and mitigate climate change. As large-scale renewable energy development expands, more land use conflicts are arising between renewable energy development, ecological conservation, and local communities. Spatial planning methods are becoming more widely used to address such conflicts, however, they often lack local community input and values. In this study, we develop a Participatory Least Conflict Solar Energy Siting Framework based on energy justice theory which uses place-based stakeholder engagement paired with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographic Information System (GIS) based multi-criteria decision making. We operationalize a case study in Southwestern Taiwan to identify and evaluate suitable solar development sites and demonstrate how the framework can be used. The results of our AHP surveys show a general consensus that protecting the natural environment is important as the top three prioritized factors: “Avoid Environmental Protected Land”, with a priority of 20.8%, “Avoid Other Important Natural Areas”, with a priority of 11.9%, and “Avoid Other Natural Areas” with a priority of 8.2%. In addition, if only 12% of the land with medium to high suitability are developed for solar energy generation, Tainan City and Chiayi County alone could support the Taiwan government's solar development goal of 20 GW of installed solar capacity for the entire country by 2025. Our study also reveals that the use of participatory methods in site evaluation and final site design is important to ensure true suitability with local ecological, social, and economic systems. This methodology helps to normalize a more holistic multi-goal strategy of solar development that recognizes renewable energy infrastructure as part of a social-ecological-technical systems and Climate Justice. We suggest this framework be used to address the spatial mismatch between national level policy and local implementation that supports place-based renewable energy collocation for energy democracy and community ownership, and develop policy and regulations to support a just transition toward carbon neutrality. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Household carbon footprints inequality in China: Drivers, components and dynamics","The significant achievements in economic growth and urbanization in China have recently led to substantial increases of and great inequality in household carbon footprints (HCFs). To achieve efficiency and justice in emissions reduction, policymakers need to fully understand the sources of HCFs and identify the major causes of carbon inequality. By applying the Unconditional Quantile Regression (UQR) model and decomposition method to the Chinese household survey data, this paper investigates the distributional features of HCFs and their determinants. We find that HCFs are unevenly distributed due to differences in the volume and pattern of consumption, which are further determined by household characteristics and lifestyles. The intertemporal lifestyle changes have played a major role in the rise of HCFs inequality measured by various quantile emissions differentials. In addition, considerable increases in HCFs come from the high carbon emission groups, and most of the HCFs inequality stems from the 90–50 emissions differential. To transform the current carbon-intensive economy, policies are required to enhance environmental equity and encourage low-carbon lifestyles. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Chelated copper reduces yet manganese fertilizer increases calcium-silica fouling in brackish water drip irrigation systems,"Water scarcity and deficiency of trace elements (e.g., Cu and Mn) in soils of arid and semi-arid areas are major constrains to crop growth and development. The application of brackish water drip irrigation system (BWDIs), coupled with trace elements, is probably an effective way to solve this problem. However, fouling problems caused by trace elements in BWDIs were inevitable. Therefore, this paper evaluates the mechanism of different types of trace element chelated fertilizers on the fouling of emitters in BWDIs by using long-period, high-frequency periodic flow monitoring and mineral fraction analysis. The influence of chelated fertilizers such as copper (EDTA-Cu) and manganese (EDTA-Mn), and traditional micro-fertilizers copper sulfate (CuSO4) and manganese sulfate (MnSO4) on emitter fouling in BWDIs were investigated. Results suggested, compared with CK, the EDTA-Cu effectively alleviated the emitter fouling, increasing the average discharge ratio (Dra) and Christiansen coefficient of uniformity (CU) by 21.0%− 28.9% and 36.7%− 67.6%, respectively. Due to the strong adsorption ability, EDTA-Cu adsorb the Ca2+ and Mg2+ in BWDIs, which enhanced the structural stability, reduced the flocculation and deposition ability in the fouling, and indirectly reduced the content of calcium and silica fouling. In addition, compared with CK, the EDTA-Mn significantly aggravated the emitter fouling in BWDIs, decreasing the Dra and CU by 18.2%− 22.5% and 24.5%− 43.1% respectively. EDTA-Mn directly increased the content of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in BWDIs due to strong flocculation, which destroyed the morphology of EDTA-Mn chelates and indirectly increased the content of calcium silica fouling (calcite, muscovite, k-feldspar, dolomite and chlorite), thus reduced the anti-clogging ability of BWDIs. Considering these results, this study does not recommend the application of EDTA-Mn for manganese fertilizer in BWDIs. This study provides a new perspective on the rapid application of micronutrient fertilization in BWDIs, with potential implications for sustainable development in arid and semi-arid areas. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Agricultural Insurance, Climate Change, and Food Security: Evidence from Chinese Farmers","As an effective risk management mechanism, agricultural insurance can reduce the risk of uncertainty in agricultural production and guarantee food security. Based on Chinese provincial panel data from 2003 to 2020, this study uses the Entropy Method to measure food security and systematically examines the impact of climate change and agricultural insurance on food security as well as its mechanisms. The present study found that climate change, especially extreme temperatures, has a significant negative impact on food security and food production. The promotion effect of agricultural insurance on food security increases with increased investments in technology, education, and other factors. Furthermore, our findings suggest the presence of geographical variations in the contribution of agricultural insurance to ensuring food security, with greater coverage in major food-producing regions. Additionally, maize yields are better protected by agricultural insurance than wheat and rice yields. To encourage sustainable agricultural development, the Chinese government should set up a diversified subsidy scheme with various planting scales and plant structures. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Potential benefits of liming to acid soils on climate change mitigation and food security,"Globally, about 50% of all arable soils are classified as acidic. As crop and plant growth are significantly hampered under acidic soil conditions, many farmers, but increasingly as well forest managers, apply lime to raise the soil pH. Besides its direct effect on soil pH, liming also affects soil C and nutrient cycles and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed 1570 observations reported in 121 field-based studies worldwide, to assess liming effects on soil GHG fluxes and plant productivity. We found that liming significantly increases crop yield by 36.3%. Also, soil organic C (SOC) stocks were found to increase by 4.51% annually, though soil respiration is stimulated too (7.57%). Moreover, liming was found to reduce soil N2O emission by 21.3%, yield-scaled N2O emission by 21.5%, and CH4 emission and yield-scaled CH4 emission from rice paddies by 19.0% and 12.4%, respectively. Assuming that all acid agricultural soils are limed periodically, liming results in a total GHG balance benefit of 633−749 Tg CO2-eq year−1 due to reductions in soil N2O emissions (0.60−0.67 Tg N2O-N year−1) and paddy soil CH4 emissions (1.75−2.21 Tg CH4 year−1) and increases in SOC stocks (65.7–110 Tg C year−1). However, this comes at the cost of an additional CO2 release (c. 624–656 Tg CO2 year−1) deriving from lime mining, transport and application, and lime dissolution, so that the overall GHG balance is likely neutral. Nevertheless, liming of acid agricultural soils will increase yields by at least 6.64 × 108 Mg year−1, covering the food supply of 876 million people. Overall, our study shows for the first time that a general strategy of liming of acid agricultural soils is likely to result in an increasing sustainability of global agricultural production, indicating the potential benefit of liming acid soils for climate change mitigation and food security. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamic evolution and spatial convergence of the virtual cultivated land flow intensity in China,"Exploring the flow intensity of virtual cultivated land is the key to improving the ecological compensation and food security policy. This study aimed to analyze the dynamic evolution, spatial convergence, and its affecting factors of the virtual cultivated land flow intensity. The spatial convergence model was used in this study. The results showed that, during 2000–2018, the growth rate of the surplus state of virtual cultivated land at the national level is less than that of the deficit state of virtual cultivated land in China. Moreover, the number of deficit provinces of virtual cultivated land flow intensity is increasing. The absolute β-convergence characteristics of the virtual cultivated land flow intensity are significant at the national, northeast, central, and western regions. Additionally, the conditional β-convergence exists at the national and four regional levels. Meanwhile, cultivated land resource endowment, population scale, regional economic development level, and agricultural mechanization level play an important role in the convergence process of inter-regional virtual cultivated land flow intensity. However, the influence degree of different control variables on different regional virtual cultivated land flow intensity is not consistent. Therefore, policymakers should pay attention to cultivated land resources’ spatial transfer mechanism when making regional cultivated land ecological compensation policies to coordinate the interesting relationship between the deficit area and surplus area of virtual cultivated land. Therefore, it is necessary to take the virtual cultivated land flow intensity as the reference index and use the combination of market guidance and government control to stimulus the stakeholders to protect cultivated land by taking different measures. © 2021 by the authors.

Virtual water and CO2 emission footprints embodied in power trade: EU-27,"The European Union (EU) has the world's most extensive regional power trade, making it essential for the EU environmental energy policies. Understanding the nexus amongst water, power and CO2 emissions is essential for sustainable water and energy resource management. Although a number of related studies on the nexus have been conducted, integrating virtual water and CO2 emission footprints for the power sector requires further attention. The current study analyses the virtual water and CO2 emissions embodied in the power supply, demand and regional trade. A network model is developed to track the virtual water and CO2 emissions of the inter-regional power trade for the case of EU-27 countries in 2017. The total virtual CO2 emissions and the embodied virtual water in the EU inter-regional power trade are estimated as 7.0 × 104 t CO2 and 5.6 × 108 m3, with a hydropower contribution of 37.8%. The largest virtual water and CO2 emissions exporters are identified by France (8.8 × 107 m3) and Germany (2 × 104 t), whilst the largest virtual CO2 importer is Austria (1 × 104 t). The identified synergy of climate mitigation and water scarcity provides a benchmark for policymakers to develop strategies for sustainable power development considering the virtual footprint in trade flow simultaneously. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The dynamic relationship between economic growth and life expectancy: Contradictory role of energy consumption and financial development in Pakistan,"This paper tends to investigate the linkage between economic growth and life expectancy by considering the potential role of financial development and energy consumption using data of Pakistan. Traditional as well as advanced unit root tests for observing the stationary properties of the variables were applied. For exploring the cointegration levels among life expectancy and its determinants, ARDL bounds testing technique in the existence of structural breaks which were stemming in the data has been investigated. The empirical results provide the confirmation for the presence of cointegration between the variables. Further, economic growth is positively associated with life expectancy. Financial development is revealing a negative effect on life expectancy in the scenario of Pakistan. Energy consumption lowers life expectancy via environmental degradation. Furthermore, this empirical analysis provides new insights to policymakers for using financial development and energy consumption as economic tools to improve life expectancy by directing energy and finance policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
The mystery of local fiscal expenditure and carbon emission growth in China,"This study investigates the relationship between financial expenditure and carbon emission reduction using provincial-level dynamic panel data from 1996 to 2010. A positive correlation exists between the scale of financial expenditure and per capita carbon emissions, whereas a negative correlation exists between the composition of financial expenditure and per capita carbon emissions. The effects of subentry spending on the carbon emission reduction differ. An improvement in the relief structure of social security increases per capita carbon emissions, whereas an improvement in the composition of medical treatment and public health has no effect on per capita carbon emissions. Other forms of “pro-carbon emission reduction” spending lead to a reduction in per capita carbon emissions. An improvement in the composition of financial expenditure leads to a reduction in the carbon emissions of the second and third industries only. Meanwhile, the effect of the scale of financial expenditure is widespread across all industries. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"Prohibited grazing policy satisfaction and life satisfaction in rural northwest china—a case study in yanchi county, ningxia hui autonomous region","In order to restore degraded grasslands, the Chinese central government initiated the Prohibited Grazing Policy (PGP) in areas of severe grassland degradation and ecologically fragile regions which is an important payment for ecosystem services (PES) program. Since the initiation of this policy in the early 2000s, the PGP has significantly influenced participants’ lives. Therefore, in order for the policy to be successful, it is necessary to understand what determines participants’ satisfaction in the policy. This paper presents an analysis of survey data from Yanchi County using ordered probit regression models to explore the factors influencing PGP satisfaction and life satisfaction. The empirical results suggest that farmers’ policy perception, environmental perception, and livelihood strategies of raising sheep had significant effects on PGP satisfaction. Additionally, PGP satisfaction, marital status, environmental satisfaction, self-reported influence of the PGP on income, self-reported income level, and self-reported income and expenditure had significantly positive effects on overall life satisfaction. These results are important for promoting better implementation of such programs as well as enhancing social stability and sustainable development in these regions. © 2019 by the authors.

"Dynamics of sewage charge policies, environmental protection industry and polluting Enterprises-A case study in China","The game model of sewage charges, based on incremental mode, was developed. Four modes of high/low sewage charge standards were utilized to analyze the relationship between control strategy on sewage discharge and the development of environmental protection industry. Results showed that the selection of control strategy was heavily dependent on the level of sewage charges. An empirical study was carried out to investigate the environmental protection industry in 31 regions in China in 2010. It was revealed that the sewage charge standards, formulated by the local governments and the development of environmental protection industry, varied significantly in different regions. The optimal level of environmental quality and social welfare, as a whole, was not achieved in China. It is proposed that different regions should adopt different sewage charges standards based on their economic development level and the current environmental quality. Similarly, the scientific and technological innovation of environmental protection industry should be further strengthened. © 2014 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Rainwater resource utilization and ecosystem sustainability in arid agricultural areas: A review on 2013 international workshop on arid agriculture and ecosystem sustainability,"With the increasing occurrence of global climate change, dryland agriculture and ecosystem sustainability have been receiving more attention from the governments and ecologists worldwide. This paper reviewed all the 28 presentations in the International Workshop on Arid Agriculture and Ecosystem Sustainability held at Lanzhou University from 15 to 18 October, 2013. The presentations focused on the workshop theme of “efficient use of water resources and sustainable management of ecosystem”. Major aspects were summarized in this workshop such as opportunities and challenges in dryland agriculture, efficient utilization of rainwater resources, conservation of biodiversity in dry areas, construction of bio-information system, sustainable ecosystem management, and enhancement of international cooperation among developing countries. Finally, on the basis of stratified feature and distinct theory of ecosystem management, we summarized the progress in agricultural water resources utilization and ecosystem management in dry areas in recent years. A conceptual diagram regarding coupling relationship between ecological conservation and agricultural production was constructed. It was aimed to provide potential theoretical evidence for food security, farmers’ livelihood improvement, sustainable ecosystem management and harmonious socio-economic development under the background of climate change. © 2014, editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

Local melon and watermelon crop populations to moderate yield responses to climate change in North Africa,"Climate change is having a tremendous influence on world food production, with arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas especially susceptible. In these areas, locally adapted crop varieties or landraces can be used to mitigate the influence of climate change on current and future food security challenges. The high genetic diversity within these populations allows for crops to adapt to changing environments or other stresses that influence growth and productivity. Thus, local Moroccan melon (Cucumis melo) and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) landraces were compared to pure-line varieties in southwestern Morocco to identify their adaptability and possible ability to mitigate current and future climate change. Results indicated that the melon and watermelon landraces evaluated most likely could help mitigate yield losses from climate change in this area of Morocco. ‘AitOulyad’, a local muskmelon type, and ‘Rasmouka Ananas’ were both outstanding melon landraces with high plant vigor and yields. For watermelon, ‘AitOulyad’ had extremely high yields but had high numbers of seed in the flesh, while ‘Rasmouka’ had a lower yield, fewer seeds in the flesh, and a higher fruit consistency. This research indicates that melon and watermelon landraces in this area of southwestern Morocco with a semi-arid to arid climate will continue to play a major role in crop adaptation to maintain high productivity under a rapidly changing environment. © 2021 by the authors.

A new approach to conservation: Using community empowerment for sustainable well-being,"The global environmental conservation community recognizes that the participation of local communities is essential for the success of conservation initiatives; however, much work remains to be done on how to integrate conservation and human wellbeing. We propose that an assets-based approach to environmental conservation and human well-being, which is grounded in a biocultural framework, can support sustainable and adaptive management of natural resources by communities in regions adjacent to protected areas. We present evidence from conservation and quality of life initiatives led by the Field Museum of Natural History over the past 17 years in the Peruvian Amazon. Data were derived from asset mapping in 37 communities where rapid inventories were conducted and from 38 communities that participated in longer term quality of life planning. Our main findings are that Amazonian communities have many characteristics, or assets, that recent scholarship has linked to environmental sustainability and good natural resource stewardship, and that quality of life plans that are based on these assets tend to produce priorities that are more consistent with environmental conservation. Importantly, we found that validating social and ecological assets through our approach can contribute to the creation of protected areas and to their long-term management. As strategies to engage local communities in conservation expand, research on how particular methodologies, such as an assets-based approach, is needed to determine how these initiatives can best empower local communities, how they can be improved, and how they can most effectively be linked to broader conservation and development processes. © 2017 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
What keeps neonatal nurses up at night and what gets them up in the morning?,"Background: Occupational stress in neonatal nursing is a significant professional concern. Prolonged exposure to morally distressing patient care experiences and other healthcare issues may lead to worry among nurses. When worry becomes excessive, nurses and advanced practice registered nurses may lose joy that gives meaning to their work. Enhancing meaning in work may have a positive impact on nurse satisfaction, engagement, productivity, and burnout. Purpose: To explore neonatal nurses' top professional satisfiers and top professional worries and concerns. Methods: A descriptive study was conducted in a convenience sample of neonatal nurses to identify the top professional satisfiers that get them up in the morning and the top professional worries and concerns that keep them awake at night. Results: Complete data were available for 29 neonatal nurses. The top professional satisfiers were caring for infants and families, making a difference, witnessing resilience, intellectual challenge of specialty, positive working relationships with colleagues, and educating parents and families. The top professional worries and concerns were staffing, missed care, workload, making a mistake, and failure to rescue. Implications for Practice: Healthcare and professional organizations must develop strategies to address occupational stress in today's complex healthcare environment. Identifying professional worries and concerns may help nurses navigate challenging and distressing situations. Furthermore, understanding nurses' professional satisfiers may promote personal and professional resiliency and help organizations create healthier workplace environments. Implications for Research: Future studies are needed to test effective interventions that may promote professional satisfaction and help neonatal nurses cope with occupational stressors. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Cost of environmental flow during water scarcity in the arid Huasco River basin, northern Chile","This investigation presents a new approach to estimate the costs resulting from the introduction of environmental flows in the arid Huasco River basin, located in the Atacama Region of Chile, one of the most sophisticated private water markets worldwide. The aim is to provide information to the water users, who hold the right to decide on water use, and thereby support the inclusion of environmental flows into decision-making. Costs are estimated by calculating the loss of agricultural productivity resulting from a trade-off between users and environmental flow requirements in times of water scarcity. Based on environmental flow requirements calculated by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and hydrological supply-and-demand modelling using the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model, economic parameters of water productivity are calculated for the main economic sectors and then included in hydrological analysis. The study presents concrete costs that might be imposed on the water users during times of water scarcity, and confirms that there are significant variations in water productivity between different sectors.

Making sustainability in occupational therapy visible by relating to the Agenda 2030 goals–A case description of a Swedish university,"Occupational therapy has a lot to contribute to sustainable development considering the discipline’s occupational focus and knowledge. This has been recognised by researchers and professional associations, but there is still a scarcity of research explicitly mentioning sustainability. Relevant contributions may be identified by relating education and research to the Agenda 2030 sustainable development goals. The aim of this article was to describe explicit and implicit inclusion of sustainable development and Agenda 2030 goals in occupational therapy education and research at one Swedish university. Current course syllabi and study guides, as well as research over the past five-year period, were examined and related to sustainability. The results showed that although only a few courses and articles were explicitly related to sustainable development, more course and research content became relevant when this content was compared with the sustainable development goals. It can be concluded that sustainability was more extensively addressed than first visible, but further studies including more universities are warranted. © 2020 The Author(s).

Modeling global water use for the 21st century: The Water Futures and Solutions (WFaS) initiative and its approaches,"To sustain growing food demand and increasing standard of living, global water use increased by nearly 6 times during the last 100 years, and continues to grow. As water demands get closer and closer to the water availability in many regions, each drop of water becomes increasingly valuable and water must be managed more efficiently and intensively. However, soaring water use worsens water scarcity conditions already prevalent in semi-arid and arid regions, increasing uncertainty for sustainable food production and economic development. Planning for future development and investments requires that we prepare water projections for the future. However, estimations are complicated because the future of the world's waters will be influenced by a combination of environmental, social, economic, and political factors, and there is only limited knowledge and data available about freshwater resources and how they are being used. The Water Futures and Solutions (WFaS) initiative coordinates its work with other ongoing scenario efforts for the sake of establishing a consistent set of new global water scenarios based on the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and the representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The WFaS ""fast-track"" assessment uses three global water models, namely H08, PCR-GLOBWB, and WaterGAP. This study assesses the state of the art for estimating and projecting water use regionally and globally in a consistent manner. It provides an overview of different approaches, the uncertainty, strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods, types of management and policy decisions for which the current estimation methods are useful. We also discuss additional information most needed to be able to improve water use estimates and be able to assess a greater range of management options across the water-energy-climate nexus. © 2016 Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability of global water use: Past reconstruction and future projections,"Overuse of surface water and an increasing reliance on nonrenewable groundwater resources have been reported over various regions of the world, casting significant doubt on the sustainable water supply and food production met by irrigation. To assess the limitations of global water resources, numerous indicators have been developed, but they rarely consider nonrenewable water use. In addition, surface water over-abstraction is rarely assessed in the context of human and environmental water needs. Here, we perform a transient assessment of global water use over the historical period 1960-2010 as well as the future projections of 2011-2099, using a newly developed indicator: the blue water sustainability index (BlWSI). The BlWSI incorporates both nonrenewable groundwater use and nonsustainable water use that compromises environmental flow requirements. Our results reveal an increasing trend of water consumed from nonsustainable surface water and groundwater resources over the historical period (∼30%), and this increase is projected to continue further towards the end of this century (∼40%). The global amount of nonsustainable water consumption has been increasing especially since the late 1990s, despite a wetter climate and increasing water availability during this period. The BlWSI is the first tool suitable for consistently evaluating the renewability and degradation of surface water and groundwater resources as a result of human water over-abstraction. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Challenges hampering water infrastructure development in Africa,"The article discusses the difficulties that water infrastructure faces in African context. The need to create effective and efficient water infrastructure is highlighted, as well as the connection between water and the objectives of sustainable development goal (SDG) 6. The information included in the article was gathered through a literature review and is based on qualitative desktop analysis. The internet, Acts, government documents, journal articles, annual reports, and journal papers are a few examples of secondary sources of information. The findings point out several difficulties with the development of water infrastructure, including migration, climate change, population growth, urbanization, deteriorated infrastructure, water scarcity, poverty, a lack of financial and human resources, as well as poor maintenance of water infrastructure. The economic, political, technological, infrastructural, environmental, ecological, and institutional aspects that negatively affect infrastructure development are presented in the article. The article suggests using public-private partnerships (PPPs) as an alternate solution to the problem. The article therefore aim is to examine the challenges in water infrastructure as well as the role that PPPs play in it. PPPs' role in the development of water infrastructure is described, with an emphasis on best practices that Africa might follow to improve water infrastructure. Therefore, the study looks at how PPPs were used in a few countries that had water-related problems and evaluates how PPP implementation enhanced the water infrastructure built in the selected countries. These evaluations offer best practices and insights that African nations with weak water infrastructure might use. The article therefore aims to examine the benefits and difficulties of developing water infrastructure as well as the role that PPPs play in it. The article aims to create awareness regarding the challenges hampering the realization of SDG 6 in Africa, and hence contributes to the disciplines of public administration/management /governance and water studies. © 2023, Ontario International Development Agency.

"Large dams and sustainable development: A case-study of the Sardar Sarovar Project, India","Along with being a basic human need, water is also a basic constituent for the survival of eco-systems of which people and their cultures are important components. The water resources distribution in India, predominantly an agrarian economy, is highly asymmetric and has been accompanied by severe decline in per-capita water availability during the past 50 years, with agriculture being the maximum water user, leading to over-exploitation of ground water and steadily depleting water tables along with a heavy energy bill. Gujarat State falls in a water stressed zone of the country and is also the victim of intra-state asymmetric water availability leading to an unwanted socio-economic disparity, with the following results: a poor literacy rate in water-deficit districts; concentration of industry and housing in regions with better water resources endowment; and demographic change, e.g. the shift of the prime workforce from drought-prone districts to water-surplus districts. This in turn denies the right to life, development, health, food, education and work for these migrant communities. To ensure a balanced development when there is less than one acre per capita of cultivable landholding and over 14 000 villages out of 18 563 are suffering from water scarcity, there is no other alternative but to transfer water from surplus to scarce areas of the state.

Status Anxiety: Hong Kong’s Crisis of Identity,"In this book, retired banking CEO Bruce VonCannon considers the past, present and future of Hong Kong, the dynamic finance-driven autonomous city that is beset by global issues- US-China tension, income inequality, housing scarcity, climate change- within the microcosm of a small island archipelago and a hyper-specific local culture. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is today one of the world’s foremost economic and financial hubs and a repository for 18% of the world’s stored wealth, home to the region’s most vibrant stock market, a major free trade port city and traditional gateway to mainland China, the world’s 2nd largest economy. The recent street protests which broke out in June 2019 have been described as a pro-democracy movement. However, other analysts disagree and argue that the street protests have more in common with the populist movements springing up in other parts of the world as the result of a growing divide between rich and poor. This book delves into financial realities, Hong Kong’s position within the new global competition between China and the United States, and as a model for the urbanization of the future. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
"2°C and SDGs: United they stand, divided they fall?","The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the new international climate treaty could put 2015 into the history books as a defining year for setting human development on a more sustainable pathway. The global climate policy and SDG agendas are highly interconnected: The way that the climate problem is addressed strongly affects the prospects of meeting numerous other SDGs and vice versa. Drawing on existing scenario results from a recent energy-economy-climate model inter-comparison project, this letter analyses these synergies and (risk) trade-offs of alternative 2 °C pathways across indicators relevant for energy-related SDGs and sustainable energy objectives. We find that limiting the availability of key mitigation technologies yields some co-benefits and decreases risks specific to these technologies but greatly increases many others. Fewer synergies and substantial trade-offs across SDGs are locked into the system for weak short-term climate policies that are broadly in line with current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), particularly when combined with constraints on technologies. Lowering energy demand growth is key to managing these trade-offs and creating synergies across multiple energy-related SD dimensions. We argue that SD considerations are central for choosing socially acceptable 2 °C pathways: The prospects of meeting other SDGs need not dwindle and can even be enhanced for some goals if appropriate climate policy choices are made. Progress on the climate policy and SDG agendas should therefore be tracked within a unified framework. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Does international climate finance contribute to the adoption of zero deforestation policies? Insights from Brazil and Indonesia,"International climate finance (ICF) is a critical mechanism for reducing deforestation and supporting global climate cooperation, yet its effectiveness is often questioned on account of scale and implementation challenges. This paper addresses the question whether ICF, implemented through Official Development Assistance (ODA), is catalysing policy adoption in the land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) sectors of Brazil and Indonesia and henceforth contributes to global climate cooperation. We deploy a novel analytical framework, which assesses the role of ICF in transnational policy processes, and analyse how international and domestic factors influence its effectiveness in supporting LULUCF policy adoption. We find that ICF actors are caught in a dilemma between stated objectives of policy reform and ambitious transformational change while at the same time have their legitimacy questioned as participants in domestic policy processes. Ultimately, political access to decision making spheres on policy adoption for climate and land use are denied to them. In Brazil, competing coalitions debate the implementation of the national forest law, while in Indonesia, ICF is confined to technocratic policy spheres, leaving critical decisions to the political economy sphere. Our findings suggest that for ICF to be effective in catalysing policy adoption and global cooperation, it must address legitimacy concerns through political dialogue and shift from ODA approaches towards equitable cooperation, which involves donors' policy efforts as well. To be politically attractive, better alignment of ICF with national development objectives is also crucial, which could take the form of just transition for climate and land use. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Attic dust reflects long-term airborne contamination of an industrial area: A case study from Ajka, Hungary","Recent research suggests that airborne pollutants, deposited in the urban environment, can be efficiently studied by attic dust analysis. Here, an attic dust study was carried out to determine the long-term airborne contamination load in the industrial town of Ajka, Hungary, by attic dust analysis. The spatial distribution of trace element contamination in airborne attic dust samples was to be mapped in order to relate spatial distribution to potential sources. The sampling strategy followed a grid-based stratified random design and samples were collected in 27 houses in the 64km2 project area. Houses with attics intact for at least 30-40years were chosen to represent long-term industrial pollution. The concentrations of six trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) were measured with ICP-OES, whereas Hg content was analyzed by CV-AAS. Measured concentrations above the environmental standards were encountered. The univariate distribution analysis shows that Pb, Hg, Zn and Cd distribution is dominated by anthropogenic sources, and characterized by high extreme values, such as elevated Hg-concentrations around the lignite-fired power plant. Arsenic and Cu-distributions seem equally influenced by background and anthropogenic processes. Nickel shows lower concentrations and variability, and its major source is the natural geochemical background. To study the geochemical element behavior, a correlation analysis was performed to estimate the metal sorption to Fe-oxy-hydroxide phases. Results show a good spatial correlation of contamination and sources such as lignite mines, lignite-fired power plant and traffic. Attic dust appears to be an efficient and cheap sampling medium to study and map long-term airborne contamination and possibly associated human health risks in an industrial setting. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Ensuring access to essential health products: Lessons from Colombia’s leishmaniasis control and elimination initiative,"Background This paper identifies opportunities and challenges for leishmaniasis control and elimination in Colombia, emphasizing the role of pooled procurement of essential medicines and sup-plies. Colombia is among the countries most affected by leishmaniasis globally, and also faces the dual challenge of procuring critically needed medicines in the context of limited national resources. It recently renewed its commitment to the control and elimination of leishmaniasis under its 2022–2031 Public Health Plan (PDSP) through a comprehensive public health approach. Methodology/Principal findings The methodology comprises a comprehensive literature review and key informant inter-views with leishmaniasis experts from the Colombian national control program and PAHO/ WHO, focusing on cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is endemic throughout Colombia, with over 11 million people at risk, many of whom live in poverty-stricken, remote and isolated rural areas with limited access to health services. Leishmaniasis care, including medicines, is provided free of charge, but many barriers were nonetheless identified at environmental, population, and health system levels, including the supply of quality-assured medicines. Opportunities to alleviate these barriers were identified, including the support of the PAHO Strategic Fund. Within the context of the sustainable development goals and international leishmaniasis control and elimination targets, Colombian officials have established their own priorities, the highest of which is the reduction of deaths from visceral leishmaniasis. Conclusions/Significance The elimination of leishmaniasis as a public health problem presents significant challenges, given its biological complexity and diversity, physical and clinical manifestations, social and economic impacts, frequently burdensome treatment regimens, and insufficient supply of necessary medicines. However, rigorous prevention and control efforts through strong political commitment and a highly motivated workforce can dramatically reduce its burden. Colombia’s new PDSP, which highlights leishmaniasis control, is an opportunity for a revitalized health system response through committed leadership, intersectoral actions, and partnerships with international organizations that share a common vision. © 2023 Vlassoff et al.",Not About Sufficiency
"The cassava crop: Cultivation, potential uses, and food security","Cassava is the 4th most consumed root crop that contributes to dietary energy in the tropics (after rice, sugar, and maize). Thus, cassava continues to be recommended as a key food for human consumption, especially in the face of current population growth, related problems with food supply, food and nutrition security, and global climate change challenges. Research on cassava crops aims to improve agricultural resource management, and breeding. Along with seed production, crop protection, post-harvest practices, storage, supply chain, potential uses, and food security. There has also been significant technological advances in cassava production systems that have remarkably improved cassava yields and the technological processing of derivatives. However, these developments are still poorly understood throughout the world. This book, therefore, aims to provide an overview of the current state of sustainable cassava production systems, improve processing and potential uses, to achieve global food security targets by presenting research, case studies, experiences, opinions, and critical comments from various agroecological regions of the world. © 2024 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A Comprehensive Material Flow Account for Lao PDR to Inform Environmental and Sustainability Policy,"Modern environmental and sustainability policy that acknowledges the linkages between socioeconomic processes and environmental pressures and impacts, and designs policies to decouple economic activity from environmental pressures and impacts, requires a sophisticated and comprehensive knowledge base. The concept of industrial metabolism provides a sound conceptual base, and material flow accounting—including primary material inputs and outflows of waste and emissions—provides a well-accepted operationalization. Studies presenting a comprehensive material flow account for a national economy are rare, especially for developing countries. Countries such as Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR or Laos) face dual objectives of improving the material standard of living of their people while managing natural resources sustainably and mitigating adverse environmental impacts from growing resource throughput. Our research fills a knowledge gap, presents a comprehensive account of material inputs and outflows of waste and emissions for the Lao PDR national economy, and applies the accounting approach for a low-income economy in Asia. We present a material balance for the years 2000 and 2015. For this research, we used data from Lao PDR national statistics and the accounting guidelines of the European Statistical Office (Eurostat), which pioneered the use of material flow data as part of its official statistical reporting. We demonstrate the feasibility of the accounting approach and discuss the robustness of results using uncertainty analysis conducted with statistical approaches commonly used in the field of industrial ecology, including Gauss's law of error propagation and Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the fast-changing scale and composition of Lao PDR material flows, waste, and emissions presents challenges to the existing policy capacity and will require investment into governance of changed patterns of material use, waste disposal, and emissions. We consider the data analysis sufficiently robust to inform such a change in policy direction. © 2018 by Yale University",Not About Sufficiency
AquaYOLO: Advanced YOLO-based fish detection for optimized aquaculture pond monitoring,"Aquaculture plays an important role in ensuring global food security, supporting economic growth, and protecting natural resources. However, traditional methods of monitoring aquatic environments are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, there is growing interest in using computer vision for more efficient aqua monitoring. Fish detection is a key challenging step in these vision-based systems, as it faces challenges such as changing light conditions, varying water clarity, different types of vegetation, and dynamic backgrounds. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new model called AquaYOLO, an optimized model specifically designed for aquaculture applications. The backbone of AquaYOLO employs CSP layers and enhanced convolutional operations to extract hierarchical features. The head enhances feature representation through upsampling, concatenation, and multi-scale fusion. The detection head uses a precise 40 × 40 scale for box regression and dropping the final C2f layer to ensure accurate localization. To test the AquaYOLO model, we utilize DePondFi dataset (Detection of Pond Fish) collected from aquaponds in South India. DePondFi dataset contains around 50k bounding box annotations across 8150 images. Proposed AquaYOLO model performs well, achieving a precision, recall and mAP@50 of 0.889, 0.848, and 0.909 respectively. Our model ensures efficient and affordable fish detection for small-scale aquaculture. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency

Natural resources exploitation and social sustainability: An ex-ante regional policy simulation using EU-SILC data,"This paper provides an ex-ante assessment of the impact on income distribution of a social card to support poor families in the Basilicata region, Italy, funded by fiscal revenues from oil extraction. The distributive effects of this policy are assessed by combining microeconomic information from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) with a two-region social accounting matrix (SAM). The simulations show that a proper design of the policy could lead to relevant improvement of equity and poverty indicators, contributing to regional sustainability. The analysis has shown that the EU-SILC data sample, combined with a SAM, can be used to support the design of an evidence-based regional development policy. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of biodiversity in the provision of ecosystem services,"All organisms respond to and change their environment to a greater or lesser degree. This interaction affects their survival and that of other organisms. Humankind is no different: it has responded to and altered its environment. For example, humans burn landscapes and domesticate plants and animals (Schleidt and Schalter, 2003; Archibald et al., 2012). However, unprecedented in the history of our earth is the extent of environmental changes brought about by this single species (Haberl et al., 2007; Rockström et al., 2009a; Klein Goldewijk et al., 2011). Our presence is identifiable everywhere on earth, thus, the current geological epoch has been dubbed the Anthropocene (Steffen et al., 2007) and humankind exploits all earth’s ecosystems, whether seemingly pristine like the vast ice fields of Antarctica and the high seas of the open ocean, or highly modified and regulated, like the terraced rice fields of Asia or dykes of the Netherlands. Ecosystems provide us with a range of goods and perform services without which humans would go extinct. While some ecosystems have been optimized by humans to deliver and sustain a specific service, few services have been fully incorporated into a market economy whereas several are being depleted without societal appreciation (Fisher et al., 2008; Rockstram et al., 2009a; Bateman et al., 2010). The notion of imminent depletion has led concerned scientists to draw up the MEA (MEA, 2005). The MEA analysed the present condition of the earths ecosystems as an integrated product of changes in biodiversity, environmental change, and their effect on ecosystem services. The assessment concluded that much of the gain in economic growth and human well-being over the last century has been possible because of large-scale exploitation of the services that natural ecosystems provide. The resulting degradation of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity is thought to diminish future use of ecosystem services and to endanger our planet’s sustainability. Rockstrm et al. (2009a) have framed this in the form of eight planetary boundary indicators that together depict a safe operating space for humankind (Figure 2.1). For many indicators the world is considered to be close to the edge and among these biodiversity loss was judged to be the furthest outside the planetary boundary. © Cambridge University Press 2015.

Sustainability in residue management: a review with special reference to Indian agriculture,"Burning agricultural waste emerged as a prominent air pollution source that is widely prevalent across the entire Indian subcontinent, primarily in the Northern states. Cereal crops (primarily rice and wheat) in the North and sugarcane residues in other parts of the country contribute majorly to the burning of waste biomass. Massive increase in various harmful gases, including sulfur compounds and particulate matter, from the burning agricultural residues is linked to increasing health conditions, grave diseases and lowering of life expectancy of people affected by this practice. This review outlines the existing strategies followed in managing the agricultural waste residues, primarily in India, their limitations, the sustainable biotechnological interventions for the same and the current state of affairs in the interventions proposed. Innovations in mechanical stubble removal techniques and real-time monitoring aided by artificial intelligence tools will go a long way in curing this practice. Two primary aspects that are being promoted and hold much scope are the sensitization of farmer community and other stakeholders, including policy makers, involved in the production and dissemination of these residues, and establishing a commercial, decentralized market for the residues generated. Generation of value products from stubble will be the most helpful intervention in ensuring a positive action by the farmers. Some of the potential commercial applications include use of crop residues in sustainable architecture, as packing materials for commercial products, for the production of building/roofing materials, conversion to biochar for various applications, for biofuel generation, as substrate in mushroom cultivation and as raw material in the process of fermentation for producing various enzymes and other products of commercial value. Government initiatives and support as well as private partnerships are vital for the success of the endeavors. © 2023, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering.",Not About Sufficiency

Intra and inter basin linking of rivers in water resources management,"Water resources management criteria for its efficient and effective utilization should be well conceived to avoid conflict, reduce negotiation and to increase cooperation. The basic principle of the Indian rivers interlinking was to transfer the surplus water of a basin to water-deficient basin. Nevertheless, the basin/region identified for surplus at present may face severe water scarcity and crisis in future. Therefore, thorough studies of each sub-basin/basins are required to meet the present and projected demands. Interlinking of Rivers (ILR) has emerged for the both intra basin & inter basins water transfer either in space or time. Furthermore, proposal of intra-basin (inter sub-basin) water development should be exercised before inter-basin water transfer and the system can be known as Intra and Inter Linking of Rivers (IILR). The honourable Supreme Court has allowed Centre and concerned states for identifying the feasible links in a speedy manner. In this direction, Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA) and Water Resources Department (WRD), government of Madhya Pradesh (MP) formulated a comprehensive project for basin/sub-basins between Onkeshwar to Narmada Sagar to utilize their water before declaring surplus. The author being short term team leader from consultant (Egis (I) Pvt. Ltd) side conducted initial study. The present paper presents an example of effort towards development of intra-basin schemes and interlinking of sub-basins (i.e. Deb-Goi Rivers in District of Barwani) in the state of MP to protect people’s aspiration at present and their stakes for future, through comprehensive and sustainable studies. © 2016, Scientific Publishers.

Beta diversity and fallow length regulate soil fertility in cocoa agroforestry in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon,"Shifting agriculture (SA), a common practice in tropical areas, involves fallow phases between crop cycles, enabling the recovery of plant communities and soil fertility. However, the reduction of fallow length adversely influences forest structure and topsoil properties. The diversification in tree composition is considered to favour suitable levels of soil fertility in agroforestry systems (AFSs). To test this idea, we investigated whether minimum tree species replacement (β- diversity) between AFSs with reduced fallow length in SA decreases nutrient loss in soils sustaining cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agrosystems. Quantitative analyses revealed that substitution of arboreal species in cocoa AFSs correlated with shifts in soil nutrients. The replacement of fewer arboreal species in AFSs under reduced uncultivated land buffers detrimental effects of intensive land-use on soil productivity. Thus, the dominance of certain tree species is essential to maintain adequate levels of nutrient cycling dynamics with extended fallow length. Similarly, other arboreal species affect soil acidity. In conclusion, the combination AFSs-SA embodies a harmonious farming system that produces food supplies and other goods for human well-being while preserving plant diversity and natural ecological corridors for native flora and fauna. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency
Land use for bioenergy: Synergies and trade-offs between sustainable development goals,"Bioenergy aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contribute to meeting global climate change mitigation targets. Nevertheless, several sustainability concerns are associated with bioenergy, especially related to the impacts of using land for dedicated energy crop production. Cultivating energy crops can result in synergies or trade-offs between GHG emission reductions and other sustainability effects depending on context-specific conditions. Using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, the main synergies and trade-offs associated with land use for dedicated energy crop production were identified. Furthermore, the context-specific conditions (i.e., biomass feedstock, previous land use, climate, soil type and agricultural management) which affect those synergies and trade-offs were also identified. The most recent literature was reviewed and a pairwise comparison between GHG emission reduction (SDG 13) and other SDGs was carried out. A total of 427 observations were classified as either synergy (170), trade-off (176), or no effect (81). Most synergies with environmentally-related SDGs, such as water quality and biodiversity conservation, were observed when perennial crops were produced on arable land, pasture or marginal land in the ‘cool temperate moist’ climate zone and ‘high activity clay’ soils. Most trade-offs were related to food security and water availability. Previous land use and feedstock type are more impactful in determining synergies and trade-offs than climatic zone and soil type. This study highlights the importance of considering context-specific conditions in evaluating synergies and trade-offs and their relevance for developing appropriate policies and practices to meet worldwide demand for bioenergy in a sustainable manner. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental pollution and economic growth: Implications for corporate planning with an Indian case study,"This article attempts to analyze the implications for Corporate planning, in developing societies, of the ecological debate. The emerging nations desperately need growth to raise the base living standards of the vast majority of their populace. Yet, the 'backlash' of the western movement for environmental preservation has spread to the third world. How is the dilemma resolved? Can growth and environmental balance coexist? A distinction must be made between the degradation caused by squalor or lack of growth and that emanating from growth. The spread of the basic amenities of life will reduce the former. The latter can be controlled by planned location and regulation of industrial growth. The corporate planner, therefore, needs to scrutinize the ecological implications of any project carefully before arriving at any value judgement.

An Assessment of Proso Millet as an Alternative Summer Cereal Crop in the Mediterranean Basin,"Proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is a cereal well known for its ability to be successfully grown under drought and intense heat conditions, thus sustaining food security in arid regions. Considering that a trend of increasing drought severity is expected in the future in Southern Europe, solutions need to be found to enhance the resilience of agroecosystems to the effects of climate change. From this perspective, proso millet re-introduction could represent an interesting tool in reducing water consumption for grain production and in providing a new resource to farmers. The aim of this study was to characterize proso millet adaptability to drought and low-input field conditions in the Mediterranean environment, especially considering water-related traits, such as water use efficiency. Limited water-demanding crops and yield stability can contribute to the resilience of agroecosystems and their adaptation to climate change. A three-year field crop experiment was conducted in northern Italy to assess proso millet’s performance in terms of productivity and water status in rainfed agriculture conditions. It was compared to a conventional irrigated corn, a typical summer cereal of the area. All years of experimentation were characterized by adverse meteorological trends, in the full manifestation of the uncertainties of climate change. Despite such different conditions from an agro-meteorological point of view, proso millet showed, in non-irrigated conditions, stable yield and water use efficiency (on average 0.30 kg/m2 and 1.83 kg/m3, respectively), and good agronomic performance. Proso millet, therefore, seems to offer interesting traits for reintroduction on the European side of the Mediterranean Basin, representing a resource for farmers. Moreover, the shortness of the proso millet life cycle (on average 108 days) allows it to be used as a catch crop in the event of major crop failure, an event becoming more likely in the climate change scenario. Furthermore, the possibility of producing grain while saving water (and other production inputs), even in very hot and dry years, increases the sustainability of agricultural production and the resilience of agroecosystems. © 2022 by the authors.

Biofuel as social fuel: Introducing socio-environmental services as a means to reduce global inequity?,"The increasing cultivation of energy crops for biofuel production has significantly altered the focus of the agricultural sector, but the impact of biofuel production and use is not merely an agricultural one. Even more importantly, it is an issue, which likely promotes inequitable conditions and the social conflict of different (basic) needs. Within this context, the dominant argument criticizes the growing demand for biofuels in the north to compromise food security and sovereignty in the south. In order to address these trade-offs and conflicts, the objective of this paper is the introduction of a conceptual framework of socio-environmental services. By expanding the construct of environmental services to explicitly include the social dimension, it shall accommodate for the fact that the provision of environmental services is often embedded in a complex system of global (economic, ecological as well as social) interdependencies. Recently, the concept of payments for environmental services (PES) has received much attention with respect to its potential contribution to both environmental sustainability and the economic alleviation of poverty. By linking the idea of payments for socio-environmental services (PSES) to the three functions of justice, its beneficial impact may be more fully tapped. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Cuba: Plenty of care, few condoms, no corruption","The health system in Cuba guarantees accessibility to the entire population, is free of charge, and covers the spectrum from vaccinations to sophisticated interventions. The results are impressive: Cuba's health figures are on a par with developed countries that have 20 times the budget. The country is experiencing a difficult period because of the collapse and loss of support from the Soviet Union; over 30 years' trade embargo by the United States; and the gradual change from a centrally planned economy towards more of a free market system. Shortages are experienced in every sector, and maintaining health care services at the current level is too expensive. Doctors and nurses continue to work towards the goal of health for all Cubans, even though their salaries are minimal. Signs of negligence or corruption, often seen in other socialist countries where incentives for output are lacking, are unknown. Topics such as family planning and AIDS deserve immediate attention.; The health system in Cuba guarantees accessibility to the entire population, and it is free of charge. Cuba's health figures are on a par with developed countries that have 20 times the budget. Each year around 4000 students start their medical training at 23 different universities. Since 1980 there has been a training course for family doctors. By 1995 22,000 of them have been trained covering 90% of the population. Their main work is preventive: health promotion and offering basic curative care. The family doctors are backed up by 400 polyclinics, where specialists offer their services to about 30,000 people. Life expectancy is 77 years and infant mortality a mere 9 per 1000 live births. Malaria has been eradicated and dengue fever successfully reduced. Leading causes of mortality are cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, accidents, and homicides. Up to now only 1089 people have been diagnosed as HIV positive. From a mere epidemiological point of view, strict isolation could contain the epidemic in a closed society. In practice, however, the island opened the doors to tourism, with a side effect of increasing prostitution. Condoms or any contraceptives are in short supply. Nevertheless, the number of abortions is low, less than 1 per 100 deliveries. The reason is that all women whose expected menstruation is late by two weeks are offered a microaspiration in the polyclinic. 700 regulations are performed for every 5000 fertile women. Pregnancy tests are not performed as they are not available. The country is experiencing a difficult period because of the collapse and loss of support from the Soviet Union; over 30 years' trade embargo by the United States and the gradual change from a centrally planned economy towards more of a free market system.

Influence of Irrigation Methods and Nano-fertilizers Application on the Yield of Transplanted Lowland Rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Periyar Vaigai Command Area of Madurai,"Background: Rice production and productivity must be increased despite water scarcity and deterioration of soil fertility by imbalanced fertilizer application. To meet the demand of the ever growing population, the production level must be increased to cope with minimum inputs and enhanced input-use efficiency. Efficient and effective method of irrigation and f ertilizer application could address the emerging issue. Methods: The field study was conducted at the Agricultural College and Research Institute in Madurai to identify suitable irrigation methods and nutrient management practices with the aim of increasing the yield of rice under transplanted condition during Kharif 2022. The experiment was carried out in a split plot design with irrigation methods in the main plot and foliar spray of nano-fertilizers in combination with conventional fertilizers in the sub-plot. Result: Yield characters such as number of productive tillers m-2, panicle length (cm), panicle weight (g), number of grains and filled grains panicle-1 were recorded in addition to grain and straw yield (kg/ha). From this study it could be concluded that, irrigation through alternate wetting and drying along with combined application of 50% N and K through straight fertilizers + Nano N and K applied as foliar spray recorded higher yield attributes and yield of rice. © 2024, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

Reasons for challenges with food security in India,"The challenges of food security in India have long been a major source of worry for the governing body, particularly during a pandemic. The main causes are the following: poor administration of nutrition programs, poverty, corruption, climate change, unemployment, lack of awareness, growing population, soil degradation, and inadequate technology for managing food storage. India's standing in the 121-nation Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 fell to 107th place. Hunger is rated as ""serious,"" with a score of 27.50. India dropped six positions overall from the GHI ranking for 2021. Despite having one of the highest agriculture outputs globally, India has one of the worst rates of under nutrition due to a significant portion of its people have been estimated to be residing in impoverished conditions. Our current study used databases like Global Health, SCOPUS, ProQuest, and Web of Science to analyze family food intake and expenditures at the household level in India during the pandemic to determine overall food security. Food production has been hampered by the pandemic's lockdown since many farmers put off planting their crops for fear of violating the curfew. Given that the balance between food distribution in urban and rural areas has changed, there is an inadequate distribution of food. Officials from the health department must take the initiative to check the execution of various projects. To assess the success of the program's implementation, they should all be armed with the most recent information. Additionally, decentralized food banks might be established in rural areas to combat corruption. Implementing better farming practices, increasing irrigation, distributing cultivable land and farm size, offering higher-quality seeds, and providing fertilizers contribute to boosting agricultural productivity. Education about general hygiene, sanitation, and nutrition should also be prioritized. To solve this problem, additional involvement from the stakeholders, including village organizations, private institutions, NGOs, community participation, and intersectional coordination, is very much needed. © 2024 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Protected Areas and Food Security: Unravelling the Issues,"Recent research has highlighted the contributions of forests and tree-based systems to both dietary diversity and nutrition as well as agricultural production in the form of tree-based ecosystem services. Wild foods provide a significant nutritional contribution to the diets of rural dwellers, the majority of whom would be classified as some of the world’s poorest. In addition, it is now known that agricultural systems in the proximity of natural forest formations can exhibit greater productivity in terms of both yield and resilience to environmental shocks, as well as higher nutritional values. Yet, despite the important human-forest interactions and relative degrees of forest dependency, access to much of the global forest estate is increasingly regulated under the guise of biodiversity conservation. How this restricted access plays out when the ‘right to food’ is a deeply enshrined human right has been deeply contested.

Unemployment and macroeconomics,"This chapter is an attempt to review the existing literature and raise questions about the appropriateness of the way that employment policies are set. The current macroeconomic and labor policy is built on the adoption of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU). This simplifies the relation between unemployment and inflation, and determines the long-run equilibrium level of unemployment at which there is neither upward nor downward inflation pressures, while any unemployment level below the predetermined NAIRU level itself should be followed by inflation reductions and vice versa. The recognition of NAIRU as the guide for policy decision and its concentration on inflation targeting, is believed to have significantly affect in the shaping the broader macroeconomic conditions, within which the spectacular macroeconomic imbalanced could build up and eventually lead to collapse of economies and the presence of current economic crisis. As a result, the interest in this concept has been resurgent, indicating the need for a basic evaluation of its origins and a brief explanation of some of the claims surrounding it. This study focuses on the Phillips curve and its rearrangements, discusses the views of the NAIRU concept, evaluates that the necessity that arises from empirical evidence, concerns the appropriateness of mix labor market institutions and laws that will actually protect employment, and concludes that attention should be paid on the unemployment level itself and income inequalities in order economic growth to be raised. Actually, the dynamic economic system can be only balanced by achieving its general reconstruction, which should be represented on the adoption of a full employment target and the regulation of the financial sector in the sense that this sector affects essentially economic process. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Governing energy while neglecting health – The case of Poland,"The present article discusses Poland's continued reliance on coal power and the consequent impacts on public health. Concrete aspects of the energy infrastructure and political priorities are shown to compromise as compromising public governance and leading to deteriorated health standards among the general population. To make this case, this study juxtaposes the most recent developments in the Polish energy sector with current measures in EU energy policy and reforms in other EU Member States. Special attention is paid to developments in Poland following the political shift in October 2015, when a new government came to power. The ruling conservative party's direct involvement in the management of the mining and utility companies and its strong political ties to miners’ unions are particularly discussed. Theoretically, the article relies on the TAPIC framework for governance. The framework rests on five integral principles of good governance: Transparency, Accountability, Participation, Integrity and Capacity; TAPIC allows scholars to study the impact of governance on public health in any policy area. Methodologically, this study relies on secondary sources, including academic publications, national and international reports, and statistical data on a range of energy and health factors in Poland and Europe. © 2017 The Author",Not About Sufficiency
"Longevity, Fertility and Economic Growth: Do Environmental Factors Matter?","Our study examines the effect of environmental factors on the economic decisions regarding fertility. We incorporate health-damaging pollution into a three period overlapping generations model in which life expectancy, fertility and economic growth are all endogenous. We show that environmental factors can cause significant changes to the economy's demographics. In particular, the entrepreneurial choice of less polluting production processes, induced by a tax on emissions, can at some point in time lead to such changes as higher longevity and lower fertility rates. Thus, we provide a novel explanation on the positive relation between fertility rates and pollution. According to this, the causality on this relation may also work from the latter to the former. Furthermore, our model can account for the empirically observed N-shaped correlation between pollution and income per capita. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Near real-time soil erosion mapping through mobile gamma-ray spectroscopy,"Soil erosion has been associated with various negative environmental impacts foremost of which is the potential pressure it could impose on global food security. The poor conditions of our agricultural soil can be attributed to years of unsustainable farming practices occurring throughout history that has placed significant pressure on the environment. Moreover, climate change scenarios indicate further intensification which is likely making prediction and assessment of erosion processes critical for long term agricultural sustainability. This study demonstrates the potential of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry with large volume NaI(Tl) detectors to identify, at high spatial resolution, changes in 137Cs soil concentration within the ploughed layer of soil and enabling the soil erosion processes to be quantified. This technique represents a significant advantage over conventional spatially-isolated point measurements such as soil sampling as it offers real time mapping at the field scale. However, spectral signal derived from measurements in the field are highly dependent on the calibration procedure used and are particularly sensitive to source-detector changes such as the presence of a vehicle, ground curvature and soil moisture content. Conventional calibration procedures tend to not consider these potential sources of uncertainty potentially leaving the system vulnerable to systematic uncertainties, especially when 137Cs concentrations are low. This study used Monte Carlo simulations to investigate such changes utilising additional information including a high-resolution digital terrain model. The method was demonstrated on a ploughed site in Scotland, revealing a mixture of tillage and water erosion patterns supported by soil core data. Findings showed that the sites topography had relatively little effect (<10%) on calculated erosion rates, but moisture content could be the determining factor, albeit very difficult to measure reliably throughout a survey. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Public discourses on conservation and development in a rural community in Colombia: an application of Q-methodology,"People living in rural areas are caught between the two often conflicting objectives of conserving biodiversity and promoting economic development. Current approaches to conservation are built on the premise that conservation and development are not antagonistic. Social conservationists advocate win–win solutions that both conserve biodiversity and promote human well-being. In this paper we explore how the conservation-development relationship is understood by a rural community in Colombia where remaining areas of tropical dry forest are threatened by human activities, and a payment for ecosystem services scheme, PES, is proposed as a conservation strategy. Q-methodology was used to identify and categorise local peoples’ perspectives on forest conservation. Four distinctive perspectives were found: Social Conservationism, Fair Development, Development Advocate and Government’s Responsibility. Social conservationism places more importance on forest conservation while the other three perspectives emphasise development. This suggests that the conservation program at the local level must be explicit about tensions and trade-offs. Not to do so can compromise the social acceptability of the PES scheme and therefore the conservation objective. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Promoting universal financial protection: A policy analysis of universal health coverage in Costa Rica (1940-2000),"Background: This paper explores the implementation and sustenance of universal health coverage (UHC) in Costa Rica, discussing the development of a social security scheme that covered 5% of the population in 1940, to one that finances and provides comprehensive healthcare to the whole population today. The scheme is financed by mandatory, tri-partite social insurance contributions complemented by tax funding to cover the poor. Methods: The analysis takes a historical perspective and explores the policy process including the key actors and their relative influence in decision-making. Data were collected using qualitative research instruments, including a review of literature, institutional and other documents, and in-depth interviews with key informants. Results: Key lessons to be learned are: i) population health was high on the political agenda in Costa Rica, in particular before the 1980s when UHC was enacted and the transfer of hospitals to the social security institution took place. Opposition to UHC could therefore be contained through negotiation and implemented incrementally despite the absence of real consensus among the policy elite; ii) since the 1960s, the social security institution has been responsible for UHC in Costa Rica. This institution enjoys financial and managerial autonomy relative to the general government, which has also facilitated the UHC policy implementation process; iii) UHC was simultaneously constructed on three pillars that reciprocally strengthened each other: increasing population coverage, increasing availability of financial resources based on solidarity financing mechanisms, and increasing service coverage, ultimately offering comprehensive health services and the same benefits to every resident in the country; iv) particularly before the 1980s, the fruits of economic growth were structurally invested in health and other universal social policies, in particular education and sanitation. The social security institution became a flagship of Costa Rica's national development strategy which reinforced its political importance and contributed to its longer-term sustainability and that of UHC. Conclusions: UHC has been achieved in Costa Rica because it was supported at the highest political level within a favourable socio-economic and political context. Once achieved, UHC became an entitlement for the population and now enjoys broad public support. © 2013 World Health Organization; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Adaptive management and water security in a global context: definitions, concepts, and examples","Conventional water governance that centralizes decision-making and focuses on increasing supply has sometimes led to ecological degradation and inequitable outcomes. As a corrective, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) incorporates sustainability principles that integrate social, ecological, and infrastructural systems. However, this governance mode still does not address complex issues for an uncertain future, and fails to offer a clear goal. Adaptive management, another approach, relies on public participation and active knowledge exchange between scientists and policy-makers; it also incorporates uncertainty into decision-making. The concept of water security emerged subsequently to address the lack of a clear goal for water management. In this paper, we set into context the terms ‘adaptive management’ and ‘water security’ and review their evolution and their critiques. Both concepts require measurement and monitoring of outcomes in order to determine progress toward established goals so as to guide decision-making. We discuss the challenges and different ways of measuring water security and offer a representative list of potential indicators. The essay provides some examples of adaptive-management studies across the world and discusses adaptive management as it relates to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our concluding remarks reflect on present challenges, practical limitations, and promising ideas for a future type of water governance that is participatory, equitable, and adaptive. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable management of animal genetic resources to improve low-input livestock production: Insights into local beninese cattle populations,"Persistent food insecurity, along with climate change pressures, urges on the definition of suitable strategies to support the transformation of low-input livestock farming in developing coun-tries. Advances in genomics and information technologies are valuable opportunities for achieving the required improvement, but their implementation implies access to technical and financial resources with appropriate adjustment in the local context. Addressing extensive cattle production in Benin, we focus on animal genetic resources (AnGR) and corresponding approaches aiming for a durable breeding improvement based on sustainable management strategies. Specifically, small-holder breeding goals are revised, and novel strategies for proper organization, sound data collec-tion, and scientific investigations are explored. Further emphasis addresses the enhancement of farmer management practices, including valuable traditional knowledge; and breeding strategies to improve animal performances considering robustness and further traits favored by the farmers. Against such a background, it is imperative that political, institutional, and scientific collaborations reinforce research capacities and technical and financial resources.

Impact of derived global weather data on simulated crop yields,"Crop simulation models can be used to estimate impact of current and future climates on crop yields and food security, but require long-term historical daily weather data to obtain robust simulations. In many regions where crops are grown, daily weather data are not available. Alternatively, gridded weather databases (GWD) with complete terrestrial coverage are available, typically derived from: (i) global circulation computer models; (ii) interpolated weather station data; or (iii) remotely sensed surface data from satellites. The present study's objective is to evaluate capacity of GWDs to simulate crop yield potential (Yp) or water-limited yield potential (Yw), which can serve as benchmarks to assess impact of climate change scenarios on crop productivity and land use change. Three GWDs (CRU, NCEP/DOE, and NASA POWER data) were evaluated for their ability to simulate Yp and Yw of rice in China, USA maize, and wheat in Germany. Simulations of Yp and Yw based on recorded daily data from well-maintained weather stations were taken as the control weather data (CWD). Agreement between simulations of Yp or Yw based on CWD and those based on GWD was poor with the latter having strong bias and large root mean square errors (RMSEs) that were 26-72% of absolute mean yield across locations and years. In contrast, simulated Yp or Yw using observed daily weather data from stations in the NOAA database combined with solar radiation from the NASA-POWER database were in much better agreement with Yp and Yw simulated with CWD (i.e. little bias and an RMSE of 12-19% of the absolute mean). We conclude that results from studies that rely on GWD to simulate agricultural productivity in current and future climates are highly uncertain. An alternative approach would impose a climate scenario on location-specific observed daily weather databases combined with an appropriate upscaling method. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Achievements, Difficulties and Challenges of Managing and Adapting to Drought and Saltwater Intrusion in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta","The Vietnamese Mekong Delta is a fairly flat area with a low average elevation relative to the mean sea level. It is dissected by the Tien and Hau Rivers, two main tributaries of the Mekong River and has a dense network of natural rivers and canals connecting to the sea. It is the largest center of agricultural production and aquaculture in Vietnam and plays a particular role in ensuring food security and economic development of the country, providing rice, vegetables, fruits and aquatic products not only for the country but also for export. In recent years, climate change and extreme climatic events like drought and severe saltwater intrusion have seriously affected the lives and agricultural cultivation of people in the region. Local people have taken many adaptation measures, such as changing the planting schedule to avoid drought and salinity, while the Government has built large saline prevention sluices in some provinces to control saltwater intrusion at a regional level. These measures have had some success. However, there are still many difficulties and challenges for the future. This paper discusses how people in this region adapt to drought and saltwater intrusion in agricultural and aquaculturral farming systems, the solutions issued by the Government to deal with drought and saltwater intrusion, the results achieved, and the difficulties and challenges that are still faced. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Mercury contamination associated with small-scale gold mining in Tanzania and Zimbabwe,"Mercury contamination associated with small-scale gold mining and processing represents a major environmental and human health concern in Eastern and Southern Africa. Approximately 200 000-300 000 persons are involved in small-scale gold mining activities in Tanzania and > 200000 persons in Zimbabwe. Mercury (Hg) is used mainly for the processing of primary gold quartz veins and supergene gold mineralizations. Gravimetric material flow analyses show that 70-80% of the Hg is lost to the atmosphere during processing, 20-30% are lost to tailings, soils, stream sediments and water. For every 1 g Au produced, 1.2-1.5 g Hg are lost to the environment. Cumulatively, the anthropogenic Hg released annually into the atmosphere is approximately 3-4 t in the whole Lake Victoria Goldfields of Tanzania and > 3 t in Zimbabwe. Tailings are local 'hot spots' with high concentrations of As, Pb, Cu and Hg. Lateral and vertical dispersion of Hg lost to soils and stream sediments is very limited (laterally <260 m, vertically <20 cm). Dispersion of mercury from tailings is low because Hg is transported largely in the elemental, metallic form. In addition, Fe-oxide rich laterites and swamps appear to be natural barriers for the dispersion of metals in soils and streams. Ground and surface water quality data indicate very low dispersion rates during the dry season. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Resolving Conservation Conflicts through Shared Vision, Collective Benefits and Relevant Values","The global challenges of biodiversity loss and persistent poverty and inequality, which interact and shape each other at the local scale, require new strategies to improve human well-being and conserve biodiversity. In South Africa, inclusive and transformative conservation approaches are gaining support, which is of particular importance given the challenging history of conservation during the colonial and apartheid eras. The Dinokeng Game Reserve was created to conserve biodiversity and combat poverty in adjacent communities. However, human–elephant conflict and community development challenges have led to unproductive conservation trade-offs. We developed a Theory of Change for Living in Harmony that can help policymakers, conservation organisations and local communities to find better solutions. To develop the Theory of Change, we assessed the visions and perspectives towards (elephant) conservation and socio-economic development among both people living inside (owners/direct beneficiaries) and outside (community/indirect beneficiaries) the reserve. The study revealed common ground among stakeholder groups in ranking elephant benefits, as well as a collective acknowledgement of the importance of moral values in conservation decision making. However, the benefits of living within or adjacent to an elephant reserve differed considerably across stakeholder groups. Accordingly, different but not mutually exclusive solutions were suggested, including investments in multi-level good governance, education and capacity building, active community engagement and development, reserve expansion, and promoting the reserve’s integrated conservation model. This Theory of Change aims to support common ground between stakeholders, with critical feedback loops that reduce barriers and enable conditions for coexistence. It promotes conservation strategies that are socially relevant and widely supported, can create mutually beneficial outcomes for elephants, biodiversity, and multiple stakeholders, and can be applied to other species or ecosystems in general, with specific elements being tailored to those circumstances. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The economics of ecosystem services and poverty,"Introduction: Ecosystems play a crucial role in the survival and well-being of human beings. Increasing pressure on ecosystems resulting from economic development and population growth has resulted in degrading ecosystems and losses of the services ecosystems provide throughout the world. According to the UN (2010) ‘as a consequence of human actions, species are being lost at a rate estimated to be 100 times the natural rate of extinction. In the past century, 35% of the mangroves, 40% of the forests and 50% of the wetlands have been lost … action is urgently needed to avoid reaching critical thresholds that will lead to an irreversible loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, with dangerous consequences for human well-being’. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) (2005) was the first to explicitly underline the linkages between ecosystems and human well-being, coining the term ‘ecosystem services’ to stress the important benefits that people derive from ecosystems (MEA 2005). The term ‘Ecosystem Services’ serves as a catalyst to stress the importance of ecosystems for human well-being. As indicated in Figure 1.1, the number of publications using the term has increased exponentially since 2005. Figure 1.1 also shows that most of the publications are in the domain of the natural sciences, with the governance-based sciences somewhat lagging behind. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",Not About Sufficiency
Introduction,"Since 1989, the countries of the former Soviet Union have undertaken a new rural revolution. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ruled a single, centralized, state when that transformation began. The political tensions exposed and heightened by the agrarian reforms greatly contributed to the collapse of the Soviet empire in August 1991. To make post-Soviet agriculture work more efficiently and provide a steady supply of the food and agricultural raw materials needed for further economic growth and development, individual farmers and farm workers must be given new incentives. The Soviet countryside was collectivized longer and more thoroughly than anywhere else. Financial aid is surely necessary. But without socio-economic changes that aid will be just as wasted as the vast sums the old USSR authorities appropriated for agriculture between 1965 and 1991. © 1993 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Studying the economic and environmental effects of selected irrigated agricultural enterprises in Iran,"It is hard to argue that water scarcity has become an important issue in the world. The figures in all over the world indicate that agriculture sector has a large share in water consumption. Due to drought seasons in recent years, irrigated agriculture has increased significantly and the depletion of underground aquifers has become serious issue. In this study the environmental performance index (EPI) was applied to measure the economic and environmental performance of main irrigated agricultural enterprises in Iran. The EPI index was computed using data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques. The results indicated that the environmental effects of irrigated enterprises vary significantly among enterprises and across the years of study. The results showed that wheat has the most EPI score among enterprises of study that this indicates least environmental effects and high economic return and walnut has the least EPI score that this indicates greater environmental effects and low economic return.",Not About Sufficiency
"Land cover, land use changes and air pollution in Asia: A synthesis","A better understanding of land cover/land use changes (LCLUC) and their interactions with the atmospheric environment is essential for the sustainable management of natural resources, environmental protection, air quality, agricultural planning and food security. The 15 papers published in this focus issue showcase a variety of studies relating to drivers and impacts of LCLUC and air pollution in different South/Southeast Asian (S/SEA) countries. This synthesis article, in addition to giving context to the articles in this focus issue, also reviews the broad linkages between population, LCLUC and air pollution. Additionally, we identify knowledge gaps and research priorities that are essential in addressing air pollution issues in the region. We conclude that for effective pollution mitigation in S/SEA countries, quantifying drivers, sources and impacts of pollution need a thorough data analysis through ground-based instrumentation, models and integrated research approaches. We also stress the need for the development of sustainable technologies and strengthening the scientific and resource management communities through capacity building and training activities to address air pollution issues in S/SEA countries. © 2017 The Author(s).

WEEE treatment in developing countries: Environmental pollution and health consequences—An overview,"In the last few decades, the rapid technological evolution has led to a growing generation of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Not rarely, it has been exported from industrialized to developing countries, where it represents a secondary source of valuable materials such as gold, copper, and silver. The recycling of WEEE is often carried out without any environmental and health protection. This paper reviews recent literature dealing with the informal treatment of WEEE in developing regions, gathering and analyzing data on concentration of both inorganic and organic pollutants in the environment. Open burning practices are revealed as most polluting ‘technology’, followed by mechanical treatment and leaching. Significant levels of pollutants have been detected in human bodies, both children and adults, working in or living in areas with informal WEEE treatment. © 2019 by the authors.

Labour’s Hidden soul: Religion at the intersection of labour and the environment,"This study examines the intersection of individual life-histories, organisational histories and societal histories and reveals how religion, in several different expressions, serves to provide a connection between justice for workers and justice for the environment in the work of trade unionists. The trade union movement is generally seen as secular, and thus in our life-history interviews finding religion as a backdrop to labour activists’ formation was unexpected. Religion becomes manifest in various ways, partly through experiences in the present or at formative periods in unionists’ lives, but also through its cultural embeddedness in language and collective memory. In this way it serves to provide subtle influences on beliefs, concepts of social justice and daily action. © 2019 The White Horse Press.",Not About Sufficiency
HSP90AB1 Variations in Four Cattle Breeds Raised in Türkiye,"Cattle play an essential role in ensuring global food security, yet they are encountering growing challenges from climate change. In Türkiye, cattle rearing is a fundamental aspect of agriculture, and native breeds are particularly important, even as their numbers dwindle. Understanding the genetic makeup of these breeds, especially their heat tolerance, is of great importance for sustainable livestock production. This study focused on identifying polymorphisms in the HSP90AB1 gene associated with heat tolerance in 122 cattle raised in Türkiye (Anatolian Black-AB, East Anatolian Red-EAR, Turkish Grey Steppe-TGS, and cosmopolitan Holstein Friesian-HF). The samples were respectively obtained from village herds in Antalya, Erzurum, Balıkesir, and Erzurum provinces for AB, TGS, EAR, and HF breeds. Blood samples were collected from different populations and genotyping was performed using Allele-Specific PCR. Regarding the HSP90AB1 gene, polymorphism was observed in the populations, with two alleles (C and G) and three genotypes (CC, CT, and TT), while the CC allele was not observed in TGS cattle. The frequency of the T allele was higher than that of the C allele in the studied cattle population. The TT genotype frequency ranged from 0.12 (HF) to 0.38 (TGS), while the lowest (0.00) and highest (0.35) CC frequencies were observed in TGS and HF, respectively. Significant deviation (p<0.05) from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) was detected in the EAR and TGS cattle breeds with respect to the HSP90AB1 gene. As climate change intensifies environmental stresses, the adoption of molecular genetics and Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) is necessary for the conservation of native genetic resources and the establishment of resilient livestock populations in Türkiye’s changing climate environment. © 2024, Centenary University.

The role of income inequality in shaping fishing ground footprint in Indonesia: Insights from the fourier augmented ARDL approach,"While many studies examine the determinants of ecological footprint, evidence regarding the determinants of fishing ground footprint is quite limited. These limited studies focus on traditional economic factors, examining the determinants of fishing ground footprint. This study represents the first theoretical and empirical investigation linking income inequality to fishing ground footprint. The aim is to explore the influence of income inequality on fishing grounds footprint in Indonesia from 1980 to 2022. The study employs the Fourier Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag method, which robustly captures both long-term dynamics while accounting for structural breaks in the data. This method offers more reliable results than traditional methods. The analysis also incorporates economic factors such as financial development, economic growth, energy consumption, trade openness, and urbanization. The key finding reveals that income inequality increases the fishing ground footprint, indicating a positive nexus between income inequality and the fishing ground footprint in Indonesia. Additionally, financial development, economic growth, and urbanization enhance the fishing ground footprint, while energy consumption and trade openness have no significant effects. The results provide important insights for policymakers, highlighting the nexus between sustainable development goals and suggesting that Indonesia can simultaneously reduce inequality and fishing ground footprint. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluation of outstanding theories in outsourcing with practices in the public health sector: The case of Türkiye,"Outsourcing is an essential tool in supply management.

Governing Commercial Agriculture in Africa: The Challenges of Coordinating Investments and Selecting Investors,"While the discussion about Africa's future agricultural development has focused mainly on the role of small farms, increased investor interest suggests that there could be real potential in larger scale commercial investments in the Continent. A key question is what policies and institutions are necessary to enable countries to get the most out of these investments in terms of economic development and food security. This chapter focuses on how private investors and governments in Africa can work with each other to overcome bottlenecks in commercial agriculture. It discusses mechanisms to coordinate interdependent private and public investments, especially in infrastructure, select investors well, and mitigate the social risks associated with the change in land governance. It also explores ideas for collective governance mechanisms beyond government. Infusing the literature on agricultural development with that of industrial organization and policy and natural resource management leads one to view agriculture as a set of small and large farms that need an enabling policy and institutional environment to increase productivity and shared economic growth. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Are air pollution, economic and non-economic factors associated with per capita health expenditures? Evidence from emerging economies","Environmental pollution, rapid economic growth, and other social factors have adverse effects on public health, which have consequently increased the burden of health expenditures during the last two decades. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the environment index, as well as economic and non-economic factors such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, foreign direct investment, population aging, and secondary education impacts on per capita government and private health expenditures in 13 emerging economies for the time period of 1994–2017. We employ robust econometric techniques in this endeavor of panel data analysis to account for the issues of heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. This study applies the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) bootstrap approach to investigate the presence of panel cointegration and empirical results underscore the existence of cointegration among variables. For the execution of long-run analysis, we incorporate the two latest estimators, i.e., continuously updated-fully modified (CUP-FM) and continuously updated- bias corrected (CUP-BC). Findings of long-run elasticities have documented that the air-pollution indicators, i.e., CO2 emissions and the environment index, have a positive and significant influence on government health expenditures, while in contrast, both factors negatively influence private health expenditures in emerging economies. We find that economic factors such as GDP growth consistently show a positive impact on both government and private health expenditures, whereas, foreign direct investment exhibits a significant negative and positive impact on government and private health expenditures respectively. Findings of non-economic factors can be used to argue that population aging increases health expenditures while secondary education lowers private health spending in emerging markets. Furthermore, empirical analysis of heterogeneous causality indicates that CO2 emissions, the environment index, GDP growth, foreign direct investment, and secondary education have a unidirectional causal relationship with government and private health expenditures. Population aging has a strong relationship of bidirectional causality with government health expenditures and unidirectional causal relationship with private health expenditures. Findings of this paper put forward key suggestions for policy makers which can be used as valuable instruments for better understanding and aiming to maximize public healthcare and environmental quality gains which are highly connected with sustainable GDP growth and developments in emerging economies. © 2019 by the authors.

Valuing stakeholder preferences for environmental benefits of stormwater ponds: Evidence from choice experiment,"With population growth driving urban expansion in many cities in the United States, there is a need for a sustainable way to manage stormwater. Green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) is considered an innovative way to handle stormwater because of its potential to provide multiple ecosystem services (ES) beyond flooding reduction. However, there is limited research regarding the society's perceived value for GSI practices' co-benefits. This study utilized stated-preference data obtained from a choice experiment in an online survey of 1159 South Carolina (SC) residents to estimate a monetary value for the ES provided by wet detention ponds— the most widely adopted stormwater practice in coastal counties of SC. The benefits examined are flooding reduction, water quality, wildlife habitat, recreation, and scenic beauty. The data were analyzed using a Mixed logit formulation. Considering the differences across the state, the model was estimated separately for five counties. Findings indicate that residents are willing to pay $13.8 to $37.8 annually for a 50% improvement in pollutant removal efficiency of ponds in addition to their current stormwater fee. Also, they are willing to pay $12.5 to $42.9 per year for the nearest pond to have buffer vegetation and wildlife. They are also likely to pay $5 to $22.5 for ponds to contribute to their neighborhood's scenic beauty. Furthermore, the results indicate that respondents from three counties are willing to pay $5.4 to $13.2 for a 50% improvement in flooding reduction, while those from two counties are likely to pay $3.9 to $4.9 for ponds to have recreational benefits. The findings of the study could help stormwater managers in designing their stormwater management programs, especially for better evaluation of stormwater utility fees. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
Land-use intensification and environmental degradation: Empirical evidence from irrigated and rain-fed farms in south eastern Nigeria,"When evaluating the potential of irrigation for agricultural production one must consider more than the technical and financial potential and feasibility of the scheme. Issues of environmental and social sustainability must also be considered. The purpose of the paper is to develop a framework for assessing the sustainability of an irrigation scheme and apply it in the context of one such scheme in south eastern Nigeria. The framework for assessment is based on a comparison of differential changes in environmental quality with and without the scheme, and before and after the scheme. The author does this by using measured soil characteristics for irrigated and adjacent rain-fed plots of agricultural land; and socio-economic analysis of other environmental and social impacts of the irrigation scheme. Data were collected through a field survey of the selected irrigated and rain-fed farm plots, qualitative interviews with the farm owners and relevant secondary sources. The analyses find that the soils of the irrigated farms have been significantly degraded more than those of the rain-fed farms to the extent that precludes sustainable practice of arable agriculture on irrigated land in the study area. About 9% of the soils of the irrigated land have been degraded to the extent that they are no longer suitable for arable agriculture. Analyses of the qualitative interviews also find other bio-physical, social and economic impacts that significantly constrain long-term sustainability of arable agriculture in the study area. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Diversity of use and local knowledge of wild edible plant resources in Nepal,"Background: Wild edible plants (WEP) provide staple and supplement foods, as well as cash income to local communities, thus favouring food security. However, WEP are largely ignored in land use planning and implementation, economic development, and biodiversity conservation. Moreover, WEP-related traditional knowledge is rapidly eroding. Therefore, we designed this study to fulfill a part of the knowledge gap by providing data on diversity, traditional knowledge, economic potential, and conservation value of WEP from Nepal.Methods: The information was collected through focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Percentage of general utility of the plants among the study communities was evaluated using the Chi-square (χ2) test of homogeneity. High priority species were identified after consultation with the local stakeholders followed by scoring based on defined criteria. Pairwise ranking was used to assess ethnoecological knowledge to identify the threats to WEP.Results: We documented 81 species belonging to Angiosperms (74), Pteridophytes (5), and Fungi (2). Most of the species were used as fruits (44 species) followed by vegetables (36). Almost half of the species (47%) were also used for purposes other than food. From the species with market value (37% of the total), 10 were identified as high priority species. Pairwise ranking revealed that WEP are threatened mostly by habitat destruction, land-use change and over-harvesting. Some of these plants are crop wild relatives and could thus be used for crop improvement. Interestingly, our study also revealed that young people who spend most of the time in the forest as herdsmen are particularly knowledgeable of wild fruit plants.Conclusion: We provide empirical evidence from a relatively large area of Nepal about diversity and status of WEP, as well as methodological insights about the proper knowledge holders to consult. Regarding the unique and important knowledge they have on WEP, young people should be included when recruiting participants to ethnobotanical studies or to any type of consultation about WEP. The habit of using wild edible plants is still alive and is a traditional culinary practice that demonstrates rich traditional knowledge of local people. WEP were found to be important for livelihood as well as showing great potential for crop improvement. Priority species should be promoted for income generation activities through sustainable collection and trade. Communities should engage in minimizing the threats to these valuable resources. © 2012 Uprety et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards (Global) Food Equity – The Role of Intellectual Property and Trade,"The Covid-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted global food systems, aggravating vulnerabilities in consumption, production, hygiene, and access. These disruptions intensified economic instability and reduced the production capacity of small and medium-sized agribusinesses, widening the gap between food supply and demand and contributing to a dramatic rise in global undernourishment. Economic fallout and price inflation compounded these issues, particularly affecting low-income countries and exacerbating social inequities. The recent escalation in global food crises, exacerbated by events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and climate change, underscores the urgent need for a transformative approach to food ecosystems. This article examines the critical role of intellectual property (IP) and trade in fostering equitable food governance, particularly within the post-pandemic and post-crisis global legal order. It assesses how IP and trade mechanisms might bridge gaps in food security and advance the right to food as part of a broader human rights framework. Using equity as a guiding concept, this article analyzes ongoing initiatives at the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization, focusing on recent developments in trade negotiations and the International Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Traditional Knowledge. Through these lenses, the article evaluates the potential of IP and trade instruments to support sustainable, inclusive, and equitable food governance, highlighting how these tools can address emerging challenges in agri-food innovation, food sovereignty, and climate resilience. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Navigating Biomass Trade-Offs: Earmarking Sustainable Food Security Through Biochar Interventions in Mung Bean Cultivars Under High Ozone Atmosphere,"The rapid increase in tropospheric ozone levels, exceeding the phytotoxic threshold (40 ppb), threatens crop yields in India's Indo-Gangetic plains, necessitating the exploration of antiozonants. Biochar application offers a promising, low-risk solution to mitigate the harmful effects of ozone and other abiotic stressors on agriculture. This study investigates the ameliorative effects of biochar amendments (2.5 and 5%) on selected mung bean cultivars (HUM-1 and HUM-6) under elevated ozone (ambient + 20 ppb). Biochar amendments improved foliar characteristics and reduced chlorotic and necrotic spots generated by elevated ozone. Reductions led by ozone in the growth and root-shoot ratio were significantly mitigated in biochar-treated plants. Despite decreased nodulation, the size and biomass of individual nodules increased under biochar treatments. Under ozone stress, the HUM-1 cultivar allocated more photosynthetic assimilates to vegetative parts of the plant, whereas, the HUM-6 cultivar directed greater photosynthates to reproductive structures. Floral and fruit characteristics improved in both cultivars after biochar supplementation, indicating enhanced carbon allocation towards reproductive parts. Biochar treatments also alleviated seed shriveling and size reduction observed under ozone stress, improving seed quality. Biochar amendment was more beneficial in yield protection of sensitive cultivar (HUM-1) than less sensitive cultivar (HUM-6). Findings of the present study suggested that biochar applications of 2.5% and 5% have significant potential to mitigate the adverse impact of ozone on mung bean plants. This study underscores the potential of biochar as a viable agronomic intervention to enhance crop resilience against tropospheric ozone, contributing to food security and sustainable agriculture in the context of climate change. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
"Climatic variability and its impact on the indigenous agricultural system using panel data analysis in the Sikkim Himalaya, India","Climate-induced extreme events with fluctuations in climatic indicators like temperature and precipitation highly influence crop productivity. This study deals with quantitative analysis of climatic variability and crop production (1990–2018) using panel data regression analysis. The focus is on variability of three crops, i.e., paddy, maize, and wheat in the Rangit river basin of Sikkim Himalaya, India. Meterological data were acquired from the Indian Meteorological Department, agricultural data from the state agricultural department and a field survey were also conducted with the farmers, using a structured questionnaire, focused group discussion, and key informant observations. The acquired data was analyzed with the help of correlation and multiple linear regression analysis to analyze the relationship between climatic variability and crop production. The result of the study shows that all three crops are dependent on rainfall; however, paddy was the most sensitive to climatic variability. It was found that the overall grain production had an inverse relation to temperature, but it had a positive correlation with rainfall. It was observed that there was a continuous decline in the overall production of paddy and wheat. During deficiency years, it was found that when − 11.33% rainfall was deficient, paddy yield declined by − 1.52%. Further, a deviation of − 13.48% led to a decline of − 54.78% in wheat. The study advocates that timely policy interventions and strategies shall reduce climatic shocks and improve productivity. This would strengthen the livelihood security of the local communities, overcome the challenges of food security, and ensure long-term sustainability of Rangit River basin. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
"Unveiling the global nexus: Pandemic fear, government responses, and climate change-an empirical study","This study examined the relationships between pandemic fear, government responses, and climate change using a time-series dataset from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. By employing an auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach, the results revealed that pandemic fear significantly impacts climate change, while government responses to COVID-19 negatively influence climate change in the long run. Climate change and government responses significantly positively affect pandemic fear in the long run. Moreover, we found a bidirectional causality between government responses and climate change, unidirectional causality from government responses to pandemic fear, and no Granger causality between pandemic fear and climate change. Our findings have some important policy implications. Governments must encourage coordination, enhance crisis responses, and consider revising economic metrics to maintain environmental sustainability. The COVID-19 experience can inform strategies for reducing CO2 emissions and investing in green economies and healthcare to prepare for future challenges. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Forest Landscape Restoration and Its Impact on Social Cohesion, Ecosystems, and Rural Livelihoods: Lessons Learned from Pakistan","This paper explores community perspectives on forest landscape restoration (FLR) initiatives and their impacts on ecosystems, livelihoods and social cohesion. The study is based on data collected from 08 focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted in local communities involved in FLR activities. A coding process was used to identify key themes and patterns that shed light on the impacts of FLR. The results show that FLR initiatives have led to social cohesion and conflict resolution, including the establishment of community-based organizations (CBOs), the involvement of community volunteers in various FLR tasks, a cooperative/collaborative approach to forest management, conflict resolution, and the empowerment of local communities. In addition, the results of the study showed that FLRs have successfully regenerated and restored the forest ecosystem, including restoration of biodiversity, plant diversity, improvement of animal populations and livestock health, soil health, and water quality. Ecosystem restoration has improved community livelihoods, including increased crop productivity, access to education, affordable health care, improved economic conditions, and food security. Based on the findings, policy recommendations include strengthening support for community FLR initiatives, promoting stakeholder collaboration, and promoting social equity. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Understanding climate change vulnerability, adaptation and risk perceptions at household level in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan","Purpose: This study aims to investigate risks associated with climate change vulnerability and in response the adaptation methods used by farming communities to reduce its negative impacts on agriculture in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: The study used the household survey method of to collect data collected in Charsadda district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, involving 116 randomly selected respondents. Findings: Prevalent crops diseases, water scarcity, soil fertility loss and poor socio-economic conditions were main contributing factors of climate change vulnerability. The results further showed that changing crops type and cultivation pattern, improved seed varieties, planting shaded trees and the provision of excessive fertilizers are the measures adapted to improve agricultural productivity, which may reduce the climate change vulnerability at a household level. Research limitations/implications: The major limitation of this study was the exclusion of women from the survey due to religious and cultural barriers of in Pashtun society, wherein women and men do not mingle. Practical implications: Reducing climate change vulnerability and developing more effective adaptation techniques require assistance from the government. This help can be in the form of providing basic resources, such as access to good quality agricultural inputs, access to information and extension services on climate change adaptation and modern technologies. Consultation with other key stakeholder is also required to create awareness and to build the capacity of the locals toward reducing climate change vulnerability and facilitating timely and effective adaptation. Originality/value: This original research work provides evidence about farm-level vulnerability, adaptation strategies and risk perceptions on dealing with climate-change-induced natural disasters in Pakistan. This paper enriches existing knowledge of climate change vulnerability and adaptation in this resource-limited country so that effective measures can be taken to reduce vulnerability of farming communities, and enhance their adaptive capability. © 2018, Wahid Ullah, Takaaki Nihei, Muhammad Nafees, Rahman Zaman and Muhammad Ali.",Not About Sufficiency

Identifying efficient agricultural irrigation strategies in Crete,"Water scarcity and droughts are a major concern in most Mediterranean countries. Agriculture is a major user of water in the region and releases significant amounts of surface and ground waters, endangering the sustainable use of the available resources. Best Management Practices (BMPs) can mitigate the agriculture impacts on quantity of surface waters in agricultural catchments. However, identification of efficient BMPs strategies is a complex task, because BMPs costs and effectiveness can vary significantly within a basin. In this study, sustainable agricultural practices were studied based on optimal allocation of irrigation water use for dominant irrigated crops in the island of Crete, Greece. A decision support tool that integrates the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model, an economic model, and multi-objective optimization routines, was used to identify and locate optimal irrigation strategies by considering crop water requirements, impact of irrigation changes on crop productivity, management strategies costs, and crop market prices. Three spatial scales (crop type, fields, and administrative regions) were considered to point out different approaches of efficient management. According to the analysis, depending on the spatial scale and complexity of spatial optimization, water irrigation volumes could be reduced by 32%–70% while preserving current agricultural benefit. Specific management strategies also looked at ways to relocate water between administrative regions (4 prefectures in the case of Crete) to optimize crop benefit while reducing global water use. It was estimated that an optimal reallocation of water could reduce irrigation water volumes by 52% (148 Mm3/y) at the cost of a 7% (48 M€) loss of agricultural income, but maintaining the current agricultural benefit (626.9 M€). The study showed how the identification of optimal, cost-effective irrigation management strategies can potentially address the water scarcity issue that is becoming crucial for the viability of agriculture in the Mediterranean region. © 2018",Not About Sufficiency
Institutionalising decarbonisation in South Africa: navigating climate mitigation and socio-economic transformation,"Strong climate institutional governance is necessary for countries to meet their international climate mitigation commitments. This article shows that while South Africa steadily created climate institutions up to 2011, these failed to take hold in the following years. Also, despite the systemically critical energy sector dominating the emissions profile, these climate institutions had no purchase over it. This situation is largely due to South Africa’s political economy of energy, which gave powerful actors the sustained ability to block meaningful institutionalisation of decarbonisation in the energy sector. As a result, South Africa’s climate institutions play few of the roles expected for successful institutionalization of climate action, with energy institutions instead playing a shadow climate governance role. This case suggests that conceptions of climate institutional governance in countries where single sectors dominate in emissions and power must accommodate the roles of institutions affecting climate outcomes despite this not being their primary objective. © 2021 The Author(s).

"Developing country perspectives on 'mitigation actions', 'NAMAs', and 'LCDS'","The MAPS programme, which seeks to deepen mitigation ambition in developing countries, is engaged in exploring the concepts of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and Low Carbon Development Strategies (LCDS) from a developing country perspective. Here, climate mitigation practitioners in six developing countries were surveyed for their understanding of these concepts (anonymous, personal communications with climate mitigation practitioners in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, India, and South Africa). It is found that there is much scope for clarity and conceptual elaboration in this policy space. NAMAs are largely interpreted as mitigation activities packaged for submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) registry, but are not held to constitute the full set of mitigation activity in a developing country. New terminology may be needed to describe this broader set. A tighter interpretation of LCDS to distinguish between a strategic or coordinating policy action may be useful. Other themes arising include the way 'national appropriateness' is reflected in the concepts, and the role of international policy in deepening mitigation action in developing countries. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Review on Research Trend and Social Sustainability of E-Mobility,"The present review aims to identify the research trend and social sustainability of e-mobility using a four-step review methodology. Initially, 3083 publications appeared in the search on filtration applying selection criteria. The quality of the article before analysis is validated through a mixed methods appraisal tool (MMAT), leading to a sample size of 24 for content analysis. The research trends on the social aspect and sustainability highlight the role of transport in economic and social development, emphasising infrastructure development and the importance of end-user awareness in acceptance of electric vehicles and purchase intention. The EV literature highlights more on the technological aspects. Integration of social aspects in evaluating end-user perception, end-user acceptance and influence on end-user may boost EV adoption. This review analysis on the social sustainability of electric vehicles discusses why reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector is essential to meet global national and provincial emissions targets concerning climate change and SDG7. © 2022, Central Board of Irrigation and Power.

Making a New World: Founding capitalism in the Bajìo and Spanish North America,"Making a New World is a major rethinking of the role of the Americas in early world trade, the rise of capitalism, and the conflicts that reconfigured global power around 1800. At its center is the Bajío, a fertile basin extending across the modern-day Mexican states of Guanajuato and Querétaro, northwest of Mexico City. The Bajío became part of a new world in the 1530s, when Mesoamerican Otomís and Franciscan friars built Querétaro, a town that quickly thrived on agriculture and trade. Settlement accelerated as regional silver mines began to flourish in the 1550s. Silver tied the Bajío to Europe and China; it stimulated the development of an unprecedented commercial, patriarchal, Catholic society. A frontier extended north across vast expanses settled by people of European, Amerindian, and African ancestry. As mining, cloth making, and irrigated cultivation increased, inequities deepened and religious debates escalated. Analyzing the political economy, social relations, and cultural conflicts that animated the Bajío and Spanish North America from 1500 to 1800, John Tutino depicts an engine of global capitalism and the tensions that would lead to its collapse into revolution in 1810. © 2011 by Duke University Press.

Climate change in south-west Australia and north-west China: Challenges and opportunities for crop production,"Predictions from climate simulation models suggest that by 2050 mean temperatures on the Loess Plateau of China will increase by 2.5 to 3.75C, while those in the cropping region of south-west Australia will increase by 1.25 to 1.75C. By 2050, rainfall is not expected to change on the Loess Plateau of China, while in south-west Australia rainfall is predicted to decrease by 20 to 60mm. The frequency of heat waves and dry spells is predicted to increase in both regions. The implications of rising temperatures are an acceleration of crop phenology and a reduction in crop yields, greater risk of reproductive failure from extreme temperatures, and greater risk of crop failure. The reduction in yield from increased phenological development can be countered by selecting longer-season cultivars and taking advantage of warmer minimum temperatures and reduced frost risk to plant earlier than with current temperatures. Breeding for tolerance of extreme temperatures will be necessary to counter the increased frequency of extreme temperatures, while a greater emphasis on breeding for increased drought resistance and precipitation-use efficiency will lessen the impact of reduced rainfall. Management options likely to be adopted in south-west Australia include the introduction of drought-tolerant perennial fodder species and shifting cropping to higher-rainfall areas. On the Loess Plateau of China, food security is paramount so that an increased area of heat-tolerant and high-yielding maize, mulching with residues and plastic film, better weed and pest control and strategic use of supplemental irrigation to improve rainfall-use efficiency are likely to be adopted. © 2011 CSIRO.",Not About Sufficiency
Reservoirs and human well being: New challenges for evaluating impacts and benefits in the neotropics,"As in many other continents, neotropical ecosystems are impacted by the construction of reservoirs. These artificial ecosystems change considerably the natural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity. The multiple uses of reservoirs promote benefits for the human beings in terms of economic development, income, jobs and employment. Services of reservoirs are important assets for the regional ecosystem. Evaluation of ecosystem services produced by artificial reservoirs, are new challenges to the understanding of the cost/benefit relationships of reservoir construction in the neotropics. Regulating and other services promoted by reservoirs lead to new trends for ""green technology"" and the implementation of ecohydrological and ecotechnological developments. This approach can be utilized with better success as a substitute for the usual impact/benefit evaluation of the reservoirs. Better and diversified services can be achieved with ""green technology"" applied to the construction.",Not About Sufficiency
Developing Pathways for Sustainable Agricultural Development in Zimbabwe by 2030,"Agricultural production systems in Zimbabwe are facing high intensity of climate change impacts. Stakeholders require actionable information to direct investments towards a climate resilient future. The Agricultural Model Inter-comparison and Improvement Project, Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience (AgMIP CLARE) uses an integrated multi-modeling approach to support policy-level decision making and priority setting for sustainable development and climate adaptation with the goal of improving farmers’ livelihoods, food and nutrition security and gender equity. The Zimbabwe Vision 2030 was used to co-develop, with stakeholders’ and experts, plausible future scenarios of the agricultural sector in Zimbabwe. For systems like in Nkayi district, the simulation results illustrate that investing in a sustainable future, yields more favourable outcomes than investing in ‘high emission’ economic growth: pro-active diversification and intensification of small (traditional) grains and legumes and integration with livestock, supported by inclusive, functional value chains and access to information leads to higher returns per unit land on farm. Policies and interventions that promote a switch to more legumes in the farming systems, and make the uptake of productivity enhancing technologies more attractive, achieve greater food and nutrition security and increase social and economic equity, offset the impacts of climate change and improve farmers livelihoods. Importantly, to make effective investments there is need to create incentives for all farmers to invest; under a sustainable future, vulnerability is less and the poorest benefit more. Deciding for one future helps prioritizing what it would take in terms of policies and investments to achieve the vision 2030. Testing technologies and adaptations under different possible futures, integrating socio-economic and agro-ecological dimensions across different scales, simulation experiments helps stakeholders and experts to design and evaluate policies aimed at meeting sustainable development, climate and food security goals. © The Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries (NAM S&T Centre) 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Strategies for improving recycling behaviour within the Cornwall National Health Service (NHS) in the UK,"This paper examines strategies for improving recycling behaviour within the Cornwall National Health Service (NHS). Using quantitative (questionnaires and waste bin analyses) and qualitative (ethnography and interviews) methodologies, the study examined the waste management practices of staff from the Cornwall NHS. It was found that employee participation in waste recycling at work was low due to a range of factors including NHS focus and policies, group norms, and individual attitudes and beliefs about sustainable waste management. Recommendations for improving the sustainability of NHS, employee waste management practices, with a specific focus on recycling are included in the paper.

Effect of wastewater irrigation on biodiesel quality and productivity from castor and sunflower oil seeds,"Since biofuels are capturing a significant share in the energy consumption pattern, serious concerns have been declared regarding the impacts of biofuel production on environmental quality. One environmental aspect that has gained attention, is the significant water consumption for cultivations of biofuel crops and it is strictly related to the water scarcity encountered in many regions as a result of climate change, so alternative water sources such as wastewater can be exploited. The purpose of this paper is to study the use of wastewater as irrigation feedstock for cultivations of sunflower and castor crops and to track the effect of critical parameters on oil and biodiesel quality. Parameters such as oil yield, acid value, density and viscosity were measured and it was observed that wastewater irrigation can have a positive impact on oil's quality for biodiesel production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
A Study on Water Markets and the International Experience Gained from their Establishment,"Water markets are considered an excellent economic instrument for water management as they lead to a more efficient allocation and use of the resource. Their establishment and operation has been promoted due to the fact that the steadily increasing demand is creating water scarcity problems in many regions of the world and that existing management policies are proving ineffective in addressing modern challenges. This paper attempts to carry out a comprehensive review of water markets as an alternative method for water management by presenting their main characteristics as well as the international experience gained from their establishment in different regions of the world. For this purpose, a systematic review of the international literature in the Google Scholar and Scopus databases was carried out using specific criteria. In particular, 144 studies were found that met the search criteria set and finally 91 of them were selected as a source of information for the writing of this paper. The processing of these papers provided information on how water markets operate, their background, the advantages and disadvantages associated with their establishment and their adoption by countries with different characteristics. The main conclusions that emerge are that water markets on the one hand increase the economic efficiency of water by encouraging the movement of water quantities to users who are able to attribute to them high economic value and on the other hand that their establishment and operation are linked to neoliberal economic policies that are often criticised and at the same time raise issues of social justice and equal treatment of different users. © 2022, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

An integrated information system of climate-watermigrations-conflicts nexus in the congo basin,"We present an integrated information system needed to address the climate-water-migration-conflict nexus in the Congo Basin. It is based on a rigorous and multidisciplinary methodological approach that consists of designing appropriate tools for field surveys and data collection campaigns, data analysis, creating a statistical database and creating a web interface with the aim to make this information system publicly available for users and stakeholders. The information system developed is a structured and organized set of quantitative and qualitative data on the climatewater-migration-conflict nexus and gender, consisting of primary data collected during field surveys. It contains 250 aggregated variables or 575 disaggregated variables, all grouped into 15 thematic areas, including identification; socio-demographic characteristics; access to resources; perception of climate change; perception of migration; financial inclusion (savings, access to credit and circulation of money); domination and control on water resources, land ownership and property rights, conflict resolution and community resilience; water uses; vulnerability to climate change; housing, household assets and household expenditure; food security; health, hygiene and sanitation; environmental risk management; women’s economic autonomy; and water transfer from the Congo Basin to Lake Chad. The information system can be used to model and understand the interface of human-environment interactions, and develop scenarios necessary to address the challenges of climate change and resilient development, while supporting key policy areas and strategies to foster effective stakeholder participation to ensure management and governance of climate and natural resources in the Congo Basin. © 2021 by the authors.

Assessing preferences for forest carbon credit and co-benefits: A choice experiment case study in Japan,"This study investigated corporate preferences for forest carbon credit offsets. The preferences were elicited through a choice experiment by administering a questionnaire to determine the price of credit, location of forest sequestration project offset, social development on local employment, preservation of ecosystem services, and unit of sustainable development goals (SDGs). We also examined stated preferences for credit offset and the willingness to pay. The analysis employed multinomial logit and random parameter logit (RPL) models to account for heterogeneity in preferences. The results showed that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) held a neutral stance regarding offsetting their emissions and were categorized as being in the early stages of engagement with carbon offsetting. As SMEs can decide whether to purchase credit, we assessed their preferences for the type of credit-based forest carbon sequestration. SMEs had a significant preference for the location of the project, SDGs, and credit price when deciding to purchase credit based on the RPL model estimates. They were willing to pay JPY 6,191 (approximately USD 41) for the location of a project to be local rather than overseas, JPY 933 for a higher number of unit SDGs, and JPY 131 for an increase in the number of jobs. These results suggest that SMEs prefer purchasing local credit generated within their prefecture as a carbon offset alternative. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

Mediating role of internationalization readiness in the adoption of social sustainability practices: Evidence from Vietnamese handicraft companies,"This study investigates the mediating role of internationalization readiness in the adoption of social sustainability practices (SSP) by companies in the Vietnamese handicraft industry. Data were collected from 325 Vietnamese handicraft companies through a questionnaire survey to empirically validate a conceptual model. The findings reveal that government, laborer, and market pressures on SSP adoption are fully mediated by internationalization readiness. The results also show that supplier pressures influence SSP adoption both directly and through internationalization readiness as a mediator. Furthermore, both internationalization readiness and SSP adoption can positively influence overall organizational performance. This study is the first of its kind to corroborate the application of the stakeholder theory and the resource-based view theory to explore the impactful role of internationalization readiness in SSP adoption. It provides significant insights for managers, public policymakers, and sustainability practitioners to promote greater adoption of SSP across the entire supply chain through fostering internationalization readiness of companies. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Heavy metals in recovered fines from construction and demolition debris recycling facilities in Florida,"A major product recovered from the processing and recycling of construction and demolition (C&D) debris is screened soil, also referred to as fines. A proposed reuse option for C&D debris fines is fill material, typically in construction projects as a substitute for natural soil. Waste material that is reused in a manner similar to soil must first be characterized to examine potential risks to human health and the environment. In Florida, samples of C&D debris fines from 13 C&D debris recycling facilities were characterized for 11 total and leachable heavy metal concentrations. Total metal concentration results (mg/kg) were compared to existing data on background Florida soil concentrations and to Florida's risk-based soil cleanup target levels (SCTLs). All of the detected metals were found to be elevated with respect to background. The 95% upper confidence level of arsenic from 99 samples was 3.2 mg/kg; arsenic presented the greatest limitation to reuse when compared to the SCTLs. Lead was not found to pose a major problem, likely because of the relatively new building infrastructure in Florida, which results in less demolition debris and less material impacted by lead-based paint. The results of batch leaching tests conducted using simulated rainwater (mg/l) were compared directly to risk-based groundwater levels for Florida and were found not to pose a risk using existing risk assessment policies. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Evidence in support of the role of disturbance vegetation for women's health and childcare in Western Africa,"Background: In savannah-dominated Bénin, West Africa, and forest-dominated Gabon, Central Africa, plants are a major source of healthcare for women and children. Due to this high demand and the reliance on wild populations as sources for medicinal plants, overharvesting of African medicinal plants is a common concern. Few studies in Western Africa, however, have assessed variations in harvest patterns across different ecological zones and within local communities. Methods: We investigated which vegetation types women accessed to harvest medicinal plants by conducting 163 questionnaires with market vendors and women from urban and rural communities. We made botanical vouchers of cited species and collected information on their vegetation type and cultivation status. Results: Secondary vegetation was a crucial asset; over 80% of the 335 Beninese and 272 Gabonese plant species came from disturbance vegetation and home gardens. In Bénin, access to trade channels allowed female market vendors to use more vulnerable species than rural and urban women who harvested for personal use. In Gabon, no relationship was found between vulnerable plant use and informant type. Conclusions: This study highlights the underemphasized point that secondary vegetation is an asset for women and children's health in both savanna-dominated and forest-dominated landscapes. The use of disturbance vegetation demonstrates women's resilience in meeting healthcare needs in the limited amount of space that is available to them. Species of conservation concern included forest species and savanna trees sold at markets in Bénin, especially Xylopia aethiopica, Khaya senegalensis, and Monodora myristica, and the timber trees with medicinal values in Gabon, such as Baillonella toxisperma. © 2014 Towns et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Cobalt enhanced the drought-stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa L.) by mitigating the oxidative damage and enhancing yield attributes,"Water scarcity is one of the most important abiotic factors limiting rice growth and productivity. The application of nutrients affects various physiological and biochemical mechanisms to curtail water deficiency, but little is known about the ameliorative effects of cobalt (Co) on rice. Our study aimed to investigate the advantageous effects of soaking in Co at the optimum concentration (10 and 44.5 µM) on morpho-physiological traits and oxidative stress, during the vegetative and reproductive stages, also assessing yield attributes, in two rice varieties (Sakha 104, drought-sensitive, and Giza 178, drought-tolerant). Treatments included control (100% field capacity (FC)), moderate drought stress (75 % FC), and severe drought stress (50 % FC) either alone or in combination with Co. A water deficit and oxidative stress affected Giza 178 less than Sakha 104. Co application significantly enhanced the performance of two rice varieties under drought stress by increasing plant height, biomass, water content, tillering, leaf area, pigments (chlorophyll a, carotenoids, total chlorophyll), sugars (soluble sugars, and total carbohydrates), and Co content (shoot and root). Also, Co significantly increased the performance of the antioxidant system by elevating the concentration of total phenols, flavonoids, proline, and antioxidant enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase), while significantly decreasing chlorophyll b, malondialdehyde, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl. Yield attributes such as the number of tillers, panicle parameters (number, length, and weight), 100-grain weight, harvest index, and grain nutritive value (sugars, vitamin B, and Co contents) were significantly enhanced by Co in both varieties. However, the maximum performance was observed in Giza 178. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Emerging infectious diseases and the dynamic comeback of the old enemies,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are classified as infectious diseases for which the incidence has increased in the past 20 years. To date, EIDs account for at least 12% of all human pathogens. In the previous century, the heavy public health burden of infectious diseases had faded in the developed world due to improvements in public health measures and an increased quality of life, as well as through the use of antibiotics, vaccinations, insecticides, and the improved surveillance. However, by the late twentieth century, an increase in the incidence of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases was observed in many parts of the world. Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, and their determinants, have led to increasing global concern with regards to public health. Indeed, over the past decades, approximately 30 EIDs, including Legionnaires disease, human immunodeficiency virus, several viral hemorrhagic fevers, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and avian influenza, have been identified, posing a significant burden on global economies and public health. The common and interactive codeterminants of disease emergence are population growth, travel, trade, migration, and the social disruption of war and conflict, as well as human-induced global changes, including widespread forest clearance and climate change. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
ROMANIAN COAL AND THE ENERGY TRILEMA,"Multiple crises in recent years, including the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the global energy crisis, the climate crisis, the decarbonization of the energy mix, the European Green Pact, the energy transition, the conflict in Ukraine, and the energy trilemma, have created the conditions for a new energy revolution. If the listed influencing factors, the sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas as well as the confrontation with the components of the trilemma, energy security, minimal impact on the environment and access to commercial energy for all are taken into account, ambitious commitments and programs to gradually eliminate fossil fuels (coal) from the energy equation and to replace suppliers of this type of fuels with suppliers of ""clean fuels"" will not be met by the established deadlines. The economic and technical obstacles that must be surmounted to assure energy efficiency, energy independence, and sustainability impose a cost on the final consumers (domestic and industrial), who are constrained by certain affordability limits. Can Romanian coal still be regarded a safety element for the national energy system under these circumstances? Although today's fossil fuel resources will sustain the Romanian economy at the present rate of extraction for another century, can they be adapted to meet environmental standards so that the cost of a kilowatt-hour of energy is affordable for all? Can the decarbonization of the energy sector be delayed in the current international context so as to minimize the risk of ""energy poverty"" among consumers and not increase Romania's electricity import?

Green bonds for the Paris agreement and sustainable development goals,"The Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations Development Programme both entail substantial global investments through cost-efficient, long-term financing. Noted for their risk-alleviating features and appeal to institutional and socially responsible investors, green bonds are gaining prominence in climate change and sustainable development finance frameworks. This study is the first to thoroughly examine publicly reported green bond proceeds allocations from 53 organizations to projects and assets throughout 96 countries from 2008 to 2017. Green bond markets are growing rapidly, and yearly proceeds allocation trends reveal increasing disbursements to renewable energy, clean water, low-carbon transportation, and other Paris Agreement and SDG-related investment categories. Circle plot analysis reveals unique allocation trends to specific green sectors at both regional and national levels. International finance institutions allocated the largest share of proceeds by both frequency and volume, and the projects and assets financed with green bonds in this study sample are associated with over 108 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in greenhouse gas emissions reductions and over 1500 gigawatts in renewable energy capacity.

Deficit irrigation affects seasonal changes in leaf physiology and oil quality of Olea europaea (cultivars Frantoio and Leccino),"The olive tree is a traditionally nonirrigated crop that occupies quite an extensive agricultural area in Mediterranean-type agroecosystems. Improvements in water-use efficiency of crops are essential under the scenarios of water scarcity predicted by global change models for the Mediterranean region. Recently, irrigation has been introduced to increase the low land productivity, but there is little information on ecophysiological aspects and quality features intended for a sagacious use of water, while being of major importance for the achievement of high-quality products as olive oil. Therefore, deficit irrigation programmes were developed to improve water-use efficiency, crop productivity and quality in a subhumid zone of Southern Italy with good winter-spring precipitation. The response of mature olive trees to deficit irrigation in deep soils was studied on cultivars Frantoio and Leccino by examining atmospheric environment and soil moisture, gas exchange and plant water status, as well as oil yield and chemical analysis. Trees were not irrigated (rainfed) or subjected to irrigation at 66% and 100% of crop evapotranspiration (ETC), starting from pit hardening to early fruit veraison. Improvements in the photosynthetic capacity induced by increasing soil water availability were only of minor importance. However, plant water status was positively influenced by deficit irrigation, with 66% and 100% of ETC treatments hardly differing from one another though consistently diverging from rainfed plants. The effect of water stress on photosynthesis was mainly dependent on diffusion resistances in response to soil moisture. Leccino showed higher instantaneous water-use efficiency than Frantoio. Crop yield increased proportionally to the amount of seasonal water volume, confirming differences between cultivars in water-use efficiency. The unsaturated/saturated and the monounsaturated/ polyunsaturated fatty acid ratios of the oil also differed between cultivars, while the watering regime had minor effects. Although irrigation can modify the fatty acid profile, polyphenol contents were scarcely affected by the water supply. Irrigation to 100% of ETC in the period August-September might be advisable to achieve high-quality yields, while saving consistent amounts of water. © 2007 Association of Applied Biologists.",Not About Sufficiency
"Intensity, frequency and coverage of hydro-meteorological droughts and agriculture in the semi-arid basins of Maharashtra (India)","The present investigation attempted to understand the intensity, frequency and spatial coverage of rainfall, runoff, groundwater and agricultural droughts in the semi-arid region of Maharashtra during 1981–2014. For this, various indices similar to Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (probabilistic nature) were applied. The linear regression, partial correlation and Student’s t-Test techniques were also used to evaluate inter-connections in hydro-meteorological and agricultural droughts. The hydrological deficiencies mimic the pattern of meteorological droughts in the study area with respect to coverage and intensity. Moderate hydro-meteorological droughts occurred frequently (once in 3 to 4 years). Additionally, the research highlighted an increase in the frequency and intensity of hydrological droughts during the post-1990 period, possibly linked to anthropogenic interventions (dam constructions and irrigation expansion). Despite El Niño events resulting in below-average rainfall, runoff, and groundwater levels in the study area, other phenomena such as Equatorial Indian Ocean Monsoon Oscillation (EQUINOO) / Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) may have played a crucial role in major drought occurrences in 1986, 2003, and 2012 (events that happen once in > 30 years). The hydro-meteorological droughts lead to agricultural droughts, as they significantly affect the rainfed and irrigated crops in terms of productivity and cropped area. This effect was particularly notable during severe and region-wide droughts in 1985-86, 2002-03, and 2011-12. Furthermore, the investigation suggested that the study area is likely to experience hydro-meteorological deficiencies with ~ 25% probability between 2029 and 2050, coupled with a significant temperature rise (by 1.05 °C). This projected scenario could exacerbate water scarcity and agricultural distress in the future (up to 2050). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Water policy implications of perennial expansion in the Guadalquivir River Basin (southern Spain),"This paper analyses the impacts and water policy implications of an increase of perennial crops on irrigation water requirements and on the vulnerability of the agricultural system to climatic events in the case of the Guadalquivir River basin. As indicated by the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), the characterisation of a river basin requires information on the major economic drivers and pressures at river basin scale. Guadalquivir River basin (southern Spain) can be considered a representative Mediterranean case study that has faced basin closure and continues the trend towards increased crop intensification and greater water-use efficiency. Our result shows an increased vulnerability to drought and water scarcity in the basin due to the expansion of irrigated perennial crops and a decrease of RIS (relative irrigation supply) from 0.70 to 0.56 in the period 2000–2021, thereby forcing farmers to adopt deficit irrigation techniques. The potential increase in the frequency of droughts and the growth of irrigation water requirements (IWR) due to higher temperatures, raise the vulnerability of the system to extreme climate events. Such findings can be employed to support the efficient allocation of water resources in order to improve water policy through its adaptation to increasing risks related to droughts and water scarcity. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

QTLs and Genes for Salt Stress Tolerance: A Journey from Seed to Seed Continued,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a crucial crop contributing to global food security; however, its production is susceptible to salinity, a significant abiotic stressor that negatively impacts plant germination, vigour, and yield, degrading crop production. Due to the presence of exchangeable sodium ions (Na+), the affected plants sustain two-way damage resulting in initial osmotic stress and subsequent ion toxicity in the plants, which alters the cell’s ionic homeostasis and physiological status. To adapt to salt stress, plants sense and transfer osmotic and ionic signals into their respective cells, which results in alterations of their cellular properties. No specific Na+ sensor or receptor has been identified in plants for salt stress other than the SOS pathway. Increasing productivity under salt-affected soils necessitates conventional breeding supplemented with biotechnological interventions. However, knowledge of the genetic basis of salinity stress tolerance in the breeding pool is somewhat limited because of the complicated architecture of salinity stress tolerance, which needs to be expanded to create salt-tolerant variants with better adaptability. A comprehensive study that emphasizes the QTLs, genes and governing mechanisms for salt stress tolerance is discussed in the present study for future research in crop improvement. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Coping With Climate Change: a Food Policy Approach1,"The early drafts of Food Policy Analysis were stimulated by the attention to high food prices following the world food crisis in 1973–74, and the fears of a repeat in 1979–80. But by the fourth full draft, in 1982, it became apparent that surpluses were returning to world food markets. A volume predicated on a world running out of food would have been out of date before the ink was dry, and a full-scale revamping of the analytical messages was needed. After a nearly complete re-write, the new theme, which has stood the test of 30 years of market fluctuations, was the need for flexibility to cope with market instability. That message is even more relevant now, as we learn to cope with a new source of instability—climate change. Such flexibility is not a natural feature of domestic policymaking, in the food sector or elsewhere, and providing the analytical tools for understanding how to create flexible responses turned out to be a real challenge. The task in this paper is to ask specifically how climate change would alter the basic message of Food Policy Analysis. Virtually all of the analysis was focused on national policies and domestic markets, an approach that seems problematical for preventing or mitigating climate change, but entirely appropriate for designing adaptation strategies. Climate change is imposing itself as a reality via the increased probability of extreme weather events in general, and also on both global and localized food security outcomes in particular. The ecosystem services provided by the climate are essential for all agricultural production. The most important effects of climate change on agriculture are likely to include a net global loss of agricultural land, changing crop suitability, an increase in the frequency of natural disasters, and greater temporal and geographic variance in production. It will also have negative effects on other areas of agriculture broadly interpreted—reducing the carrying capacity of many rangelands and posing threats to fisheries and aquaculture production systems. Climate change is expected to have highly variable effects on different regions; tropical and equatorial regions will bear the heaviest burdens, with some gains in yields and land availability in temperate regions. Since rural poverty is concentrated in tropical and, in South Asia, coastal areas, climate change is expected to have a disproportionate effect on the already vulnerable. The challenge is to design, analyze, and implement in-country “climate-smart agriculture” adaptation projects and programs, which are now part of the food policy agenda, as well as to improve the openness to trade in agricultural commodities to even out geographical instability. Designing appropriate policies for bio-fuels also needs to be on the analytical agenda. © 2014 Policy Studies Organization.",Not About Sufficiency
Investor-state dispute settlement: obstructing a just energy transition,"Governments that revoke licenses and permits or take other measures to restrict the development of oil and gas in their territory will face claims from investors for compensation. When investors are foreign, they can seek compensation for ‘lost future profits’ in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), even if they had not commenced production. ISDS cases are likely to obstruct a just transition by chilling supply-side climate measures and diverting public funds away from climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Using a dataset of ISDS-protected assets in the upstream oil and gas sector, we demonstrate that the global distribution of legal and financial risks is highly unjust. More than two thirds of the net-present value of 1.5°C-incompatible and treaty-protected oil and gas assets are found in low- and middle-income countries, including those highly vulnerable to climate change. The Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) is the most significant single treaty obstructing the transition. While protection of fossil fuels in some countries may soon be phased-out of this treaty, the protection of the assets identified in our study will remain for at least ten more years. To limit ISDS risk, states should: (1) immediately cease the issuance of new permits/leases for oil and gas developments; (2) terminate investment treaties (including the ECT) and (3) develop binding rules that cap the amount of compensation that can be awarded to investors. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"Homogenous Climatic Regions for Targeting Green Water Management Technologies in the Abbay Basin, Ethiopia","Spatiotemporal climate variability is a leading environmental constraint to the rain-fed agricultural productivity and food security of communities in the Abbay basin and elsewhere in Ethiopia. The previous one-size-fits-all approach to soil and water management technology targeting did not effectively address climate-induced risks to rain-fed agriculture. This study, therefore, delineates homogenous climatic regions and identifies climate-induced risks to rain-fed agriculture that are important to guide decisions and the selection of site-specific technologies for green water management in the Abbay basin. The k-means spatial clustering method was employed to identify homogenous climatic regions in the study area, while the Elbow method was used to determine an optimal number of climate clusters. The k-means clustering used the Enhancing National Climate Services (ENACTS) daily rainfall, minimum and maximum temperatures, and other derived climate variables that include daily rainfall amount, length of growing period (LGP), rainfall onset and cessation dates, rainfall intensity, temperature, potential evapotranspiration (PET), soil moisture, and AsterDEM to define climate regions. Accordingly, 12 climate clusters or regions were identified and mapped for the basin. Clustering a given geographic region into homogenous climate classes is useful to accurately identify and target locally relevant green water management technologies to effectively address local-scale climate-induced risks. This study also provided a methodological framework that can be used in the other river basins of Ethiopia and, indeed, elsewhere. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

"Livelihood Vulnerability Due to Climate Change: The Case of the Khmer Community in Mekong Delta, Vietnam","In the context of international globalization and integration, there are both opportunities and challenges in the development of the Mekong Delta since this region is sensitive to changes in nature. The magnitude of climate change, sea-level rises, saltwater intrusion, and coastal erosion is more significant than forecasts suggested, leading to extreme weather events and affecting human lives. The negative impacts of climate change have caused serious damage to the livelihoods of households, especially for the Khmer ethnic people. The present study was conducted in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. A total of 426 respondents were surveyed through structured questionnaires in Soc Trang, Tra Vinh, and Kien Giang provinces. The data were analyzed using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) with equal weighting and unequal weighting through principal component analysis (PCA). Based on the results, the livelihood vulnerability of Khmer households due to climate change in the Mekong Delta can be categorized as vulnerable or moderate. Depending on the LVI or the LVI by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (LVI-IPCC) approach and the calculation method used, the level of vulnerability was found to vary among localities. Typically, Khmer households in Kien Giang had the highest level of LVI vulnerability when using equal weights, whereas Tra Vinh had the highest level of LVI vulnerability and was classified as very vulnerable when using equal weight. In addition, the results using PCA weights showed that livelihood strategies, well-being, and environmental shocks are important contributors to the livelihood vulnerability of Khmer households. Our findings suggest that government policies should involve local organizations and enterprises to improve the living standards and sustainable livelihoods of Khmer households. © Common Ground Research Networks, Nguyen Thi Thuy Loan, Diep Thanh Tung, All Rights Reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Household agricultural activities and child growth: evidence from rural Timor-Leste,"Childhood under-nutrition and malnutrition are prevalent in low and middle-income countries. Where agriculture is the primary source of food production, consumption, and cash income, it has a close relationship with health and nutrition in these emerging economies. Although Timor-Leste achieved lower middle-income status in 2011, national economic growth has not delivered anticipated nutritional dividends. Seeking to redress a lack of research that clearly demonstrates how agriculture impacts on nutrition in Timor-Leste, we investigated the links between household agricultural activities and children's physical growth in two agro-ecologically varying field sites: lowland Natarbora and mountainous Ossu. Children in both sites were below World Health Organization standards in height, weight, and body mass index. Coastal children recorded better growth than upland children. Livestock production was linked to poorer growth in the upland, but not coastal communities, which may be linked to specific differences in husbandry practices. In both communities, access to a plantation was somewhat associated with children's (0–10 years) increased weight-for-age. As simple agricultural indicators do not fully explain growth outcomes, a livelihood security approach is proposed to better understand how households address food and nutritional needs in relation to broader livelihood concerns. © 2017 Institute of Australian Geographers",Not About Sufficiency
"Health Inequalities in South Asia at the Launch of Sustainable Development Goals: Exclusions in Health in Kerala, India Need Political Interventions","Despite substantial progress in social development during the post-colonial period, health inequalities in the South Asian countries were staggering, with reduced life expectancy, higher maternal and child mortality, and gender discrimination. Notably, even with the rapid economic growth during the neoliberal period, India fares below most of the South Asian countries in several health indicators. The Indian state of Kerala stands out with social sector gains; nevertheless, evidence indicates widening health inequalities, restricted public arenas, and undemocratic practices in health, particularly in the context of increasing market logic in the health and social arenas shaping health. The caste, class, gender, and ethnic ideologies and patriarchal power structure interwoven in the sociopolitical, cultural, moral, and health discourses similar to the South Asian context raise serious inequalities for health. At the launch of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, the populations with lingering privations and forbidden freedoms for gaining better health in Kerala, similar to South Asia, were largely the dalits, ethnic and religious minorities, and women. This necessitates greater political interventions, recognizing the interacting effects of history, culture, social factors, politics, and policies on health. And public health research needs to underscore this approach. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Not About Sufficiency
Fisheries and failing states: The case of Sierra Leone,"Marine fisheries play an important role in the economy of Sierra Leone, supporting livelihoods and contributing significantly to food security. This paper looks in detail at how the performance of fisheries was impacted by the ten year civil war, an event which contributed to the country's reputation for being a ""failed state"". The paper focuses mainly on the artisanal fisheries sector, which employs the majority of the country's coastal population, and demonstrates how the conflict caused major social dislocation to fishing communities as well as reducing the productive capacity of the fleet. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy challenges now facing Sierra Leone, particularly the prevention of resource looting through illegal fishing of the offshore stocks and the development of strategies to enable the potential wealth of these fisheries to be captured. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Impacts of heat stress on global cattle production during the 21st century: a modelling study,"Background: Heat stress in animals is one of the major climate change impacts on domesticated livestock raised in both intensive and extensive production systems. At temperatures higher than an animal's thermoneutral zone, heat stress can affect liveweight gain, milk yield, and fertility. Animal welfare may also be negatively affected by heat stress even in the absence of effects on productivity, at least in the short term. Methods: We estimated the comparative statics change in the value of cattle milk and meat production from heat stress-induced losses at the global level, using climate scenario outputs for the middle (2045) and end of the century (2085). The loss estimates are based on bioenergetic equations that relate changes in dry matter intake (DMI) to both cold and hot, humid weather. DMI changes were estimated using CMIP6 climate data and linked to a global dataset containing information on livestock production systems, animal numbers, and region-specific and system-specific animal diets. Changes in DMI were converted to changes in milk and meat production and valued using early 20th century world prices (ie, constant 2005 US dollars). Findings: For a high greenhouse-gas emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), production losses from heat stress were estimated to amount to $39·94 billion (95% CI 34·39–45·49 billion) per year by the end of the century, or 9·8% of the value of production of meat and milk from cattle in 2005. For a low emission scenario (SSP1-2.6), the value of production losses was $14·89 billion (12·62–16·95 billion) per year, or 3·7% of 2005 value. In both scenarios, losses in most tropical regions were projected to be far greater than they were in temperate regions. Interpretation: Our results highlight the potential magnitude and extent of the adaptation efforts that will be necessary to combat the effects of increasing heat stress on cattle production during this century if food security challenges are to be minimised. Adaptations include switching to more heat-tolerant breeds and provision of shade, ventilation, and cooling systems. Funding: CGIAR Trust Fund and bilateral donors. © 2022 The Author(s).

Environmental health impacts of concentrated animal feeding operations: Anticipating hazards - Searching for solutions,"A scientific conference and workshop was held March 2004 in Iowa City, Iowa, that brought together environmental scientists from North America and Europe to address major environmental health issues associated with concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in large, industrialized livestock production facilities. After one and a half days of plenary sessions, five expert workgroups convened to consider the most relevant research areas, including respiratory health effects, modeling and monitoring of air toxics, water quality issues, influenza pandemics and antibiotic resistance, and community health and socioeconomic issues. The workgroup reports that follow outline the state of the science and public health concerns relating to livestock production as they apply to each workgroup topic. The reports also identify areas in which further research is needed and suggest opportunities to translate science to policy initiatives that would effect improvements in public and environmental health. Viable solutions to some of the current environmental health problems associated with CAFOs are outlined. In addition, these reports bring to light several major concerns, including air and water contamination, the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in livestock, and the specter of influenza outbreaks arising from siting industrialized poultry and swine production in proximity to each other and to humans.",Not About Sufficiency

The citation databases of Web of Science formed the basis for a novel strategic thematic analysis of co-citation and co-occurrence of keywords with a longitudinal identification of themes during the last two decades (from 1995 to 2015) of an emerging and ever growing research area. SI is a multidisciplinary endeavour, including a diversified array of disciplines as general engineering, environmental ecology, construction, architecture, urban planning, and geography. This paper traces that the number of publications in SI is growing exponentially since 2003. Over 80% of total citations are concentrated in less than 10% of papers spread over a large number of journals. Most publications originate from the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The main research streams in SI are green infrastructure, sustainable buildings, and assessment methods. Emerging and prevailing research themes include methodological issues of cost-effectiveness, project management and assessment tools. Substantive issues complement the research agenda of emerging themes in the areas of integration of human, economic and corporate social responsibility values in environmental sustainability, urban landscape and sustainable drainage systems, interdisciplinary research in green material, integrated policy research in urbanization, agriculture and nature conservation, and extensions of Green Building (GB) and GI to cities of developing countries. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Taking a more nuanced look at behavior change for demand reduction in the illegal wildlife trade,"The illegal wildlife trade threatens the future of many species, and undermines economies and livelihoods. Conservationists have largely responded with supply-side interventions, such as antipoaching patrols, but these often fail to stem the tide of wildlife trafficking. There is now increasing interest in demand-side interventions, which seek to lower poaching pressure on sought-after species by reducing consumer's desire for, and purchase of, specific wildlife products. Individual behavior change approaches, from environmental education to social marketing, have been widely advocated by academics, practitioners, and policy makers. However, this is an emerging field and we lack the breadth of evidence needed to understand and predict the potential outcomes of demand reduction interventions. To help us gain broader insights, we examine the literature from public health and international development on the effectiveness of behavior change interventions, and critique the current conceptualization of strategies for reducing consumer demand in the illegal wildlife trade. We show that behavior change is difficult to achieve and interventions may have unintended and undesirable consequences because of unaddressed systemic, cultural and environmental drivers, and limited resourcing. We conclude that some sections of the conservation community are advocating a shift from one reductionist approach based on limiting supply, to another based on limiting demand, and argue that conservationists should learn from the public health and international development projects that have integrated systems thinking. By accounting for the multiple interactions and synergies between different factors in the wildlife trade, we can develop more strategic approaches to protecting endangered species. © 2020 The Authors.

Extreme Events and Production Shocks for Key Crops in Southern Africa Under Climate Change,"Many studies have estimated the effect of climate change on crop productivity, often reflecting uncertainty about future climates by using more than one emissions pathway or multiple climate models, usually fewer than 30, and generally much fewer, with focus on the mean changes. Here we examine four emissions scenarios with 720,000 future climates per scenario over a 50-year period. We focus on the effect of low-frequency, high-impact weather events on crop yields in 10 countries of Southern Africa, aggregating from nearly 9,000 25-kilometer-square locations. In the highest emissions scenario, median maize yield is projected to fall by 9.2% for the region while the 5th percentile is projected to fall by 15.6% between the 2020s and 2060s. Furthermore, the frequency of a low frequency, 1-in-20-year low-yield event for rainfed maize is likely to occur every 3.5 years by the 2060s under the high emissions scenario. We also examine the impact of climate change on three other crops of considerable importance to the region: drybeans, groundnuts, and soybeans. Projected yield decline for each of these crops is less than for maize, but the impact varies from country to country and within each country. In many cases, the median losses are modest, but the losses in the bad weather years are generally much higher than under current climate, pointing to more frequent bouts with food insecurity for the region, unless investments are made to compensate for those production shocks.

Populations at Special Health Risk: Displaced Populations,"The number of displaced people in the world today - which includes those uprooted by violent conflict, natural disasters, economic development, climate change, and a variety of other causes - continues to grow. Such people face serious risks to their safety and health, related to the causes and effects of the flight itself, acute and chronic diseases, mental illness, and cultural dislocation. Women and children are particularly vulnerable. Responses - both in the countries of origin and internationally - are often inadequate, either because of insufficient resources or a lack of compassion and generosity from the world community. There is a need to rethink the definitions of 'refugee' and 'internally displaced person,' which are largely obsolete in the era of complex and changing internal and global forces, and to redesign the institutions that have been constructed to deal with the problem. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Climate change vulnerability of confined livestock systems predicted using bioclimatic indexes in an arid region of México,"Climate change is a major world-wide challenge to livestock production because food security is likely to be compromised by increased heat stress of the animals. The objective of this study was to characterize, using bioclimatic indexes, two livestock regions located in an arid zone of México, and to use this information to predict the impact of global warming on animal production systems of these regions located in the state of Baja California (México). A 5-year database (i.e., 2011 to 2015) consisting of about one million data points from two zones (i.e., coast, valley) from four meteorological stations in the north of Baja California were used. Bioclimatic indexes were constructed for the four types of livestock production systems most common in this region, being: dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, pigs. The temperature-humidity index (THI) thresholds used to classify heat stress were determined and scaled for each livestock species as: THIbeef and THIpig 74 units; THImilk 72 units; and THIsheep 23 units. Statistical differences between indices were detected (P < 0.01) during summer for the valley and coast zones as (THIbeef = 72.9 and 51.8; THImilk = 80.6 and 67.4; THIpigs = 83.9 and 65.2; THIsheep = 29.5 and 20.1 units). Coast zone weather did not suggest vulnerability of livestock production systems to heat stress at any time of the year, but heat stress risk during summer for valley zone dairy cattle, sheep and pigs was classified as severe, but lower for feedlot cattle. Prediction models showed significant adjustment just in the coastal zone for THImilk, THIsheep, and THIsheep, suggesting more impact of global warming during summer in the coastal zone. Use of management strategies to reduce heat load of domestic animals during summer in northern Baja California is essential to maintain their productivity, with more emphasis in the valley zone. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Mortality and pollution in several greek cities,"This study examined the atmospheric pollution created by industry and traffic areas nearby the city of Kavala and the mortality of citizens in the region. The mortality data spanned over a period of 30 years. The statistical data on mortality was collected from 1968 to 1998. The causes of mortality analyzed in this study were cancer, cardiovascular deaths and pulmonary deaths. The results of this study were compared with other Greek cities. Air measurements were made over a period of 6 months and included levels of gaseous emissions as well as concentrations of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), near the city of Kavala, where reservoirs of petroleum and exploitation of crude oil were present. Samples of air were collected from ambient surroundings near the industrial area and fuel oil facilities. The results obtained from the study indicated the presence of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons and other gaseous pollutants such as, methane, o-, m-, p-xylene and ethylbenzene, etc. In some cases the levels exceeded the concentration limits specified by the air quality standards. Offensive odors were also detected (H2S). The study revealed that adverse environmental impact of air pollutants is a major concern in the industrial centers more than in the rural areas. This poses a threat to the public health and may induce disease and premature deaths. These air pollutants play an important role in air quality.

Blood and soil? Resource scarcity and internal armed conflict revisited,"Scarcity of renewable resources is frequently argued to be a main driver of violent conflict. The 2004 and 2007 Nobel Peace Prize awards, as well as the international debate about the implications of climate change, show the salience of the topic as a security issue. Studies testing the link between renewable resource scarcity and armed conflict have reached diverging conclusions. One study, in particular, has found substantial support for eco-scarcity theory, while most others have found a limited association. This article starts with an attempt at replicating earlier findings on the link between population density, soil degradation, deforestation, water scarcity and civil war, but several results are not replicable. The final results lend little support to a purported link between resource scarcity and civil conflict, whereas it replicates earlier findings on the importance of poverty, instability and dependence of fuel exports. A high level of land degradation is the only factor that significantly increases the risk of civil conflict, although this result should be interpreted with caution. The general conclusion of this study is that scarcity of natural resources has limited explanatory power in terms of civil violence, whereas poverty and dysfunctional institutions are robustly related to conflict. Future studies on the link between resource scarcity and violent conflict should focus on local and less intense conflicts, pay more attention to a context of low economic development, look more thoroughly into the role of state actors in the escalatory phase of conflict and assess the importance of the distribution of resources relative to scarcity per se. © 2008 Journal of Peace Research.",Not About Sufficiency

"Air quality and climate change co-benefits for the industrial sector in Durban, South Africa","Industries in Durban, South Africa, are a major source of air pollutant emissions and large users of fossil fuel based energy. Durban's energy strategy prioritises energy efficiency at industries as a key action, whilst industries are also the focus of the city's air quality management plan (AQMP). In this paper, measures that have been introduced in industries in Durban to effect air quality improvements and reduce energy consumption are examined in terms of their respective impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions. It was found that co-benefits for GHG mitigation were achieved when petroleum refineries switched from using heavy fuel oil to refinery gas and methane rich gas. Within other industries, co-benefits for air quality stemmed from reducing fossil fuel energy consumption and the improved efficiency of combustion systems. Air quality and energy policies in the city are being executed independently, without consideration of the trade-offs or synergies of the interventions being implemented. Recommendations are made for authorities and industries to consider the co-benefits for GHG mitigation in their AQMPs and where these are not possible to consider offsetting the increased GHG emissions through improved alignment with energy strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Microclimatic buffering on medicinal and aromatic plants: A review,"In recent years, the demand for herbs and aromatic products has increased worldwide in the herbal, flavor, and fragrance industry. Studies suggest that rapidly increasing anthropogenic activities have put a lot of pressure on energy and water use, especially in the dry land areas. To meet the burgeoning demand of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs), long-term use of agrochemicals and poor farming techniques reduced the quality of produce as per industrialist grade and can cause public health challenges and environmental pollution. Sustainable crops, higher productivity, and quality are typically assured by microclimate modification, which in turn contributes to sustainability and livelihood generation for people. Modification of climatic conditions in a relatively small area, at a height of 3–6 m over the surface of the earth, affect the growth and development of plants by altering different physical parameters such as light intensity and wavelength. Morphology, growth, yield, and secondary metabolites production in MAPs are affected by microclimate modification. These parameters influence plant photosynthesis which plays an important role in plant vegetative, reproductive, and developmental stages, yield, and secondary metabolite accumulation. Different crops behave differently to microclimate modifications. In some crops, shade levels significantly reduce the yield and quality of seed, while in some others, higher amount of light is required to enhance productivity and quality. Therefore, it is indispensable to evaluate the threshold light intensity to ensure the sustainable production of MAPs. This study provides an understanding of plant acclimation to light intensity from the vegetative phase to the reproductive phase of the MAPs. So, from the current study we have concluded that in the climate change era and as per the need of the herbs, aromatic products and perfumery industry, substitution of synthetic fertilizers and poor agronomic techniques with microclimate modification can be considered to enhance the quality of products. This technique can be recommended to industrialist and farmers as sustainable culture techniques by eliminating the additional need of chemical fertilizers, however, more studies are required to fill the information gaps with morphology, physiology, quality and soil properties of MAPs in different light conditions along with other agronomic techniques. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency

"Evaluating performance of traditional surface irrigation techniques in Cheleleka watershed in Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia","Unpredictability by local farmers, insufficiency and seasonality of rainfall have severely affected productivity of rain-fed agriculture in Cheleleka watershed. Thus, irrigated agriculture has a paramount role in lifesaving and insuring food security. Mismanagement of irrigation water influences agricultural productivity and efficiency of water uses. This study aimed to assess performance and potential of traditional surface irrigation schemes and to survey conflicts resulting from irrigation water use and management. Three major rivers in Cheleleka watershed (Wesha, Worka and Wodesa) where traditional irrigation has been widely practiced were selected purposively. The irrigable areas of each river were identified and categorized into upper, middle and lower parts based on its related location in the watershed. The soil samples, infiltration rate, long time meteorology, conveyance efficiency, irrigable areas and discharge at diversion points were analyzed. In addition, 49 households in irrigable areas of the three rivers were interviewed and three focus group discussions were held. About 0.16 and 0.14 m3/s of discharge were recorded in irrigation areas of the middle Wodesa and upper Worka rivers, respectively. The conveyance efficiency of the traditional surface irrigation canals at middle Wodesa and upper Wesha and Worka was less than 50%. The general potentials of surface irrigation water across the three perennial rivers were greater than 23 million cubic meters per year. The moisture stored in root zone or readily available water in existing farmers’ practices was found far beyond the carrying capacity of the soils, especially in middle Wodesa and upper Wesha and Worka areas. Performances of the traditional surface irrigation schemes are very low and had aggravated irrigation water losses and contributed to crop water scarcity and conflicts. The results also showed that farmers in the upper parts of the area and close to the diversion points excessively irrigate the cropland, whereas those far away and in lower watersheds of each river receive irrigation water insufficiently and irregularly. Even though there was irrigation management system/committee, the set principle was not respected. © 2018, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

The role of land degradation in the agriculture and environment nexus,"The relationship between agriculture and environment could be viewed as conflicting (win-lose) or as synergistic (win-win). A win-lose situation is occurring when agricultural activities such as clearing forest for cultivation is leading to environmental degradation or when environmental protection prevents agricultural activity. A synergistic approach, on the other hand, assumes that sustainable environmental management and agricultural production can be achieved simultaneously. One central goal of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and UNEP is to mainstream sustainable land management into sectors such as agriculture and forestry, thus assuming that win-win situations are possible. The different conceptual frameworks that UNEP has applied and developed in its GEF-funded land degradation projects highlight different aspects of the relationship between agriculture and environment. The paper draws on 10 years of UNEP/GEF experience in working at the environment-agriculture nexus starting with the People, Land Management and Environmental Change Project (PLEC). PLEC illustrates the potential for synergies between environmental and developmental objectives by developing sustainable and participatory approaches to biodiversity management and conservation based on farmers’ technologies and knowledge within agricultural systems. The Land Use Change, Impacts and Dynamics Project (LUCID) developed a model on how to use land use change analysis in combination with social and economic variables as a tool to assess biodiversity loss and land degradation across landscapes. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) assessment framework offers a mechanism for decision-makers to: (1) identify options that can better achieve core human development and sustainability goals; and (2) better understand the trade-offs involved in decisions concerning the environment. The Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands (LADA) uses the Driving Forces-Pressures-State-Impact-Responses (DPSIR) framework in analysing the environment-agriculture nexus in drylands. This overview shows how the relationship between agriculture and environment can be analysed using different models and approaches depending of scale and level of analysis. The PLEC model is useful at the local level in reconciling environmental and livelihood goals. Land use change analysis is a useful tool at the landscape level in analysing drivers of land degradation and biodiversity loss. The ecosystem services approach by the MA provides a tool for decision-makers at national level to make informed decisions about trade-offs between agriculture/human well-being and the environment. Finally, LADA will use the DPSIR framework for integration of information collected at different scales, from the local to the global. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Not About Sufficiency
"The association between ambient air pollution and allergic rhinitis: Further epidemiological evidence from Changchun, Northeastern China","With the continuous rapid urbanization process over the last three decades, outdoors air pollution has become a progressively more serious public health hazard in China. To investigate the possible associations, lag effects and seasonal differences of urban air quality on respiratory health (allergic rhinitis) in Changchun, a city in Northeastern China, we carried out a time-series analysis of the incidents of allergic rhinitis (AR) from 2013 to 2015. Environmental monitoring showed that PM2.5 and PM10 were the major air pollutants in Changchun, followed by SO2, NO2 and O3. The results also demonstrated that the daily concentrations of air pollutants had obvious seasonal differences. PM10 had higher daily mean concentrations in spring (May, dust storms), autumn (October, straw burning) and winter (November to April, coal burning). The mean daily number of outpatient AR visits in the warm season was higher than in the cold season. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis was significantly associated with PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2, and the increased mobility was 10.2% (95% CI, 5.5%–15.1%), 4.9% (95% CI, 0.8%–9.2%), 8.5% (95% CI, −1.8%–19.8%) and 11.1% (95% CI, 5.8%–16.5%) for exposure to each 1-Standard Deviation (1-SD) increase of pollutant, respectively. Weakly or no significant associations were observed for CO and O3. As for lag effects, the highest Relative Risks (RRs) of AR from SO2, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 were on the same day, and the highest RR from CO was on day 4 (L4). The results also indicated that the concentration of air pollutants might contribute to the development of AR. To summarize, this study provides further evidence of the significant association between ambient particulate pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10, which are usually present in high concentrations) and the prevalence of respiratory effects (allergic rhinitis) in the city of Changchun, located in Northeastern China. Environmental control and public health strategies should be enforced to address this increasingly challenging problem. © 2017 by the authors.

Determination of Land Degradation in Romania at a Local Scale Using Advanced Analytical Techniques,"Land degradation (LD) threatens the food security and general welfare of many people globally. Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is a pivotal goal within the global sustainability agenda, particularly under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3.1, which measures the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area. Romania, with its diverse landscapes and significant agricultural sector, faces notable challenges in this area. Assessing this SDG indicator serves to identify vulnerable areas and assists policymakers in defining the necessary strategic instruments and actions. Most previous studies have assessed land degradation using low- or moderate-resolution data without clearly identifying the triggering factors, thereby limiting the ability to detect changes at the sub-national level and analyze in detail the influence of these factors on the environment. This research is the first to examine the relationship between the proportion of land that is degraded and 20 potential triggering factors in cities and municipalities, aiming to identify key drivers of land degradation and provide insights for urban planning and policy-making. The study integrates a series of high and medium-resolution statistical, geospatial, and EO data sources to effectively assess land degradation and identify triggering factors in 103 municipalities and 216 cities. Using multiple regression analysis (MRA) and the Random Forest Method (RF), this study analyzed various predictive factors influencing LD, revealing that changes in land cover, temperature, and multi-annual average precipitation, along with atmospheric pollutants (CO, SO2) and Land Surface Temperature, significantly contribute to land degradation in large cities. These factors accounted for approximately 83.3% (MRA) and 96.7% (RF) of the variation in the land degradation indicator, underscoring their roles in influencing land degradation trends. According to the results, 2.3% of Romania's area was degraded during the 2015–2022 period, 58% remained stable, 38% showed improvements, and the remaining 1.7% represented water bodies. By identifying vulnerable communes and counties, and the triggering factors, the study supports the implementation of appropriate measures to combat LD, a crucial step in Romania's efforts to achieve LDN by 2030. © 2024 The Author(s).

Agricultural productivity in the WANA region,"The interest of governments, international organizations, NGOs and the general public has recently been aroused by studies considering the use of existing agricultural technology, the use of innovations in such technology and the production of agricultural goods. The attention received by such studies has grown as a result of an unprecedented wave of trade liberalization in the world (involving bilateral, regional and multilateral tradeintegration processes), coupled with concerns over food security, high rates of population growth and the use of limited and frequently degraded natural resources. In this context, the Malmquist Index, used to measure agricultural productivity, is a powerful tool, providing insights into whether or not a country is approaching what may be termed ""best practice"" by using and disseminating existing technology (efficiency change), and/or by innovating technology (technical change). Using the Malmquist Index on a sample of 12 countries within West Asia and North Africa (WANA) indicated that, between 1961 and 1997, Turkey, Tunisia, Syria and Algeria (in that order) were the ""most productive"" countries. Following them, in terms of agricultural productivity, were Iran, Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, while Pakistan, Sudan, Yemen and Ethiopia were the ""least productive"" countries of the 12 considered. Recurring negative results, with respect to both technical change and efficiency change, in Ethiopia, Sudan, Pakistan and Yemen, suggest that governments and national and international organizations and research institutions should make greater efforts to strengthen agricultural research and extension services if food security and competitiveness are to be improved. © City University of Hong Kong.",Not About Sufficiency
"Impact of climatic variabilities and extreme incidences on the physical environment, public health, and people’s livelihoods in Ethiopia","Ethiopia’s vulnerability to climate change is exacerbated by high poverty rates, rapid population growth, increasing prevalence of vector-borne diseases, and heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture. This narrative review aims to compile existing data on the impacts of climate extremes on the physical environment, public health, and livelihoods in Ethiopia, thereby highlighting the significance of this region for such a study. Data were sourced from peer-reviewed journal articles from databases like PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, as well as reports and other unpublished documents. Results show that Ethiopia is facing increasing frequency, severity, duration, and timing of climate-related extreme events. Key challenges include environmental degradation, reduced crop yields, recurring floods, droughts, famines, increased heat waves, and spread of infectious diseases. Average daily rainfall is projected to decrease from 2.04 mm (1961–1990) to 1.97 mm (2070–2099), indicating a worsening climate trend. Moreover, the average annual temperature has risen by 1.3°C since 1960, at a rate of 0.28°C per decade. Flood records indicate a sharp rise, with 274 flood incidents recorded in 2020, causing extensive damage, including an annual soil loss of 1 billion tons in the Ethiopian highlands, reducing land productivity by 2.2% annually. Droughts from 1964 to 2023 affected 96.5 million people, reduced GDP by 4%, decreased agricultural output by 12%, and increased inflation rates by 15%. The regions of Afar, Somali, Gambella, and Benshangul Gumuz exhibit extreme vulnerability to health impacts due to rising temperatures. Addressing climate extremes is critical to mitigate their adverse effects on Ethiopia’s environment, public health, and livelihoods. Copyright © 2024 Teku and Eshetu.",Not About Sufficiency
Effectiveness of Climate-Smart Agriculture Innovations in Smallholder Agriculture System in Ethiopia,"The scientific basis for conceptualizing how farm households achieve the three climate-smart agriculture (CSA) pillars, the “triple benefit”, is not well developed. This paper examined the impacts of CSA innovations on simultaneously enhancing food security, climate adaptation, and reducing GHG emissions. A cross-sectional household survey was collected from a multi-stage sample of 424 smallholder farmers selected from five agroecosystems of the upper Blue Nile highlands in Ethiopia and analyzed using an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model. CSA innovations, improved variety, compost, row planting, and agroforestry, provide farmers with the benefits of enhanced food security and climate change adaptation, reducing GHG emissions from farm plots. Crop rotation provides farmers with enhanced food security and reduced livelihood vulnerability, while SWC meets the goal of enhancing food security and reducing GHG emissions. Unfortunately, adopting crop residue management, one of the recommended CSA practices in Ethiopia, does not deliver at least two of the CSA pillars. Farmers should be encouraged to adopt improved variety, crop rotation, compost, row planting, soil and water conservation, and agroforestry as the best portfolio of CSA innovation for highland smallholder agriculture systems. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Impact of wild solanaceae rootstocks on morphological and physiological response, yield, and fruit quality of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) grown under deficit irrigation conditions","It has been established that climate change has a direct impact on water availability, an essential resource for agricultural development. As a result, controlling, mitigating, and adapting to water deficit requires the advancement of research on promising wild flora species. As recent studies have shown, wild relatives of certain cultivars are tolerant to adverse factors, enabling the development of sustainable and resilient agriculture. The present study evaluated the morpho-physiology and productivity of tomato scions grafted on wild Solanaceae (Datura stramonium, Solanum sisymbriifolium, Solanum quitoense, and Cyphomandra betacea) grown under water deficit conditions (100% ETc - high level, 75% ETc - moderate level, 50% ETc - medium level, and 25% ETc - low level). The results showed that tomato plants grafted on Datura stramonium rootstocks performed better morpho-physiologically under deficit irrigation. The improved osmoregulation caused by a higher relative water content (98.49%) allowed the scion to be more tolerant to water stress. In addition, these scions showed high water potential during their phenological stages (vegetative −0.47 MPa, flowering −0.59 MPa, and production −0.64 MPa), as well as improved photosynthetic efficiency. The overall tolerance of the scion resulted in better yield (8.14 kg/plant) with higher number of commercially valuable fruits. The D. stramonium rootstock allowed better management and use of irrigation water, increasing productivity (54.95 kg/m3); that is, it is presented as a species with potential for establishing tomato production areas in scenarios of water scarcity or cultivation under deficit irrigation. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"The complex relationship between asset wealth, adaptation, and diversification in tropical fisheries","Marine small-scale fisheries are complex social and ecological systems that are currently pressurised by climate change, increasing demand for food, and expectation to sustain livelihoods. Species diversification and occupational diversification are often offered as adaptation strategies to increase the resilience of these fisheries to natural and economic shocks. However, little is known about the nature of species diversification within marine tropical fisheries. Based on 293 interviews with artisanal fishers from six coastal communities located at the isles of Zanzibar, Pemba, Mafia, and Mainland Tanga in Tanzania - we assess if fishers with the highest level of species diversification are the most financially secure and able to adapt to changes in the fishing industry. By creating an Asset Wealth Index (AWI) based on a Multiple Correspondence Approach (MCA), we investigate the relative levels of adaptive capacity and fishery connectivity within the different regional wealth quartiles. We find that less wealthy fishers target fewer species, making them less able to absorb changes in management measures focused on species, area, and closures. Likewise, fishers with higher wealth scores and higher adaptive capacity are able to better absorb the short-term losses of fisheries closures when compared to those with lower wealth and adaptive scores reliant on higher levels of fishery connectivity. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Willingness to Pay for Ancillary Water Service Improvements in Puerto Rico,"Water scarcity impedes economic development and can be expensive or infeasible to resolve in many developing countries with recurring water service outages. In such circumstances, water supply organizations may be able to improve ancillary water service attributes to alleviate the burden of service interruptions. We use a discrete choice experiment to estimate households' willingness to pay (WTP) for improved water quality, coordinated scheduling of planned service interruptions, water use restrictions, and improved dissemination of information about upcoming service interruptions in Puerto Rico. The results indicate that households' WTP varies considerably across attributes and is greatest ( 28/month per household) for ensuring adequate water quality. Preferences for water service improvements vary across geographic locations and latent user groups. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Not About Sufficiency
A perspective from India on treated wastewater reuse: Few case studies,"In Indian industries, the wastewater reclaim-reuse-recycle practice has been prevalent since the last two decades due to acute water shortage as well as high cost of freshwater supply. This paper presents case studies of water reclamation projects in the textiles processing, automobiles, chemicals, and fertilizers industries, and the municipal sector where the author was involved. Reclamation requires affordable wastewater treatment and its hazard free sustained reuse. The Indian Reuse and Discharge Standards were revised upwards in April/May 2018 by the National Green Tribunal for the whole country with wide implications on the choice of treatment strategies, processes, and technology. This paper showcases the water reclamation plants in India. A 15 MLD textile processing ETP of Trident Group reclaims 10 MLD water, a 23 MLD STP of RCF Trombay recycles 16 MLD water; another 1.5 MLD auto industry ETP of Mahindra & Mahindra at Nashik recycles the whole quantity for non-potable reuse. The process and design engineers had to develop robust, consistent, and cost-effective process regimes including advanced bio-oxidation and membrane based processes like ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis followed by UV for disinfection. The wastewater characterization, selection of technology, and design of process units and project realization for water reclamation was a very rewarding experience. A few water reclamation cases from India are presented to showcase the successful management of challenges of water scarcity. © ASCE.",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of the world bank and international monetary fund on African sustainability and growth in the era of globalization,"This chapter by Billie Dee Tate deals with poverty as the scourge of a civilized society. He probes the following questions: What comes to mind when one tries to define abject poverty? Do we think about starvation? Do we think about contaminated water sources? Does the lack of adequate healthcare and access to free education constitute poverty? Who defines poverty? Is it the government's responsibility to address poverty or the perpetual suffering of the people? Does governmental policies and fiscal ineptness cause poverty? Is poverty the result of systematic policies instituted through the evils of colonialism, imperialism, and Western capitalist institutions and policies? He then proffers that one has to wonder how the African continent which holds much of the world's natural resources has the highest levels of poverty and despair. Africa and perpetual poverty, he posits, seem to go hand-in-hand and are interwoven in virtually all aspects of everyday life for most Africans. Consequently, he points out, Africa constitutes the majority of the world's poorest population. © The Author(s) 2020. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Time Series Models for Air Pollution Modelling Considering the Shift to Natural Gas in a Turkish City,"Fossil fuel utilization for residential heating is still a major source of fine particulate matter (PM10) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), despite the increasing consumption of natural gas in some cities in Turkey. In the present study, PM10 and SO2 air pollution and residential natural gas consumption (RNGC) were modelled by various multi-parameter time series modelling methods (TSMs). To estimate short-term pollution levels considering the future estimates of RNGC and meteorological factors, a time series dataset was designed for the years 2007-2013. Factor analysis was also performed to aid in the selection of variables for constructing TSMs. The error measures and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate forecasting accuracy of the models constructed. In the short-term estimation of RNGC, PM10, and SO2 for 2014-2015, temperature dependent ARIMAX(1,1,2) (R2=0.944) and RNGC and meteorological factors dependent SARIMAX(0,1,1)(1,1,0)12 (R2=0.761) and ARIMAX(1,1,0) (R2=0.698) models, respectively, yielded the best fitting scores and accuracy measures. The models performed well in reflecting the time series data and thus, could be utilized in energy planning for sustainable development concerning environmental decision making and short-term air quality forecasting for public health. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Urban environmental history,"Urban environmental history is a new subfield that evolved out of the linking of urban history and environmental history.1 In its simplest form, it concerns the character of the urban environment and the environmental phenomena occurring in cities. Cities historically have grown and expanded over time, developing expansive metropolitan areas and intensive relationships with their hinterlands. Some cities have also experienced substantial decline, especially during the past few decades. Both growth and decline have had sweeping environmental effects. The city's ecological footprint extends not only into its contiguous hinterland but can also leap hundreds and even thousands of miles through trade and communications.2 The extent of these impacts depends on a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. Among the critical natural ones are climate, wind patterns, topography, soil characteristics, and hydrology. Anthropogenic factors include population growth, territorial expansion, industrial development and deindustrialization, changing energy and resource use, and construction of a built environment. All of these factors are affected by the actions of individuals, groups, corporations, and governments pursuing various ends, including economic growth, land development, and the acquisition of power. The actual events that impacted the environment, either negative or positive, include both purposeful actions and unintended effects. Factors such as threats to the public health, various nuisances (including water, air, and land pollution), depletion of natu- ral resources, as well as major natural events drove public attention to urban environmental considerations. The identification of significant turning points depends on such elements as changes in technology and land use, value preferences, theories of disease etiology, the perception of risk held by urban elites and the general population, the costs of change or remediation, and public policies that caused or mitigated environmental problems.3 The turning points and events identified here relate primarily to the environmental history of U.S. cities but similar factors have driven change in Europe, especially in the more industrialized nations, albeit at a somewhat different pace and occasionally with different outcomes.4 American urban history itself can be divided into four overlapping periods. These periods are those of the compact walking city (c. 1790-1870); the industrializing networked city (c. 1870-1920); the development of metropolitan areas (c. 1920-1970); and the era of spreading and splintering urbanization (c. 1970-2000). These are not fixed or absolute time periods; rather, they conform largely to the changing spatial and economic character of cities shaped primarily by economic development, public and private infrastructure construction, and transportation and communications technologies. In each period it is possible to identify distinctive environmental patterns. Cities often faced similar issues revolving around the need to meet their requirements for water, clean air, land, materials, and energy in the context of population, spatial, and economic growth. However, the extent to which problems were solved or mitigated, or even received consideration from a policy perspective, varied sharply from period to period.

The role of ecosystem services within safe and just operating space at the regional scale,"Context: The Regional Safe and Just Operating Space (RSJOS), serving as a conceptual framework that supports environmental governance and policy formulation, has garnered growing recognition. However, the application of ecosystem services in the RSJOS framework still constitutes a knowledge gap in the realm of landscape sustainability science. Objectives: Our objective was to discuss the role of ecosystem services within the Safe and Just Operating Space (SJOS) framework to promote regional sustainability. Methods: We analyzed the relationship between ecosystem services and the SJOS framework, including their similarities in core concepts and research objectives, as well as how ecosystem services relate to environmental ceilings and social foundations. Based on these analyses, we discussed the potential and challenges of bridging safe space and just space using an ecosystem services approach. Results: We found that ecosystem services have the potential to help understand the interaction between ecological ceilings and social foundations when assessing RSJOS, using ecosystem service flows to link “safe” and “just” boundaries. However, challenges in applying ecosystem services to assess RSJOS can limit the benefits of this framework. Conclusions: The examination of RSJOS should extend beyond snapshots of the current regional state and encompass their inherent interconnections and impact mechanisms. This broader perspective can subsequently inform policy decisions. Ecosystem services play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges within the RSJOS framework. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the effects of highly conductive carbon fiber composites on evaporation and desalination rates of salt water,"Water scarcity is a growing problem for large regions of the world because of insufficient sources of fresh water to meet the demands. It is estimated that 2.8 billion people around the world have at least one month of clean water shortages, whereas, approximately 1.2 billion people lack access to clean drinking water worldwide. It is believed that fresh water problem can be addressed using effective desalination process in a cost effective manner. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the increase in the evaporation rate via thermally and electrically conductive carbon fiber composites during the desalination process. Analysis of the evaporation rate along with the rise in temperature and decrease in weight was carried out using light sources under similar environmental conditions at different heights and salt concentrations.

"Gender Roles, Implications for Water, Land, and Food Security in a Changing Climate: A Systematic Review","Water and land are vital resources essential to ensuring sustainable and productive rural economies. They are also essential for safeguarding food security and socio-economic development. In spite of this, the concept of water-land-food (WLF) security nexus has generally been examined from a top-down manner with women mostly disenfranchised in the access and management of water and land in particular. Concurrently, risks linked with climate crisis aggravate gender inequalities. The limited access to resources, restricted formal rights through top-down management exacerbates the vulnerability of poor rural women. Furthermore, policy development procedures follow a sectoral approach with no account of interrelationship and interdependence between the sectors. This, directly and indirectly limits the stewardship of natural resources and mitigation of the effects of climate change. This study, therefore, examines gender roles and their implications for water, land, and food security in a changing climate through an integrative systematic review of literature in Sub-Saharan Africa. It further explains the importance to consider the nexus in adaptation. Food security and sustainable livelihoods could be ensured if women can freely and adequately access land and participate in decision-making processes. © Copyright © 2021 Tantoh, McKay, Donkor and Simatele.",Not About Sufficiency
INSECT POLLINATION: AN INCREDIBLE NATURAL SERVICE FOR FOOD SUSTAINABILITY IN AGROECOSYSTEMS-A REVIEW,"Insect pollination plays a pivotal role in the reproductive success of many flowering plants, essential for maintaining biodiversity and ensuring food security in agroecosystems. While plants rely on various pollinators, insects are the primary contributors to this natural service, transferring pollen as they forage for nectar and pollen rewards. This mutualistic interaction between plants and pollinators is crucial for the sustainability of both natural and agricultural ecosystems. However, the increasing threat to pollinators from habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change jeopardizes this vital ecosystem service. The decline in pollinator populations is particularly concerning for global food security, as many crops depend on insect-mediated pollination. This review examines the mechanisms of insect pollination, the factors contributing to pollinator decline, and strategies to enhance pollinator populations. Emphasis is placed on the importance of conserving native pollinators, optimizing agricultural practices, and mitigating environmental stressors to sustain pollination services for future generations. © 2024, Punjab Agricultural University.

Creative cocktails or toxic brews? Blended finance and the regulatory framework for sustainable development,"Blended finance is the new catchphrase in international development cooperation. Referring broadly to financial instruments that combine public and philanthropic resources with private capital to support development and global public policy objectives, blended finance is deployed ostensibly to catalyse greater private capital flows to emerging and so-called ‘frontier’ markets through the public provision of financial incentives, such as subsidized loans, risk guarantees and co-financing, to private actors investing in developing countries. Proponents argue that blended finance is crucial to scaling up resources for sustainable development projects, including in agriculture, energy and climate change mitigation and adaptation, by mitigating risks, by lowering transaction costs and thereby increasing the commercial viability of such investments for private actors. This chapter examines the emergence of blended finance as mechanism for financing development and its implications for the international aid architecture and framework for international development cooperation. It argues that the growth of new public-private modalities of development financing, such as blended finance, is re-engineering the governance of international public finance at the global and domestic levels, involving a significant shift in the forms of public administration and governance in which crucial elements of public authority are being shared with a host of non-governmental and other-governmental actors. This increasing shift towards the so-called ‘privatization of aid’ necessarily entails a transformation in the modalities of public administration to accommodate these new forms of public goods provision and account for the new exercises of public authority by third party private actors. This, in turn, has implications for both the substantive outcomes of international development cooperation, such as food security, poverty reduction and environmental protection, and the governance and regulatory framework of international development cooperation that is crucial not only to the delivery of such outcomes, but to safeguarding the interests of stakeholders of sustainable development investments. © The editors and contributors severally 2019.

Triple-crises-induced food insecurity: systematic understanding and resilience building approaches in Africa,"The triple crises of the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict and climate change have severely impacted food systems, leading to socio-economic consequences and undermining food and nutrition security across Africa. To address the malnutrition and poverty affecting approximately 700 million people in Africa, there is potential for the One Health approach implementation and operationalization to bring together multidisciplinary solutions for tackling food insecurity and ensuring food safety net. However, there is limited documentation on the potential of the One Health approach system thinking implementation to guide responses to triple crises-induced food insecurity. Therefore, this article aims to systematically understand the triple crises-induced food insecurity, connect existing solutions, and explore the role of the One Health approach in strengthening food and agriculture systems in Africa. Our finding showed the impact of triple crises exacerbating food system vulnerability in Africa and worldwide. Mitigating and resilient actions are urgently needed in tackling the emerging and persisting challenges, and infectious diseases menace and burden across Africa. We present a conceptual model illustrating the complex nature of triple crises-induced food insecurity, vulnerability areas within the food system, and actionable strategies for building community food resilience. Additionally, recommendations are provided to create an enabling environment that supports One Health approach implementation and addresses food insecurity challenges through innovative partnerships, local-led initiatives, and enhanced governance and artificial intelligence technology capacities in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth to reduce socio-economic inequalities. Stepping up integrated, actionable, and sustainable food systems programs and innovative long-lasting solutions requires investing in promoting new partnership and research collaboration in building conflict resolution and peace towards strengthening and reshaping local and global food security related climate change adaptations actions for most vulnerable communities’ benefits.

Feed-in tariff and tradable green certificate in oligopoly,"Feed-in tariff (FIT) and tradable green certificate (TGC) schemes are studied in a formal model and numerical example using the UK data. We find that if the markets were perfectly competitive, then feed-in tariff and the certificate price would be the same. However, when the markets are imperfect, they are generally different. While both the tariff and certificate price fluctuate around the difference between the costs of green and black energy, the tariff deviates more from the cost difference than the certificate price. The supplies of both black and green energy under FIT are higher than TGC, obviously as a result of subsidies. A troubling outcome is that the total energy supply increases under FIT as the renewables quota increases, which can negate other measures to mitigate climate changes such as demand management. Finally, using the data from the UK market, we find that social welfare under TGC is consistently higher than FIT for a wide range of values of the parameters. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

However, the sector has many challenges, which have increased the call for an integrated approach that provides links among human needs, activities, changes in the state of the environment, and the resultant effect on ecosystem services for sustainable management in fulfilment of the Conservation on Biological Diversity and the Sustainable Development Goals. This study uses a socio-ecological framework (Drivers (D), Activities (A), Pressure (P), State (S), Impact (I) on welfare (W), and Response (R) as a Measure (M); DAPSI(W)R(M)) to assess the marine fishery sector of Ghana. Data were systematically sampled and analysed from vessel logbooks, fish manifests, observer reports, and relevant publications. Results show that Drivers, including livelihoods and revenue, food, and social status, contribute to industrial tuna and trawl fishing, and marine artisanal fishing activities. Where illegal fishing methods such as small mesh-size nets (less than 25 mm), lights, poisonous substances, among others, are used. These activities have contributed to the pressures of selective fishing of juvenile and adult pelagic and demersal fish species. This has contributed to (changes in the State) the decline and vulnerability of Sardinella spp., and Engraulis encrasicolus, among others. The Impact on welfare includes Ghana becoming a net importer of marine species with increasing idleness of fishers due to reduced catch. Several management measures, including the Fisheries Act 625 of 2002 and Fisheries (Amendment) Regulations L.I. 2217 of 2015, and quotas in the tuna sector, among others, have been instituted to curb the effect of anthropogenic activities. Management measures, including influencing consumer behaviour for a sustainable fishery, enforcement, and data-driven management, have been recommended, in response to the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations Decade of Ocean and the Convention on Biological Diversity. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Accidental Deviation by Natural Disaster-Prone Countries on Renegotiation-Proof Climate Change Agreements,"This study provides a new framework for international environmental agreements (IEAs), which include punishment exceptions for accidental deviation, using repeated games. We consider that deviation from an agreement can occur accidentally because of phenomena such as natural disasters, even if the agreement is sustained as a weakly renegotiation-proof equilibrium. If an IEA signatory deviates accidentally, it fails to achieve its emission abatement target. In the repeated game, a cooperative relationship among signatories is sustained by a strategy that prescribes rules of cooperation and punishment for deviation. We present a new strategy, called Regional Cooperative, which integrates accidental deviations into an IEA. Our model reveals that punishing countries tend to revoke the punishment of deviators and return to cooperation if an accidental deviator increases its abatement volume. That is, the abatement efforts of the accidental deviator can lead to renegotiation. The Regional Cooperative strategy motivates the accidental deviator to try to engage in abatement and the punishing countries to restart cooperation by renegotiation. We conclude that social welfare loss by punishment is prevented through renegotiation in cases of accidental deviation. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
"When defining boundaries for nexus analysis, let the data speak","A policy and research agenda has emerged in recent years to understand the interconnected risks natural resource systems face and drive. The so-called ‘Food-Energy-Water’ (FEW) nexus has served as a focal point for the conceptual, theoretical and empirical development of this agenda. This special issue provides an opportunity to reflect on whether natural resource use, as viewed through the FEW-nexus lens, provides a useful basis for guiding integrated environmental management. Within this piece, we describe how the partiality of the FEW-nexus overlooks major pathways of resource use (i) within the food system and (ii) across the wider burden of human activity. As a result, we argue FEW-centric analysis is more likely to disguise rather than reveal key opportunities for integrated environmental management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
An economic analysis of water status in Jordan,"This study aims to describe and identify with some details the water status in Jordan, its sources and the various usages using selected econometric models. Variables for analysis will include rainfall, population, water distribution, water sources (surface, ground and treated and waste water) and also the various demands for water uses including from the municipal, industrial and agricultural sectors. Results of the analysis should give a clearer overview of the status in Jordan. It is hoped that the issues, the problems identified and discussed will also be useful to some other Middle Eastern countries or any country having similar water problems. Jordan, a small Arab country with population of about 5 million in the Middle East is one country that has very limited water supply for competing uses in agriculture and human consumption. In fact, Jordan is also poor of other natural resources such as oil. The water consumption per person in Jordan for household use is about 126.5 L day-1 in 2002, this figure will increase to 155 L day-1 by 2020, as a result of the higher living standard. The water sector in Jordan has witnessed many stages of development in spite of the many challenges it has to face particularly beginning the 1990s. Today, the problem is even more serious because of population increase, improved living standards and many other social and economic developments in the country. Water is now given a top priority by the Jordanian government due to its vital importance and in particular because it is a basic need for the survival and development of life, as well as the economic growth and development of Jordan. © 2010 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",Not About Sufficiency
REDD policy impacts on the agri-food sector and food security,"Recent research shows that the combined contributions of deforestation, forest degradation and peat land emissions account for about 15% of greenhouse gas emissions. The REDD policy which preserves forests and values standing forests, enables substantial emission reductions. Since agricultural production and area expansion is a primary driver of tropical deforestation, REDD policies might limit the expansion possibilities of agricultural land use and therefore influence competitiveness of the agricultural sector, agricultural prices, trade patterns, agricultural production and therefore food security in the world. This paper studies the impact of REDD policies on the agri-food sector and food security with a global CGE model called MAGNET using a scenario approach. It focuses on the restrictions on agricultural land expansion within the REDD policy package. Simulation results show that REDD policies start to affect the agri-food sector in some lower developed countries if more than 15% of potentially available agricultural areas are protected from deforestation. A stringent REDD policy that protects 90% of land reserves that could potentially be used for agriculture production results in a global real agricultural price increase of almost 7.6%, and a worldwide agricultural production decrease of 1.7%. Regional differences are large, with real agricultural price changes ranging from 4% in North America to about 24% in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. Food access rapidly deteriorates for low-income population in these regions in the case of high forest protection levels. Compensatory payments are necessary from a food security point of view if the level of forest protection increases. Our results indicate that from a food security perspective REDD policy should stop short of trying to protect more than 40% of global carbon if the compensation mechanism is not effectively implemented within REDD. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

MicroEnv: A microsimulation model for quantifying the impacts of environmental policies on population health and health inequalities,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognise the critical need to improve population health and environmental sustainability. This paper describes the development of a microsimulation model, MicroEnv, aimed at quantifying the impact of environmental exposures on health as an aid to selecting policies likely to have greatest benefit. Its methods allow the integration of morbidity and mortality outcomes and the generation of results at high spatial resolution. We illustrate its application to the assessment of the impact of air pollution on health in London. Simulations are performed at Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA), the smallest geographic unit (population of around 1500 inhabitants) for which detailed socio-demographic data are routinely available in the UK. The health of each individual in these LSOAs is simulated year-by-year using a health-state-transition model, where transition probabilities from one state to another are based on published statistics modified by relative risks that reflect the effect of environmental exposures. This is done through linkage of the simulated population in each LSOA with 1 × 1 km annual average PM2.5 concentrations and area-based deprivation indices. Air pollution is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally, and improving air quality is critical to the SDGs for Health (Goal 3) and Cities (Goal 11). The evidence of MicroEnv is aimed at providing better understanding of the benefits for population health and health inequalities of policy actions that affect exposure such as air quality, and thus to help shape policy decisions. Future work will extend the model to integrate other environmental determinants of health. © 2019",Not About Sufficiency
Global Reparations within Capitalism: Aspirations and Tensions in Contemporary Movements for Reparatory Justice,"The idea of global reparations has received increasing attention in recent years, not only with respect to legacies of slavery and colonialism, but also to interrelated issues such as climate change, debt crisis, or ongoing financial transfers from the Global South to the Global North. This article, which introduces and sets the Debate for the 2024 Forum issue on the political economy of 21st century global reparations, offers a critical perspective on contemporary global reparations agendas, including their macroeconomic and development implications for the Global South. It highlights the contentious, unresolved questions about how reparations movements should interact with the highly unequal structures of global capitalism. To what degree should they seek large redistributive gains within these structures, or else aim for more revolutionary standpoints which reject these structures? If the former, would this compromise any hope for reparations to be truly transformative and able to address the challenges presented by global white supremacy? The hope of reparations movements is to make progressive gains that could become the catalyst for more transformative changes on a global scale. At the same time, sympathetic critics question whether reparations are feasible or should be a primary focus of advocacy for achieving racial and climate justice on national as well as global levels. In outlining these points of debate, the article also considers the questions of how to make global reparations work for recipients, and how to finance them. It concludes by elaborating on the challenge of moving towards a more developmentalist emphasis of ‘systemic reparations’. © 2024 The Author(s).

Zero liquid discharge (ZLD) initiatives in natural gas processing plants in Qatar,"Emerging water regulations and fresh water scarcity are driving the natural gas processing industries in Qatar towards implementing Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) systems. ZLD implies that all wastewater produced in the plant is contained within the plant fence and treated industrial and process water (TIPW) is not discharged into the environment. This paper presents an evaluation of technologies, their potential effectiveness and challenges in achieving ZLD. Pre-treatment facilities for TIPW re-use generally consist of neutralisation and filtration packages, Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) strippers and Dissolved Air Floatation (DAF) and Membrane Biore- Actor (MBR) units. A combination of technologies such as Brine Concentrators, Ultrafiltration (UF), Reverse Osmosis (RO), evaporation-crystallisation unit, and other emerging technologies, are considered as viable solutions for ZLD. However, space limitations, capital expenditure, and concentrate management (brine disposal minimisation) are being recognised as significant obstacles for the existing plants. Deep well injections, evaporation ponds (and landfill disposal options) and discharge to the marine environment (with proper mixing) are the only feasible options for disposal of concentrated brine. With restrictive environmental permits and requirements for these disposal methods, industrial facilities find it difficult to economically justify a ZLD system. A combination of re-concentration techniques and a comprehensive utilisation of concentrated brine, with supportive governmental policies, would be one of the most effective ways to fulfill ZLD.

Learning from pandemics: Applying resilience thinking to identify priorities for planning urban settlements,"Based in an interdisciplinary review of the literature on COVID-19 and recent outbreaks, this paper uses pandemics as a lens to examine the socio-ecological resilience of human settlements. This narrative literature review applies the conceptual framework for resilience developed for complex systems to identify five planning and policy issues critical to disease emergence, transmission, and outbreak. First, since urban settlements and activities facilitate pathogen transmission between species, reducing 'shocks' like zoonotic diseases and climate change requires not just prioritizing urbanization patterns and land use in urban policies for environmental health, but also animal rearing practices and biodiversity maintenance. Second, since disease transmission is linked to not just contact rate but also host susceptibility, reducing vulnerability by improving equity in access to essential infrastructures like housing, water, sanitation, healthy food, green/public spaces, healthcare—that impact human health directly and indirectly—is critical. In its absence, curbing disease transmission requires focusing on contact rate suppression, but doing so brings human activity to a halt, decimating the economy and livelihoods. Third, the persistence of many pathogens or their vectors in environmental media suggests that built environment & public health professionals must address maintenance of environmental quality at various scales. Fourth, there is a need for redundancy, be it in commodity supply chains (like PPE, food) or data management for say, monitoring & enforcement of home quarantines during a pandemic. Fifth, while it is crucial to have a centralized response for healthcare, decentralized infrastructure management has been critical during this outbreak: including participatory governance structures to recruit civil society in data collection and self-reporting, reliance on and quick development of mutual aid groups to distribute food and other essential supplies, localized approaches to repurposing infrastructures to create safe public spaces. This application of resilience thinking also evokes the need to study cities as social-ecological systems. © 2021 The Author",Not About Sufficiency
Climate smart crop-livestock integrated farming as a sustainable agricultural strategy for humid tropical islands,"Climate change and its impacts on agriculture are relatively well documented at the global and regional levels, while adaptation measures to sustain food production are mostly location specific. Such measures integrated into a production system as a farming practice will become robust based on its performance at smallholder farms. Therefore, a long-term (2011-2018) study was undertaken to evaluate these practices in a crop-livestock integrated farming system (IFS) approach as a climate-smart agricultural (CSA) strategy for enhancing agricultural production on a humid tropical island. The results showed a significant increase in on-farm productivity from 2.8 t ha−1 in 2011–35.6 t ha−1 in 2018 and net returns from USD 359 to more than 3500 ha−1 due to the adoption of CSA practices. Most importantly the study found increase in the sustainability index (0.89) by the adoption of CSA practices such as crop and enterprise diversification and land manipulation. The climate smartness of these practices was witnessed in reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and expanded carbon sink that resulted in a mitigation benefit of 5.40 Mg CO2eq ha−1yr−1. CSA practices such as crop diversification through raised beds, enterprise diversification, crop rotation, green manuring, in-situ rainwater harvesting, and contingency cropping significantly contributed to enhancing the production of crop-livestock IFS. Crop residue mulching, agro-forestry and organic waste recycling contributed for enlarging the C sink and minimizing net GHG emissions. Based on these findings, we demonstrated that a crop-livestock IFS was the best climate-smart strategy to enhance the productivity and food security of smallholder farmers in a sustainable way against the consequences of climate change and to increase the mitigating potential through carbon stocking. © 2023 The Author(s).

Weedy rice and the sustainability of alternative establishment methods,"Given its dependence and influence on the environment, and its importance for food security, several initiatives aim to improve the sustainability of rice cultivation. The most widespread recommendation is a switch from hand transplanting to direct-seeding. In the short-term direct-seeding presents social, economic and ecological advantages, however it induces in the longer term a major problem, the proliferation of weeds, in particular of weedy rice. The latter lowers grain yield and quality, and therefore farmers' income. Since weedy rice is a conspecific of cultivated rice, then it is very difficult to control it by either traditional means or biotechnologically because it promotes crop-weed hybridisation and the introgression of traits such as herbicide resistance. In addition to their low effectiveness, these weed management methods imply in the long-term important economic and ecological costs that reduce, or even might cancel, the short-term benefits associated with the switch to direct-seeding. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Applying a sustainability perspective in the literature on physical therapy in relation to pharmaceuticals: a scoping review,"Introduction: Physical therapy encompasses a broad range of treatment options, often utilized in clinical settings where pharmaceutical interventions are standard. The potential for physical therapy to contribute to sustainable healthcare by reducing environmental impact, while maintaining the quality of care, remains underexplored. This study aimed to map existing research comparing physical therapy to pharmaceuticals, with a specific focus on whether these studies address aspects of sustainable development. Methods: A scoping review was conducted, systematically searching the PubMed, Cinahl, and Pedro databases using keywords related to physical therapy, pharmaceuticals, and comparative studies. Two assessors independently reviewed and selected relevant studies, followed by data extraction and summarization of results. Results: A total of 27 studies were included, varying in design, population, and healthcare context. The most commonly addressed conditions were osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal pain, with analgesics being the most frequently studied pharmaceutical interventions. While several studies touched upon economic and social dimensions of sustainable development, none examined environmental sustainability. This highlights a critical gap in current research. Discussion: Future studies are needed to assess how physical therapy, when compared to pharmaceutical treatments, can contribute to sustainable healthcare by offering a low-carbon, resource-efficient alternative without compromising social sustainability through adverse effects. This knowledge could be instrumental in guiding healthcare systems toward more sustainable practices.

Space matters: Exploring problematic spatial issues in the valuation of ecosystem services,"This chapter touches on several spatial dimensions associated with the economic valuation of ecosystem services and explores one case study associated with the storm protection services provided by coastal wetlands. Making a defensible estimate of the economic value of the storm protection services of a particular coastal wetland will necessarily mandate the inclusion of spatial context in the assessment. Some spatially relevant information needed to make this assessment is: (1) How frequently does this part of the world experience storms? (2) How much built capital is located near enough to these wetlands to be protected by them? Establishing a spatial perspective in the assessment of ecosystem service valuation is also explored in a global study of impervious surface area (ISA) and net primary productivity (NPP). Human well-being is improved by the interaction of social, built, human and natural capital. It has been argued that it is essential to adopt a spatially explicit approach to the valuation of ecosystem services in order to improve the characterization of this interaction (Eade and Moran, 1996). The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA, 2005) undoubtedly raised awareness of the importance of ecosystem services to the survival of the human race. Assessing the nature and value of natural capital and ecosystem services involves methods often associated with the transdisciplinary field of research often referred to as ecological economics (Daly and Farley, 2004). © K.N.

Green growth beliefs: Investigating factors associated with expert opinions on green growth,"Green growth attempts to achieve sustainable development under continued economic growth and is currently one of the leading policy responses to mitigate climate change and prevent environmental collapse. We surveyed 3,028 academics in 101 countries on its feasibility and found strong divergence in endorsement, with 59% endorsing green growth. We identify various factors associated with beliefs about the feasibility of green growth, extending beyond prior survey studies on academic expert opinions regarding green growth. The strongest factor associated with green growth endorsement is the belief that ongoing economic growth is crucial for human well-being. The findings highlight the continued importance for a solid empirical assessment of expert views on green growth. © 2025 Suter et al.

Integrated System Dynamics Modelling for water scarcity assessment: Case study of the Kairouan region,"A System Dynamics Model (SDM) assessing water scarcity and potential impacts of socio-economic policies in a complex hydrological system is developed. The model, simulating water resources deriving from numerous catchment sources and demand from four sectors (domestic, industrial, agricultural, external pumping), contains multiple feedback loops and sub-models. The SDM is applied to the Merguellil catchment, Tunisia; the first time such an integrated model has been developed for the water scarce Kairouan region. The application represents an early step in filling a critical research gap. The focus of this paper is to a) assess the applicability of SDM for assessment of the evolution of a water-scarce catchment and b) to analyse the current and future behaviour of the catchment to evaluate water scarcity, focusing on understanding trends to inform policy. Baseline results indicate aquifer over-exploitation, agreeing with observed trends. If current policy and social behaviour continue, serious aquifer depletion is possible in the not too distant future, with implications for the economy and environment. This is unlikely to occur because policies preventing depletion will be implemented. Sensitivity tests were carried out to show which parameters most impacted aquifer behaviour. Results show non-linear model behaviour. Some tests showed negligible change in behaviour. Others showed unrealistic exponential changes in demand, revenue and aquifer water volume. Policy-realistic parameters giving the greatest positive impact on model behaviour were those controlling per-capita domestic water demand and the pumped volume to coastal cities. All potentially beneficial policy options should be considered, giving the best opportunity for preservation of Kairouan aquifer water quantity/quality, ecologically important habitats and the agricultural socio-economic driver of regional development. SDM is a useful tool for assessing the potential impacts of possible policy measures with respect to the evolution of water scarcity in critical regions.

Mapping connectivity and conservation opportunity on agricultural lands across the conterminous United States,"Depending on management practices, agricultural lands can either pose substantial barriers to species movement or can support landscape connectivity by linking areas of high-quality habitat. Balancing connectivity and sustainable food production on agricultural lands is critical to conservation in the conterminous United States (CONUS) where agriculture makes up close to half of total land area. However, limited guidance exists on where to target conservation resources to maximize benefits for native species and food security. To quantify the potential contribution of agricultural lands to the movement of organisms, we developed a novel method for estimating agricultural management intensity (based on remotely sensed temporal variation in vegetation cover) and incorporated these estimates into a CONUS-wide model of ecological flow connectivity. We combined our connectivity results with data on the productivity, versatility, and resilience of agricultural lands (PVR) to identify conservation opportunities that support both biodiversity and food production. The highest levels of connectivity on agricultural lands occurred on relatively unmodified rangelands and on cropland and pasture surrounded by large amounts of natural land cover. Mapping connectivity and PVR across CONUS revealed 10.2 Mha of agricultural lands (2.7 %) with high value for both connectivity and food production, as well as large amounts of agricultural land (>140 Mha in total) with high value for either cultivation or supporting biodiversity. Drawing on these findings, we provide recommendations on the types of conservation approaches most suitable for a given agricultural system and link these recommendations to specific government incentive programs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Urban Water Management and Public Acceptance of Rainwater Harvesting Systems: Insights from Young and Educated Respondents in Muslim Communities,"As water scarcity and environmental sustainability become increasingly critical global concerns, there is a growing need to identify alternative water resources. This study investigates public acceptance of Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) systems in Brunei Darussalam for non-potable uses and ablution purposes. Using an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework, the research evaluates key factors influencing public perceptions, including Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Attitude Towards Use (ATU), Intentions to Use (ITU), and external factors such as Perceived Cost (PC), Subjective Knowledge (SK), and Technical Requirements (TR). Survey data were analyzed through regression techniques to assess these relationships. The results validate the TAM framework for understanding acceptance of RWH systems and highlight strong positive relationships between PEU, PU, and ATU, with ATU emerging as the strongest predictor of behavioral intentions (ITU). External factors like PC and TR were identified as barriers to adoption, emphasizing the need for financial incentives and technical support. Additionally, subjective knowledge was found to positively influence PU and ITU, underscoring the importance of public awareness campaigns. While concerns about the safety and quality of recycled rainwater were present, they were not significant deterrents to acceptance. The findings also reveal broad support for initiatives such as education, technical guidance, and maintenance services to enhance adoption. Muslim respondents expressed positive attitudes toward using rainwater for ablution, aligning with religious principles of water conservation. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers and relevant agencies to promote RWH systems as a sustainable water management solution, aligning with global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and 13 (Climate Action). © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Alternating Partial Root-Zone Subsurface Drip Irrigation Enhances the Productivity and Water Use Efficiency of Alfalfa by Improving Root Characteristics,"Water scarcity is one of the significant constraints on sustainable agricultural development in arid and semi-arid regions. The challenges faced in forage production are even more severe than those encountered with general crops. The industry still struggles to achieve water-efficient, high-yield quality forage in water-scarce pastoral areas. This study focuses on alfalfa, a high-quality forage crop, employing a combination of “subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) + alternate partial root-zone irrigation (APRI)” and establishing three water supply gradients (full irrigation, 75% deficit, 50% deficit), in comparison with the widely used subsurface drip irrigation, to study the effects of two irrigation methods and three moisture gradients on alfalfa. The aim is to provide some theoretical basis and data support for achieving water-saving and high-yield quality forage in water-scarce pastoral areas. The main findings are as follows: First, compared with SDI, the two-year alternate dry and wet environment provided by alternate partial root-zone drip irrigation (ARDI) significantly increased the specific root length, specific surface area, and root length density of alfalfa at 20~40 cm depth, increasing by 33.3~76.8%, 6.4~32.97%, and 15.2~93.9%, respectively, compared to SDI. Under ARDI irrigation, the alfalfa root system has a greater contact area with the soil, which lays a solid foundation for the water and nutrient supply needed for the accumulation of its above-ground biomass. Secondly, over the two-year production process, the plant height of alfalfa under ARDI treatment was 12~14.5% higher than that under SDI, the total fresh forage yield was 43.5~64% higher, and the total dry forage yield was 23.2~33.8% higher than SDI. Under ARDI, the 75% water deficit treatment could still maintain the plant height and stem thickness of alfalfa compared to full irrigation with SDI and increased the dry forage yield by 6.6% without significantly reducing the quality, significantly enhancing the productive performance of alfalfa. Moreover, during the two years of production and utilization, the nutritional quality of alfalfa under the ARDI irrigation mode did not significantly decrease compared to SDI, maintaining the stable nutritional quality of alfalfa over multiple years of production. Lastly, thanks to the improved root system and increased yield of alfalfa under ARDI irrigation, and based on this, its water evapotranspiration did not significantly increase compared to SDI; the annual average Alfalfa Water Productivity Index (AWPI) and Alfalfa Water Productivity of Crop (AWPC) under ARDI irrigation increased by 28.8% and 37.2%, respectively, improving the water use efficiency of alfalfa production. In summary, in the production of alfalfa in water-scarce pastoral areas, ARDI and its water deficit treatment have more potential for water-saving than SDI as a water-saving irrigation strategy. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Does just transition increase social and environmental risks? Evidence from global port cities development,"With the acceleration of globalization, the role of ports in urban economic growth is becoming increasingly prominent. However, its traditional operating methods have also caused significant pressure on the environment, leading to worsening air pollution problems. Public concern for health and the environment has made transforming ports a top priority. Despite these measures, air and health indicators in some port cities have not improved significantly, and health conditions in some cities have even deteriorated. In addition, many academic explorations research on port cities has focused on reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gases, without systematically studying the social and environmental risks of just transition in port cities. Therefore, this article uses data from 10 port cities from 2013 to 2022, combined with multiple regression and Kuznets curve for in-depth analysis. The research found that in areas with high population density, the relationship between port transformation and Air Quality Index(AQI) forms an inverted N-shaped curve, while in areas with low population density, it is an n-shaped curve. This reveals the non-linear impact of port transformation on air pollution. From a health perspective, the just transition of ports has always been beneficial for the health of urban residents, especially in areas with high population density. This means that the impact of the transformation of ports on the environment and on health depends not only on the depth of the transformation, but also on regional characteristics. This study focused on how the transition could improve air quality, and the study also delved into its long-term impact on the health of city residents. This provides valuable information for the development of sustainable strategies in port cities, helping them to more effectively improve their environmental and health conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Changes in per capita wheat production in China in the context of climate change and population growth,"To address challenges associated with climate change, population growth and decline in international trade linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, determining whether national crop production can meet populations’ requirements and contribute to socio-economic resilience is crucial. Three crop models and three global climate models were used in conjunction with predicted population changes. Compared with wheat production in 2000–2010, total production and per capita wheat production were significantly (P < 0.05) increase in 2020–2030, 2030–2040 and 2040–2050, respectively, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 due to climate change in China. However, when considering population and climate changes, the predicted per capita production values were 125.3 ± 0.3, 127.1 ± 2.3 and 128.8 ± 2.7 kg during the 2020–2030, 2030–2040, 2040–2050 periods under RCP4.5, or 126.2 ± 0.7, 128.7 ± 2.5, and 131.0 ± 4.1 kg, respectively, under RCP8.5. These values do not significantly differ (P > 0.05) from the baseline level (127.9 ± 1.3 kg). The average per capita production in Loess Plateau and Gansu-Xinjiang subregions declined. In contrast, per capita production in the Huanghuai, Southwestern China, and Middle-Lower Yangtze Valleys subregions increased. The results suggest that climate change will increase total wheat production in China, but population change will partly offset the benefits to the grain market. In addition, domestic grain trade will be influenced by both climate and population changes. Wheat supply capacity will decline in the main supply areas. Further research is required to address effects of the changes on more crops and in more countries to obtain deeper understanding of the implications of climate change and population growth for global food production and assist formulation of robust policies to enhance food security. © 2023, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Do international trade diversification, intellectual capital, and renewable energy transition ensure effective natural resources management in BRICST region","Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, South Africa, and Turkey, collectively known as BRICST experienced rapid economic growth in recent years. A third of the world's material is mined to provide these nations' material needs. A lack of effective resource management results in the depletion of natural resources and the emergence of environmental consequences. Therefore, identifying the key drivers that stimulate effective resource management is crucial. This study draws an asymmetric association between trade diversification, intellectual capital, renewable energy transition, and material footprint in BRICST countries from 1990 to 2019. It applies Method of Moments Quantile Regression” (MMQR) to inspect the quantile-based association between variables due to possible non-normality in data. The outcome MMQR illustrates the negative and significant coefficients of trade diversification, intellectual capital, and renewable energy transition at all quantiles (0.1–0.9).

Does environmental governance matter to the relationship between digital transformation and high-quality development? Evidence from manufacturing sector in China,"Environmental governance has emerged as a crucial tactic to support the sustainable development of human civilization in light of the serious environmental issues. Meanwhile, during the process of promoting the high-quality development of China’s economy, digital transformation plays a significant role in improving the total factor productivity of the manufacturing sector. We seek to find out whether urban environmental governance has an impact on micro-enterprises, and therefore, the study selects the data of A-share listed manufacturing companies from 2012 to 2020 to study the effect of digital transformation on the total factor productivity of the manufacturing industry and how the effect of environmental governance affects the relationship between digital transformation and total factor productivity. The results unveil that digital transformation can significantly contribute to the total factor productivity of the manufacturing industry. At the same time, digital transformation can promote the high-quality development of enterprises by promoting the fulfillment of corporate social responsibility. Additionally, it is shown that poor environmental governance will weaken the promoting effect of digital transformation on total factor productivity. Furthermore, in state-owned companies and non-heavy polluting industries, environmental governance has a more significant moderating influence on digital transformation and total factor productivity. This study enriches the literature on urban environmental governance and micro-enterprise development, and they support the notion that, from the standpoints of environmental protection and economic development, the level of environmental governance should be continuously optimized and the development of ecological civilization should be strengthened. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"City Water Resources Vulnerability: The Case of Jinan and Qingdao in Shandong Province, China","In this paper, I want to describe the water resource vulnerability index of the two biggest cities in Shandong Province in China, Qingdao and Jinan, which represent the coastal and the inland areas of Shandong respectively. The period we study from 2008 to 2018. The Water Resources Vulnerability Index (WRVI) is according to the DPSIR (Drive, Pressure, State, Impact, and Response) framework, an index is established to qualify water resource vulnerability through water scarcity, water stress, water pollution, and water production efficiency. The result indicates that Climate change has a bigger impact on WRVI. Qingdao is more vulnerable than Jinan. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Customer focused science and knowledge management for sustainability in New South Wales, Australia","The New South Wales (Australia) State Government's direction is set through its 'NSW 2021: A plan to make NSW number one' ten year strategic plan. Key to the government's reforms is the objective to increase the devolution of decision making to the community by providing open access to data, information and services via transparent processes. For the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH), this is achieved through 'The Open OEH' program. The vision is to make OEH data and services open, available, accessible and useful to the community anywhere and anytime. This requires customer focused delivery that may depend on cross agency collaborations to set and deliver priority outcomes. Science within state government improves objective decision making at all levels and provides a lens through which often competing perspectives and demands from multiple customers may be better viewed and considered. The expectation is that science will 'bring to the table' and illuminate rigorous and transparent data and information on relevant issues and matters. OEH is seeking to better fulfil these expectations through its corporate emphasis on engaging customers. Understanding customer values is emerging as an important element in project management. A customer focus will progressively inform strategic priority setting for end to end project delivery of OEH science and knowledge management. State government science does not duplicate that of other recognised science providers. Science within Federal Agencies and Universities is more exploratory in nature whereas state government science is directed research, often drawing information from imperfect/incomplete knowledge. This knowledge is enhanced through participatory end user engagement, which allows for understanding of the data limitations and assumptions. Critical to this process is the concept of scientist social capital; that is, the benefits that arise from the science practitioner's connections, reputation, status and relationships. Paramount to success is developing and maintaining trust with an often diverse customer base. In the OEH the Science Division has undergone a major restructure to respond to the needs of NSW 2021. The new Ecosystem Management Science (EMS) branch consists of cross functional teams designed to deliver products and services to customers and colleagues undertaking policy and program design and delivery. The teams in the branch are headed by recognised scientific leaders who run programs using collective decision making. This seeks to optimise benefits from the science social capital of their connections, reputations and knowledge. It also enables them and their teams to work within a matrix management model to provide rapid and responsive science solutions while working towards long term strategic science program goals. There is a strong interdependency among all the EMS teams and this encourages interactions between individuals making possible a broad canvassing of ideas and knowledge. An important feature of the EMS branch is that its six teams are orientated on outcomes rather than science disciplines. This acts to further facilitate improved access to science and knowledge across teams and greater sharing of project components. To enhance knowledge creation and flow to customers, a dedicated science Knowledge Service Team has been created to instill rigor in knowledge management and thus directly contribute to Open OEH. This team will be strongly supported by an Evaluation Team that uses modeling and decision support systems. These systems will provide transparent, repeatable forecasting and scenario analysis capabilities. Clear two-way communication, will increase customer engagement, understanding, evidence-based decision making and action. Ultimately this will lead to better informed and more transparent discussions about ecosystem management including options for trade-offs and multiple co-benefits from government decisions and community investment. This will boost prosperity and sustainability by empowering community and government decision makers to improve ecosystem services and better sustain landscape and community productivity and function. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Technologies for adaptation of agriculture to climate change in Kyrgyzstan,"Climate change significantly impacts agricultural productivity, especially in arid regions such as Kyrgyzstan. The cultivation of drought-resistant crops and the introduction of innovative agricultural technologies are key measures to ensure the sustainability of the agricultural sector. The study aimed to assess the efficiency of growing drought-tolerant crops (sorghum, chickpea and millet) in Kyrgyzstan, as well as to analyse the impact of modern technologies, such as drip irrigation, on productivity and efficiency of water use. The study was conducted during two growing seasons (2023-2024) in an experimental field in Kyrgyzstan. Yields were determined by harvesting 1 m2 plots and then converting to hectare. Water use was measured using Delta-T Devices soil moisture meters (10, 20 and 30 cm depths). Water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated as the ratio of crop yield to water use. Crop conditions were monitored using DJI Agras T30 drones and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The results of the study confirmed the high performance of sorghum and pearl millet under drought conditions. Sorghum showed the highest yield of 4.2 tonnes/ha due to its well-developed root system and ability to use moisture efficiently. Millet showed the best WUE - 0.9 kg/m3 - and the lowest water use (4000 litres/ha), making it an optimal crop for water-stressed regions. Chickpea, despite its lower yield (1.8 t/ha), proved promising due to its nitrogen-fixing properties that improve soil fertility. The use of drip irrigation reduced water consumption by 20-30%, ensuring stable yields even under water deficit conditions. Monitoring using drones and moisture meters helped to optimise irrigation, improving the accuracy of water management. The study confirmed the efficacy of sorghum and pearl millet as key crops for arid regions, and the feasibility of integrating drip irrigation to improve agricultural sustainability. The results of the study provided science-based recommendations for farmers and policymakers on the introduction of drought-resistant crops and modern agricultural technologies in Kyrgyzstan, which will contribute to food security and sustainability of the agricultural sector under climate change conditions.

Pathways to strengthening capabilities: A case for the adoption of climate-smart agriculture in Pakistan,"Pakistan has an agro-based economy with a high dependency on the sector, contributing 19.2% to the country’s GDP. The country’s geographical position makes agriculture highly vulnerable to climate change as it frequently faces periods of extreme weather events-flooding, droughts, and heatwaves. Due to growing environmental issues and institutional incapacities, there is an observed trend of urbanisation and depleting natural resources. Changes in land use and water scarcity cause reduced productivity and compromised economic growth. The country needs to adopt Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) as an adaptation measure against climate change. CSA is an approach to adopting agricultural systems strategies to minimise climate impacts and preserve natural resources. This study explores the intervention that enhanced the capabilities of provincial agriculture service-delivery organisations in the adoption of CSA. It produced a country-specific CSA resource kit and delivered training for agriculture extension officers and frontline government officers in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. The Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC) and the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) jointly delivered the project in line with the broader mission of research support, building government capacities and suggesting science-based response strategies as adaptation measures. The project experience highly recommends the adoption of CSA in Pakistan. © The authors LICENCE This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.",Not About Sufficiency
Health Consequences of Environmental Exposures in Early Life: Coping with a Changing World in the Post-MDG Era,"Despite overall progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, large health discrepancies persist between developed and developing countries. The world is rapidly changing and the influences of societal change and climate change will disproportionately affect the world's most vulnerable populations, thus exacerbating current inequities. Current development strategies do not adequately address these disproportionate impacts of environmental exposures. The aim of this study was to propose a new framework to address the health consequences of environmental exposures beyond 2015. This framework is transdisciplinary and precautionary. It is based on identifying social and economic determinants of health, strengthening primary health systems, and improving the health of vulnerable populations. It incorporates deliberate plans for assessment and control of avoidable environmental exposures. It sets specific, measurable targets for health and environmental improvement. © 2016 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Sustainable and efficient utilization of weed biomass for carbon farming and productivity enhancement: A simple, rapid and ecofriendly approach in the context of climate change scenario","Climate change being very real and dangerous to our planet, immense efforts are underway to evolve mitigation measures to scale down the emission of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. Among the technological frameworks laid out to offset anthropogenic emission, carbon farming is considered to have co-benefits of restoring soil health and productivity enhancement. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to explore the carbon farming potential of weed biomass, which otherwise are considered as threats to agriculture, environment and biodiversity. The study was designed to transform the weed biomass to carbon rich humic substance using various activators such as urea, cow dung, microbial consortium (Bacillus subtilis), and a farm derived liquid organic formulation namely jeevamrutham. Results of the study indicated that among the activators, farm derived organic formulation was very effective in converting the weed biomass to carbon rich humic substance within a short period of 70–75 days. Apart from carbon, the humic substance produced from weed biomass was also endowed with essential nutrients, diverse microorganisms, increased resistance to pathogens, desirable quality for organic farming and consequent productivity enhancement. This approach for weed management, being environment and climate friendly, is popularized among women self-help groups, farmers, foresters etc. for enhanced livelihood as well as environmental safety. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
Biochar Mitigates Combined Effects of Soil Salinity and Saltwater Intrusion on Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by Regulating Ion Uptake,"Salinity intrusion is a significant threat to crop productivity and food security worldwide. The aims of the current study were to evaluate the effects of rice husk biochar amendment on the growth and yield of rice grown in saline soil with saltwater intrusion at the seedling stage and to investigate the mechanism by which biochar mitigates the harmful effects of salinity intrusion on rice. Phitsanulok 2 rice was grown in pots containing saline soil amended with 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% (w/w) rice husk biochar. Pots were put in a pond and 6 dS/m of NaCl was applied for 28 days. The results showed that biochar application significantly increased the survival, shoot height, shoot dry weight, yield, and yield components of rice. Biochar addition significantly decreased shoot Na+ contents and increased the shoot K+/Na+ ratio. By using a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer and a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, it was found that the negative surface charge of rice husk biochar was due to carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, and Na+ was detected on the surface of the biochar. We concluded that rice husk biochar amendment at a rate of 30% (w/w) could mitigate the negative effects of salt stress by absorbing Na+ in the saline soil, reducing Na+ uptake to the shoot, and increasing the shoot K+/Na+ ratio. Therefore, rice husk biochar amendment is a potential strategy for enhancing rice productivity in salt-affected soils with saltwater intrusion. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Development & Climate Days at COP 18 meeting report,"The Development & Climate Days celebrated its 10th anniversary at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change COP 18 in Doha, Qatar (1-2 December 2012). With a vision of re-energizing the original purpose of bringing together policy-makers, practitioners and researchers for intensely participatory learning, dialogue and networking, this event convened over 200 negotiators, policy-makers, scientists, funding agencies and development practitioners. A highly interactive, out-of-the-box programme featured 'speed networking' icebreaker sessions, experiential learning games about climate risk management and development, sharply moderated discussions, high-level panels and a 'Beyond the Film Festival'. Without support from the habitual Powerpoint presentation format, each of these sessions aimed to foster an environment of collaboration among participants, and inject serious fun into the climate and development dialogue processes. Key messages emerging from the event included: (i) considering ways to reduce social exclusion and generating 'constituencies of demand', in order to place the injustice of climate change in a political agenda guided by science, (ii) addressing the role of sub-national governments in delivering climate and development financing at community level, (iii) integrating climate services into climate-smart development, and (iv) improving understanding of Loss and Damage from the research, policy and practice perspectives. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Positive effect of marine biodiesel for water resource protection,"Situation of the serious water resource pollution in our country was introduced in this paper. Current water resource condition can't be able to keep sustainable development especially in water scarcity area just as Beijing and Tianjin. Beijing Jingzhong Sunlight Petrochemical Co. Ltd, located in Beijing, built marine biodiesel demonstration plant with abandoned waste oil as raw material to obtain biodegradable biodiesel which can replace petroleum diesel. The company also built oil plant supply base together with neighboring Inner Mongolia at Bayannaoer region. Biodiesel could play an important part in water resource protection if it was applied to water system for special environmental required river source, wetland and environmental protecting area. Using biodiesel to replace petroleum diesel in water system around Beijing has positive significance in the following three aspects: safeguard the capital for sustainable development, changing waste oil for good and greening subprime land. © 2011 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
"A critique of the interface between tourism, sustainable development and sustainable tourism in communitybased tourism theory","Given the fact that tourism is becoming the largest single sector of world trade, which has potential to substantially contribute to sustainable development from local to global scale. The need to develop tourism sustainably also becomes a primary concern. Human communities represent both a primary resource upon which tourism depends, and their existence in a particular place at a particular time may be used to justify the development of tourism itself. Tourism is supposed to be developmental in nature benefiting the local community by improving the Quality-of-Life and the standard of living for locals and local commerce. Community-based tourism has emerged as means to ensure that the host community benefit from the tourism industry. It is therefore imperative to understand that the community around tourism development is important and has to be involved in the development from the initial planning of the development as the sole beneficiaries of the development. Sustaining the community/particular communities has therefore become an essential element of sustainable tourism. The rationale of sustainable tourism development usually rests on the assurance of renewable economic, social and cultural benefits to the community and its environment. The concepts discussed in this paper show that they have principles that are similar to each other and are intended to deliver the same goals to benefit all stakeholders involved. If implemented well they should be able to preserve the environment, ensure that the sociocultural framework of the community is maintained, and also improves the living standards of the host communities. All these concepts have to fulfil the criteria that make it economically sensible as well as socially, culturally and ecologically compatible with the communities in which the development takes place. © 2019 AJHTL /Author/s.",Not About Sufficiency
A regional and international framework for evaluating seagrass management and conservation,"Seagrass meadows provide a range of key ecosystem services that are of high economic and societal value; seagrass meadows enhance biodiversity, provide food security through fisheries support, and are increasingly recognised for the role they play in mitigating climate change by the process of carbon sequestration. Whilst there is an increasing understanding of the global significance of seagrass habitats, the extent of these habitats is declining globally. The requirement to implement effective seagrass conservation and management strategies is thus becoming increasingly important. If the ambitions of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals are to be achieved, then nations need ambitious and applicable marine conservation plans. This includes management and protection to vulnerable ecosystems such as seagrass meadows. This study aims to evaluate a range of seagrass management and conservation approaches identified in different geographic regions, using a critique framework developed from the United Nations Environment Programme 2020 report on seagrass “Out Of The Blue: The Value Of Seagrasses To The Environment And To People’. Using the framework, seagrass management in Scotland is used as a case study and compared nationally to the rest of the UK (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) and internationally, to Europe (Wadden Sea), Australia (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park) and West Africa (Senegal). The results identify potential areas of development in Scotland to enhance its seagrass conservation effort, including increased research in seagrass science, widespread mapping of seagrass, long-term monitoring programmes, improved marine protected areas, inclusion of seagrass protective measures into environmental laws and policies and the implementation of appropriate habitat restoration schemes. The results also identify the need for open data if effective knowledge sharing is to take place, and to ensure that ocean science can fully support countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
The socioeconomic impact of a wildfire based on farmers’ perception: a case study for the island of Thassos,"Nowadays, wildfires have become a common natural disaster as a result of climate change, closely related to uncontrolled anthropogenic interventions, causing multiple socio-economic impacts on modern economies. In Greece, the remarkable extent of burned rural areas caused by wildfires has a significant economic impact in terms of farms and a national perspective. The present research aims to assess the impacts of wildfire on the agricultural sector on the basis of farmers’ perception with the tool of a questionnaire for the wildfire in Thassos island in north Greece recorded in 2016, and to unveil potential practices adopted for wildfire mitigation or prevention. On the basis of logit methodology, three models were estimated to identify and quantify the determinants of three dependent variables, namely, Burned cultivation replacement, Annual costs for fire mitigation, and Future actions-wait for re-sprouting for grafting. The findings of our analysis confirmed that the majority of farmers cannot assess the extent of the disaster, they are not willing to undertake further actions regarding the future of their burned cultivations, and they are not willing to undertake any further costs. Disappointment and resignation is confirmed and functions as an impediment to initiatives for present and future actions, especially for those who practice agriculture as a secondary source of income. The scientific value of the objective and subjective economic assessment stands on the provision of a useful tool in decision-making to conserve and improve rural life, food production and regional economic development. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Independent accident investigation: A modern safety tool,"Historically, safety has been subjected to a fragmented approach. In the past, every department has had its own responsibility towards safety, focusing either on working conditions, internal safety, external safety, rescue and emergency, public order or security. They each issued policy documents, which in their time were leading statements for elaboration and regulation. They also addressed safety issues with tools of various nature, often specifically developed within their domain. Due to a series of major accidents and disasters, the focus of attention is shifting from complying with quantitative risk standards towards intervention in primary operational processes, coping with systemic deficiencies and a more integrated assessment of safety in its societal context. In The Netherlands recognition of the importance of independent investigations has led to an expansion of this philosophy from the transport sector to other sectors. The philosophy now covers transport, industry, defense, natural disaster, environment and health and other major occurrences such as explosions, fires, and collapse of buildings or structures. In 2003 a multi-sector covering law will establish an independent safety board in The Netherlands. At a European level, mandatory investigation agencies are recognized as indispensable safety instruments for aviation, railways and the maritime sector, for which EU Directives are in place or being progressed [Transport accident and incident investigation in the European Union, European Transport Safety Council, ISBN 90-76024-10-3, Brussel, 2001]. Due to a series of major events, attention has been drawn to the consequences of disasters, highlighting the involvement of rescue and emergency services. They also have become subjected to investigative efforts, which in return, puts demands on investigation methodology. This paper comments on an evolutionary development in safety thinking and of safety boards, highlighting some consequences for strategic perspectives in a further development of independent accident investigation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Global citizenship is key to securing global health: The role of higher education,"Despite growing public awareness, health systems are struggling under the escalating burden of non-communicable diseases. While personal responsibility is crucial, alone it is insufficient. We argue that one must place themselves within the broader/global context to begin to truly understand the health implications of personal choices. Global citizenship competency has become an integral part of the higher education discourse; this discourse can and should be extended to include global health. A global citizen is someone who is (1) aware of global issues, (2) socially responsible, and (3) civically engaged. From this perspective, personal health is not solely an individual, self-serving act; rather, the consequences of our lifestyle choices and behaviors have far-reaching implications. This paper will argue that, through consciously identifying global health within the constructs of global citizenship, institutions of higher education can play an instrumental role in fostering civically engaged students capable of driving social change. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
The application of sustainability concepts to Australian agriculture: An overview,"This paper reviews the concepts of sustainable development in an economic, environmental and social context. Weak and strong versions of sustainable development are reviewed and applied to the agricultural sector. The paper demonstrates that despite any degradation of the natural resource base, the agricultural sector is more productive now than in the past. This has occurred because the rate of investment in research and development (resulting in increased reproducible capital) has more than offset the rate of degradation in the natural capital stock. Science, it is argued, is part of the economic system that allocates productive capacity between current and future generations. Increases in expenditure on agricultural R&D since the 1950s have ensured that past generations have transferred productive capacity to future generations. With respect to the environment, the authors argue that a strong version of sustainable development may be appropriate, particularly where there are uncertain and irreversible outcomes. Finally, it has been observed that a hybrid version of social sustainability has been adopted in Australia. While resource mobility in the agricultural sector has been generally encouraged (weak sustainability) this has been underpinned by a welfare system that ensures basic standards of well-being and opportunity (strong sustainability).",Not About Sufficiency
Greening healthcare at Muskoka Algonquin Healthcare,"Waste diversion is fundamental to reducing the ecological footprint.

"Climate Change Adaptation, Social Resilience, and Perceived Values Data from Turkana, Machakos and Narok Counties, Kenya","This dataset provides socioeconomic and value perception interview data collected from 1,021 individuals living across three counties in Kenya: Turkana, Machakos and Narok. The data are made available with sub-county level geospatial attribution. Socioeconomic data were collected on housing, healthcare, water sources, electricity access, experience of extreme weather events, community services, and access to information. Value perception data were collected using the user-perceived value (UPV) method – a perception-based surveying approach which requires interviewees to select their most valued household items in different circumstances, and explain their choice through ‘why’-probing. For this dataset, the UPV method was used to identify the most valued household items in daily life and in the event of an extreme weather event, e.g. a drought, floor or heatwave. Together, the socioeconomic and interview data can be used to better understand the views of different communities and demographic groups across Kenya concerning climate change and extreme weather events. They also provide insight about the intrinsic, social, emotional, epistemic, functional, and indigenous value associated with everyday household items. The data can be used by policymakers to inform development planning and to identify gaps in the available infrastructure. Additionally, researchers and development practitioners can use these data to design interventions which reflect the needs and values of communities in Kenya. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
"Geoscience for Earth stewardship, sustainability, and human well-being: A conceptual framework for integrating planet, prosperity, and people","There is a growing view that the mission of the Earth sciences ought to be more closely aligned with the global sustainability agenda, and specifically the grand challenges of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet the SDGs are criticized for lacking a coherent sense of the complex interconnections and synergies between its economic, environmental, and social ambitions, for maintaining the impetus of economic growth, and for the absence of a compelling narrative for what a sustainable future world might look like. Recognizing those limitations, this chapter offers an alternative meta-narrative to the global sustainability challenge in the form of coupled planetary and human well-being. It is a narrative that emerges from an overview of 5decades of environmental discourse and debate to emphasize the central importance of Earth stewardship as a unifying theme.

Climate change and costs: Investigating students' reasoning on nature and economic development,"The tensions between environmental protection and economic growth are critical to future well-being, and it is therefore important to understand how young people conceptualize these tensions. The aim of the present study is to explore students' solutions to the dilemma of economic development and mitigating climate change, with regard to societal responses to the challenge of climate change. The study was conducted in China's Green Schools. Green School is an international long-term programme with the aim of increasing students' knowledge of environmental issues, and transferring this knowledge into positive actions to affect the wider community. The data were obtained through semi-structured pre- and post-interviews with 15-16-year-old students in three groups (12 students) from Green Schools in the Beijing area. The results show that students' discussions focused exclusively on economic growth and social welfare. Students seem to believe that environmental problems are inevitable, nature is a 'box' of resources, and economic development is necessary in order to sustain and even improve nature. Therefore, there is no dilemma between economic development and environmental protection. The paper ends with a discussion on research and implications for teaching climate change. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Activities affecting land use in the European Arctic,"Globalisation and indirectly climate change have increased the pressures on developing new mining projects, transport routes and renewable energy in the European Arctic regions. At the same time, tourism and traditional livelihoods such as reindeer husbandry require large areas of pristine nature, which other activities may adversely affect. The planning of new activities must respect the needs, culture and livelihoods of local and indigenous communities, including land rights.

"The Political Ecology of Cause and Blame: Environmental Health Inequities in the Context of Colonialism, Globalization, and Climate Change","In this paper we explore how pervasive reasoning that ascribes blame to local cultures and practices for environmental health problems - ranging from food insecurity to harmful mold exposure - effectively obscures systemic and distal drivers of poor health, rendering marginalized groups as the authors and not the victims of population health inequities. Outside interventions that aim to improve environmental management, health, or both, consequently manage for a limited scope of perceived causes, and if they fail, sanction patients/peoples who are seen as resistant to the imposition of (externally defined) solutions. Drawing on examples from published accounts and primary fieldwork with upland communities in Nepal and Indigenous communities in Canada, we look at how these narratives ignore or obscure historical legacies of colonialism and external forces associated with globalization and climate change. We suggest these narratives are especially pressing in contexts of global environmental change, and especially pernicious in contexts of unprecedented globalization and economic integration. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The immediate impact of the first waves of the global COVID-19 pandemic on agricultural systems worldwide: Reflections on the COVID-19 special issue for agricultural systems,"CONTEXT: In May 2020, approximately four months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the journal's editorial team realized there was an opportunity to collect information from a diverse range of agricultural systems on how the pandemic was playing out and affecting the functioning of agricultural systems worldwide. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the special issue was to rapidly collect information, analysis and perspectives from as many regions as possible on the initial impacts of the pandemic on global agricultural systems, The overall goal for the special issue was to develop a useful repository for this information as well as to use the journal's international reach to share this information with the agricultural systems research community and journal readership. METHODS: The editorial team put out a call for a special issue to capture the initial effects of the pandemic on the agricultural sector. We also recruited teams from eight global regions to write papers summarizing the impacts of the first waves of the pandemic in their area. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The work of the regional teams and the broader research community resulted in eight regional summary papers, as well as thirty targeted research articles. In these papers, we find that COVID-19 and global pandemic mitigation measures have had significant and sometimes unexpected impacts on our agricultural systems via shocks to agricultural labour markets, trade and value chains. And, given the high degree of overlap between low income populations and subsistence agricultural production in many regions, we also document significant shocks to food security for these populations, and the high potential for long term losses in terms of human, natural, institutional and economic capital. While we also documented instances of agricultural system resilience capacities, they were not universally accessible. We see particular need to shore up vulnerable agricultural systems and populations most negatively affected by the pandemic and to mitigate pandemic-related losses to preserve other agricultural systems policy objectives, such as improving food security, or addressing climate change. SIGNIFICANCE: Despite rapid development of vaccines, the pandemic continues to roll on as of the time of writing (early 2022). Only time will tell how the dynamics described in this Special Issue will play out in the coming years. Evidence of agricultural system resilience capacities provides some hopeful perspectives, but also highlights the need to boost these capacities across a wider cross section of agricultural systems and encourage agri-food systems transformation to prepare for more challenges ahead. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
"Encouraging and enabling lifestyles and behaviours to simultaneously promote environmental sustainability, health and equity: Key policy messages from inherit","Human consumption and activity are damaging the global ecosystem and the resources on which we rely for health, well-being and survival. The COVID-19 crisis is yet another manifestation of the urgent need to transition to more sustainable societies, further exposing the weaknesses in health systems and the injustice in our societies. It also underlines that many of the factors leading to environmental degradation, ill health and social and health inequities are interlinked. The current situation provides an unprecedented opportunity to invest in initiatives that address these common factors and encourage people to live more healthily and sustainably. Such initiatives can generate the positive feedback loops needed to change the systems and structures that shape our lives. INHERIT (January 2016–December 2019), an ambitious, multisectoral and transnational research project that involved 18 organisations across Europe, funded by the European Commission, explored such solutions. It identified, defined and analysed promising inter-sectoral policies, practices and approaches to simultaneously promote environmental sustainability, protect and promote health and contribute to health equity (the INHERIT “triple-win”) and that can encourage and enable people to live, move and consume more healthfully and sustainably. It also explored the facilitators and barriers to working across sectors and in public private cooperation. The insights were brought together in guidelines setting out how policy makers can help instigate and support local “triple-win” initiatives that influence behaviours as an approach to contributing to the change that is so urgently needed to stem environmental degradation and the interlinked threats to health and wellbeing. This article sets out this guidance, providing timely insights on how to “build back better” in the post pandemic era. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency

Lake Erie's infamous cyanobacterial blooms have, however, threatened the health of this valuable freshwater resource for decades. Toxic blooms dominated by the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa have most recently been one of primary ecological concerns for the lake. These toxic blooms impact the availability of potable water, as well as public health and revenues from the tourism and fishery industries. The socioeconomic effects of these blooms have spurred research efforts to pinpoint factors that drive bloom events. Despite decades of research and mitigation efforts, these blooms have expanded both in size and duration in recent years. However, through continued joint efforts between the Canadian and United States governments, scientists, and environmental managers, identification of the factors that drive bloom events is within reach. This review provides a summary of historical and contemporary research efforts in the realm of Lake Erie's harmful cyanobacterial blooms, both in terms of experimental and management achievements and insufficiencies, as well as future directions on the horizon for the lake's research community. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Agroforestry and biochar to offset climate change: A review,"Expansion of agricultural land use has increased emission of greenhouse gases, exacerbating climatic changes. Most agricultural soils have lost a large portion of their antecedent soil organic carbon storage, becoming a source of atmospheric carbon-dioxide. In addition, agricultural soils can also be a major source of nitrous oxide and methane. Adoption of conservation agricultural practices may mitigate some of the adverse impacts of landuse intensification. However, optimal implementation of these practices is not feasible under all physical and biotic conditions. Of a wide range of conservation practices, the most promising options include agroforestry systems and soil application of biochar, which can efficiently sequester large amounts of carbon over the long-run. In addition, these practices also increase agronomic productivity and support a range of ecosystem services. Payments to farmers and land managers for sequestrating carbon and improving ecosystem services is an important strategy for promoting the adoption of such practices, aimed at mitigating climate change while decreasing environmental footprint of agriculture and sustaining food security. © 2012 INRA and Springer-Verlag, France.",Not About Sufficiency
Creating an enabling environment for WR&R implementation,"Reclaimed water is receiving growing attention worldwide as an effective solution for alleviating the growing water scarcity in many areas. Despite the various benefits associated with reclaimed water, water recycling and reuse (WR&R) practices are not widely applied around the world. This is mostly due to complex and inadequate local legal and institutional frameworks and socio-economic structures, which pose barriers to wider WR&R implementation. An integrated approach is therefore needed while planning the implementation of WR&R schemes, considering all the potential barriers, and aiming to develop favourable conditions for enhancing reclaimed water use. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology supporting the development of an enabling environment for WR&R implementation. The political, economic, social, technical, legal and institutional factors that may influence positively (drivers) or negatively (barriers) WR&R implementation in the regional water systems are identified, through the mapping of local stakeholder perceptions. The identified barriers are further analysed, following a Cross-Impact/System analysis, to recognize the most significant barriers inhibiting system transition, and to prioritize the enabling instruments and arrangements that are needed to boost WR&R implementation. The proposed methodology was applied in the Copiapó River Basin in Chile, which faces severe water scarcity. Through the analysis, it was observed that barriers outweigh drivers for the implementation of WR&R schemes in the Copiapó River Basin, while the key barriers which could be useful for policy formulation towards an enabling environment in the area concern the unclear legal framework regarding the ownership of treated wastewater, the lack of environmental policies focusing on pollution control, the limited integration of reclaimed water use in current land use and development policies, the limited public awareness on WR&R, and the limited availability of governmental funding sources for WR&R. © 2017 IWA Publishing Water Science & Technology.",Not About Sufficiency
Just Transitions’ Meanings: A Systematic Review,"As the world grapples with the issue of climate change, and efforts to decarbonize economies result in a shift from extractive “brown” industries to sustainable “green” ones, there is an increasing recognition of the need for this transition to be a just and equitable one. This systematic review of the Just Transitions literature examines the centrality of justice theory as well as the implications of the relative ambiguity with which governance models and theory have been conceptualized. Situating justice and governance theory in the Just Transitions concept, they are used to describe the “why” (justice) and the “how” (governance of transitions) of Just Transitions, and how these relate to the “what” (worker retraining, early retirement, regional development programmes, and so forth). The relatively poor articulation of the governance component within the Just Transitions concept is an opportunity for future academic examination. © 2023 The Author(s).

New York City delivers sustainable infrastructure,"New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) is currently improving their existing project delivery framework to focus on delivery of sustainable infrastructure. NYCDEP supplies and distributes more than 1 billion gallons of high-quality water to nine million New Yorkers and visitors every day, and treats 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater daily to achieve the smallest possible impact on water quality in New York Harbor. Beyond these core utility functions, we are also responsible for improving air quality, reducing noise pollution and protecting New Yorkers from hazardous substances. NYCDEP manages a large capital program, $2.3 Billion annually, aimed at the maintenance and expansion of the city's infrastructure. Predecessors who planned, designed and built NYC's water supply and sewer systems created engineering wonders that left future generations the infrastructure to support growth, prosperity and improved public health in NYC and its surrounding areas. These engineers did not know what the future would hold in terms of supply needs and water treatment, but they did have the wisdom and foresight to design in the flexibility for future generations of engineers to enhance and modify the system to meet the needs and challenges of their times. NYCDEP is applying this long term approach to address the vulnerabilities associated with climate change and the increasingly limited energy and material resources. The first step is incorporating sustainable design practices into the NYCDEP existing project delivery system (PDS). In conjunction with the PDS updates, NYCDEP selected the Envision sustainable infrastructure rating system for application on capital projects. The Envision rating system is a valuable communication platform that supports stakeholders in the evaluation and improvement of the triple bottom line (the balance of social, economic and environmental) criteria, as well as a sustainability reporting tool and third party certification. NYCDEP has adopted the application of Envision throughout the lifecycle (planning, design, construction and operations) for current and future infrastructure projects. © 2014 Water Environment Federation",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable development in the shadow of climate change,"Development plans at different levels - from local to global - aspire to eliminate poverty, famine, to make health care accessible, to create better access to education, to improve transportation, employment, and the quality of life, all within next decades. Yet, these plans collide with the reality of climate change, more precisely the Anthropocene, which already creates high-dimensional conflicts. These will only intensify within decades because climate change and other consequences of the environment global devastation lead to a real decrease of resources. These resources enable not only development but also an elementary reproduction of the essential preconditions of life. The current model of development has substantially contributed to the intensification of unequal accessibility to resources and existing conflicts have thus heightened and new ones have emerged. Water as an essential resource will cause new conflicts. Growing population, expansion of deserts and a sea level rise then increase conflicts for the land. Heat waves occur more often which strengthens conflicts for land suitable for human life, meaning that inhabitable areas are spreading. Therefore there is a need to re-evaluate the character and hierarchy of resources and their accessibility, and also concepts of development. The existing development of humankind has been done at the expense of others in many cases and mainly at the expense of the environment. The current situation raises a question of climate justice from both historical and systematic viewpoints. It opens a need to reformulate the concept of human rights from the perspective of their essential environmental preconditions and to define the status of environmental migrants. © 2019 Edipucrs.

Virtual diagnostic networks: A platform for collaborative diagnostics,"The successful management of plant diseases and insect infestations depend to some degree on accurate diagnoses delivered in a timeframe that enables effective response. Over the past few decades, many nations have experienced a steady increase in plant pathogen and pest incursions as well as the emergence of new pathogens that threaten plant health. The containment and mitigation of exotic plant pathogens and insect pests are dependent upon early detection and accurate diagnoses also in a timeframe to enable effective response. As we increase our dependence on international trade to address global economic and food security challenges, it is likely that incursions of pathogens and pests will continue, if not accelerate. Climate change, increasing standards of living, and globalized market systems will put increasing demands and pressures on the plant systems that provide us with food, feed, fiber, and medicines.

"Decreasing, not increasing, leaf area will raise crop yields under global atmospheric change","Without new innovations, present rates of increase in yields of food crops globally are inadequate to meet the projected rising food demand for 2050 and beyond. A prevailing response of crops to rising [CO2] is an increase in leaf area. This is especially marked in soybean, the world's fourth largest food crop in terms of seed production, and the most important vegetable protein source. Is this increase in leaf area beneficial, with respect to increasing yield, or is it detrimental? It is shown from theory and experiment using open-air whole-season elevation of atmospheric [CO2] that it is detrimental not only under future conditions of elevated [CO2] but also under today's [CO2]. A mechanistic biophysical and biochemical model of canopy carbon exchange and microclimate (MLCan) was parameterized for a modern US Midwest soybean cultivar. Model simulations showed that soybean crops grown under current and elevated (550 [ppm]) [CO2] overinvest in leaves, and this is predicted to decrease productivity and seed yield 8% and 10%, respectively. This prediction was tested in replicated field trials in which a proportion of emerging leaves was removed prior to expansion, so lowering investment in leaves. The experiment was conducted under open-air conditions for current and future elevated [CO2] within the Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment facility (SoyFACE) in central Illinois. This treatment resulted in a statistically significant 8% yield increase. This is the first direct proof that a modern crop cultivar produces more leaf than is optimal for yield under today's and future [CO2] and that reducing leaf area would give higher yields. Breeding or bioengineering for lower leaf area could, therefore, contribute very significantly to meeting future demand for staple food crops given that an 8% yield increase across the USA alone would amount to 6.5 million metric tons annually. © 2016 The Authors.

Analysing the Water-Energy-Food Nexus From a Polycentric Governance Perspective: Conceptual and Methodological Framework,"The Water-Energy-Food Nexus has emerged over the past decade as a useful concept to reduce trade-offs and increase synergies in promoting goals of water, energy and food securities. While WEF scholarship substantiates the biophysical interlinkages and calls for increased and effective coordination across sectors and levels, knowledge on conditions for effective coordination is still lacking. Analysing WEF nexus governance from a polycentricity perspective may contribute to better understanding coordination. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for analysing WEF nexus governance based on the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and the concept of Networks of Adjacent Action Situations (NAAS). The interdependence among transactions for pursuing WEF securities by actors in different action situations generates the need for coordination for changing or sustaining institutions, policy goals and policy instruments that guide actions leading to sustainable outcomes. Coordination is attained through arrangements based on cooperation, coercion or competition. Coordination in complex social-ecological systems is unlikely to be achieved by a single governance mode but rather by synergistic combinations of governance modes. Particular coordination arrangements that emerge in a context depend on the distribution of authority, information and resources within and across interlinked decision-making centres. Further, integrating the political ecology based conceptualisations of power into the analytical framework extends the governance analysis to include the influence of power relations on coordination. Methodological innovation in delineating action situations and identifying the unit of analysis as well as integrating different sources and types of data is required to operationalise the conceptual framework.

Impact of climate change and irrigation on the productivity of the lower Mekong basin,"The Mekong River is one of the important rivers in Southeast Asia. The river basin management is a subject of debate as its stakeholders have varying priorities such as hydropower, irrigation, water recreation, fisheries, and industrial and municipal water supplies. It is also subjected to natural and anthropogenic-induced changes. In this study, we evaluated the drought conditions using a hydrologic simulation in the Lower Mekong River basin (LMB), and moderate to severe drought frequently occurred last 30 years that led to detrimental economic losses. Based on the results of drought, we will investigate the demand and supply strategies for meeting food security in the LMB.

Spotlight: Eritrea.,"With a mid-1997 population of 3.6 million living in a land area of 39,000 sq. miles, Eritrea is Africa's most recent country, becoming independent from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year civil war. Eritrea's newly achieved statehood leaves Ethiopia landlocked and dependent upon Eritrea's ports for foreign trade. 95% of the population earns its livelihood through subsistence agriculture. While rain has been plentiful, Eritrea suffers from deforestation, soil erosion, and the remaining land mines from the civil war. Relative to men, women in Eritrea have lower status and power. The Eritrean National Statistics Office recently released findings from the nation's first demographic and health survey which indicate that child survival is improving. Under-5 child mortality fell from 185 deaths/1000 live births during 1981-85 to 136/1000 during 1991-95. Vaccination coverage has expanded in recent years, almost 40% of children under age 3 years are chronically malnourished, about 41% of recent mothers showed signs of chronic energy deficiency, and few Eritrean women receive adequate maternity care. The government recently launched a 3-year safe motherhood action plan designed to prevent maternal mortality by improving access to reproductive health services. Nationwide, the rate of total fertility in Eritrea is 6.1 births/woman, life expectancy is 48 years for men and 51 years for women, and total population size is growing annually through natural increase at the rate of 2.9%.",Not About Sufficiency
"Global Capitalism, Culture, and Ethics: Second Edition","This book seeks to deepen the reader’s understanding of the complex ethical and social disputes that corporations and managers face in an increasingly globalized world.

Listening to collaborate: Professional development for postsecondary agricultural education and training instructors teaching technical subjects in Nigeria,"Implementing high quality professional development for postsecondary Agricultural Education and Training (AET) instructors is a critical step in facilitating inclusive economic development in Nigeria. Most technical agricultural graduate programs in Nigeria do not include training in instructional methods, creating lesson plans, or assessment techniques and lecturers are usually forced into learning the craft of teaching through trial and error. Unfortunately, poor teaching and a lack of innovative strategies do little to break the status quo view that agriculture is a distasteful option for youths. It is likely that economic and social progress in Nigeria will be attenuated if AET systems cannot attract and motivate capable students to engage in addressing the critical problems surrounding food security, sustainability, and climate change. The purpose of this grounded theory study was to create a conceptual model for addressing the process oriented professional development needs of postsecondary AET instructors teaching technical subjects in Nigeria. © 2014, Assoc.

Human migration and infectious diseases,"Emerging infectious diseases (EID) are defined as diseases that have appeared recently or that have recently increased in their frequency, geographical distribution or both. Commercial globalisation, population movements and environmental changes are the main factors favouring the international spread of microorganisms. Transport and communication development constitutes also a remarkable factor in the worldwide dispersion of microorganisms. The mass movement of large numbers of people creates new opportunities for the spread and establishment of common or novel infectious diseases. A surveillance system to detect emergent and re-emergent infections, a rapid responsiveness of healthcare systems and laboratories, vector control, and the provision of healthcare education programmes to inform the population of how to avoid infections are needed in order to stop the spread of infectious diseases. © Journal compilation © 2009 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate and health education in public health schools worldwide during 2023–24: a survey,"Background: Public health professionals are crucial in implementing health-promoting climate change adaptation and mitigation measures, yet climate education is inconsistently integrated into public health curricula worldwide. We aimed to assess the proportion of institutions that provided public health degrees with climate and health education, the annual number of students trained in climate and health, and the extent to which students had climate and health knowledge during 2023–24. Methods: From Nov 1, 2023, to March 15, 2024, our online survey quantified climate and health education in public health schools that provide degrees across all WHO regions. The survey was available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese and distributed to Global Consortium on Climate and Health Education member institutions and organisations and the Global Network for Academic Public Health; institutions in 138 countries were invited to participate. We collected data on optional and mandatory training, enrolment in versus actual education on climate topics, degree programmes offering climate education, year of curriculum implementation, and the extent of training across eight competency domains. Instructions stated that the survey should be completed by school staff who designed, taught, or were familiar with climate or planetary health content and curricula within their institution. Two follow-up reminder emails were sent to institutions that had not completed the survey on Jan 13, 2024, and Feb 15, 2024. We also measured the presence of climate education among randomly selected non-responding institutions through internet searches for evidence of a class or a concentration from June 1 to July 25, 2024. Findings: The survey was sent to 1251 public health institutions across 138 countries; we received responses from 279 (22%) of 1251 institutions in 81 (59%) of 138 countries. Most institutions that we invited were in the WHO region of the Americas (n=776), the African region (n=177), and the European region (n=155). 196 (70%) of 279 responding institutions and 62 (77%) of 81 responding countries reported providing climate and health education during 2023–24. The number of responding institutions providing climate and health education was 53 (80%) of 66 in the European region, 21 (72%) of 29 in the Western Pacific region, five (71%) of seven in the South-East Asia region, 97 (68%) of 143 in the region of the Americas, 15 (63%) of 24 in the African region, and five (50%) of ten in the Eastern Mediterranean region. 298 degree-level public health programmes were identified during 2023–24, of which 171 (57%) reported that climate and health education was part of the required curriculum. Master's degree programmes provided the most climate and health education (118 [40%] of 298 degree-level programmes identified). A search of 135 additional non-responding institutions indicated that 36 (27%) likely offered climate and health education. Interpretation: Our global survey of institutions that provide public health degrees found widespread integration of climate topics in public health curricula. To address disparities, future work should prioritise integrating climate and health education globally, increasing investments, and securing institutional and political support. International cooperation and national engagement are essential to achieve comprehensive climate education across all public health training programmes. Funding: None. © 2024 The Author(s).

Testing the Effects of Water-Saving Technologies Adapted to Drought: Empirical Evidence from the Huang-Huai-Hai Region in China,"The aggravation of extreme weather events has dramatically increased the risk of severe water shortages and seriously threatened agricultural production. The Huang-Huai-Hai region, an important agricultural production region in China, is subject to a severe water shortage and is often hit by drought. As a result, water-saving technologies (WSTs) have been implemented. It remains unclear how effectively these WSTs can reduce crop yield loss, crop yield variation, and the loss of net crop income caused by water scarcity. Therefore, this paper aimed to analyze the role of WSTs in response to drought by establishing a multi-objective expected utility function based on 988 farmers across the Huang-Huai-Hai region. Econometric analysis employing an endogenous switching regression model showed that using WSTs can significantly reduce crop yield loss and net income loss caused by drought. Adopting household-based WSTs or community-based water-saving technology generates even greater positive effects on crop yield and farmers’ net income. Therefore, the government should promote farmers’ adoption of more advanced WSTs by increasing subsidies and strengthening policy support. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Factors enhancing and restricting the success of SRA compliance on the FLEGT/VPA initiative in Ghana. Insights from Juaso forest district in Ghana,"This study examines the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) between Ghana and the European Union (EU) within the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade Initiative (FLEGT). The VPA aims to enhance forest governance, reduce deforestation, combat illegal practices, and improve livelihoods of forest fringe communities. The research focuses on the implementation of social responsibility agreements (SRAs) under the VPA framework and identifies factors contributing to their success or presenting challenges. Data collection involved mixed methods, including literature review and a survey of individuals involved in SRAs. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses, including exploratory factor analysis, were conducted. Principal component analysis revealed that accountability, monitoring of implementation and progress of SRAs, and documentation of SRA agreements were key factors contributing to the success of negotiated SRAs, explaining about 68.36 % of success variance. Challenges and constraints were categorized into two main factors: weak community capacity to negotiate SRAs and weak community capacity to enforce compliance, explaining about 71.4 % of challenge variance. The study found that the exclusion of the local SRA committee (LSRAC) from certain decision-making processes affected trust and transparency in calculating SRA benefits. Elite capture of benefits was identified as an issue, as the LSRAC did not conduct sufficient consultations with community members before negotiations. The findings emphasize the importance of including local communities in all forest management activities and call for increased awareness of SRAs, particularly for the LSRAC. The study highlights the need for proper representation of community interests during negotiations and their inclusion in forest management plans. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Hospital Patient-Care and Outside-the-Hospital Energy Profiles for Hemodialysis Services: Report of Two Cases,"Studies investigated the patient-care (in-hospital) and outside-the-hospital energy consumptions for delivering the hemodialysis (HD) service. A life cycle inventory methodology was used for this patient-based analysis for two hospitals located in Wichita, Kansas. It was found that, for both hospitals, the actual HD machines consumed approximately 3.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electrical energy per HD, only 8% to 16% of the total energy used for delivering the HD service (in hospital). This increases to 9.6 to 28.9 kWh of hospital billable energy for the whole system of HD machine, auxiliaries, and dialysis water treatment. Converting these hospital direct electrical energy values to natural resource energy (nre) then adding the cradle-to-gate natural resource energy for the manufacturing and supply chain of all the HD consumables, the total is 78 to 149 kWh nre/HD. The nre measures all the direct fuel burned to generate energy and is thus directly related to emissions to the air, water, and land and is a direct secondary impact on public health from HD. The ratio of outside-the-hospital energy to direct hospital HD electrical energy consumption is 4:1 to 7:1, so a broader base exists for improvement than just the hospital. © 2014 by Yale University.",Not About Sufficiency

"Strikes, flooding, rats, and leptospirosis in Marseille, France","Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms by which weather conditions, the incidence of Leptospira in reservoir populations, and various socio-ecological factors are driving the emergence of leptospirosis in Marseille, France. Methods: Over the last 30 years our laboratory has surveyed all human cases of leptospirosis in Marseille using clinical, epidemiological, serological, and molecular tools. Data for the weather conditions in Marseille were collected from the official meteorological station, and garbage management strikes were monitored through the local press. Rats were trapped in alleys near to where the patients may have acquired leptospirosis. Results: Three new cases of autochthonous leptospirosis are reported. The global tendency for rainfall showed a slight increase over the period under analysis. The index case of leptospirosis occurred after a heavy rainfall with flooding. Over the last 10 years Marseille has undergone 82 days of garbage management strikes. Leptospira DNA was detected in two of 11 rats. Conclusions: The emergence of leptospirosis has become a public health problem in Marseille, and is associated with a combination of heavy rainfall and garbage collection strikes in which garbage is left on the street and thereby contributes to the expansion of the rat population on the surface. © 2011 International Society for Infectious Diseases.",Not About Sufficiency
STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS AND THEIR DERIVED SATISFACTION OF URBAN FORESTS IN THE MOST INDUSTRIALISED REGION OF POLAND,"In the face of growing urbanised areas, the presence of forests and their appropriate shaping is a key challenge for contemporary urban planning. The importance of forests is largely identified with natural, economic and social functions in non-urban areas; however, forests are of vital value in urbanised areas. This article explores young Polish urbanites' awareness of the role forests play, and submits diagnoses of the forests multidimensional benefits and their functions in Poland's urban areas. Moreover, the research is based on the premise that the management of urban forests must ultimately lead to the satisfying of social needs. Based on empirical research, the perceptions of the value of urban forests as assessed by young people (students) in the Slaskie Voivodeship are presented, leading to the authors' postulation that urban forests are underestimated resources. Furthermore, the study suggests that young Poles do not recognise the multi-beneficial aspects of urban forests; and the authors indicate feasible directions for local policy to achieve sustainable development. The final statements argue that in the face of serious threats to the functioning of Earth's ecosystem, a campaign for the presence of forests and green spaces in cities is necessary. © 2021 Wydawnictwo Ekonomia i Srodowisko.

Contribution of Using Filter Cake and Vinasse as a Source of Nutrients for Sustainable Agriculture—A Review,"The use of filter cake and vinasse in agriculture began in the 1970s and intensified in the 1990s. Currently, the Ukraine war and the high value of fertilizers have created opportunities for fertilization programs in agricultural systems with sustainable goals. This review presents updated data (1988–2024) and a discussion on the potential agricultural use of filter cake and vinasse and indicates the current progress of research on this subject in addition to future prospects. Filter cake stands out due to the formulation of organomineral fertilizers with direct application of composted or fresh forms, favoring the agronomic efficiency of phosphorus. The use of vinasse in fertigation is feasible and replaces potassium mineral fertilizers and other nutrients following an organic matrix. Future perspectives point to the agricultural use of filter cake and vinasse on a sustainable basis from different approaches. The aim is to potentiate their benefits in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. It is noteworthy that filter cake or vinasse, when combined with growth-promoting bacteria in irrigated crops, can nullify the negative effects of climate change due to increased productivity and, at the same time, meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. This contributes to facing global challenges related to food security by recycling nutrients for agriculture and generating clean bioenergy from sugarcane biomass. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Murkowski amendment kept out of EPA appropriation,"US Senate Democrats kept Lisa Murkowski's amendment to restrict EPA use of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to greenhouse gases for a year out of the agency's budget on 9/24/2009.

On 4/17/2009, EPA proposed an endangerment finding that GHG contribute to air pollution, which may threaten public health or welfare. However, according to federal lawmakers and groups pushing for legislation to limit CO2 and other GHG emissions, the proposed endangerment finding could set the stage for EPA to regulate greenhouse gases under the CAA. EPA apparently proposed moving the exemption limit to 25,000 ton/yr. Until Congress enacts cap-and-trade legislation, EPA is obligated to regulate GHG under the CAA. Jackson has notified the White House's Office of Management and Budget that EPA would exempt sources below 25,000 ton/yr and concentrate only on the 13,000 largest carbon emitters, which already are regulated under CAA for soot, SO2, and other pollutants.

Social housing as focus area for Nature-based Solutions to strengthen urban resilience and justice: Lessons from practice in the Netherlands,"Social housing typically encompasses neighbourhoods with low social-economic status. Here, environmental problems like climate change and biodiversity loss have a higher impact than in other neighbourhoods. Applying Nature-based Solutions (NbS) may enhance the resilience of social housing neighbourhoods and as such make cities more just. In this article we explore to what extent NbS can be applied, given the physical, social and financial limitations that define Dutch social housing practice, and - by doing so – what NbS can contribute to environmental justice. Based upon several Living Lab experiences and dialogues with numerous housing corporations, ten NbS measures have been identified that likely will match with current practices in social housing. Implementing NbS contributes to all aspects of environmental justice, with distributional justice as the most straightforward one (more NbS means more environmental benefits). Procedural and recognitional justice were found to be of crucial importance to make greenspaces worthwhile for the residents. Our study draws attention to the fact that NbS knowledge is key but currently still insufficient, both within housing corporations as within the key partners (local authorities, landscaping firms). This means that there is a growing demand to increase NbS knowledge in the social housing sector.

Vitamin PP was applied exogenously through three different methods: seed soaking, foliar application, and soil irrigation. The application of 1 mM Pb(NO3)2 resulted in decreased root (from 13.9% to 19.9%) and shoot length (from 16.2% to 24.8%) and increased catalase (CAT) activity from 45% to 106%, and peroxidase (POX) activity from 39% to 46% compared to the control. Lead stress led to an increase in proline (Pro) content from 30 to 63% and comparatively in malondialdehyde (MDA) content (rising from 61% to 79.4%), as well as elevated assimilatory pigment content (by 35%) in barley grown in the pot experiment. Exogenous vitamin PP significantly and positively influenced the improvement of the measured morphological, biochemical, and physiological parameters, reducing the toxicity of lead salts. It was shown that the most effective method of vitamin PP application was achieved through foliar spraying and irrigation. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
How do we best synergize climate mitigation actions to co-benefit biodiversity?,"A multitude of actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems can have co-benefits for both climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Reducing greenhouse emissions to limit warming to less than 1.5 or 2°C above preindustrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement, can yield strong co-benefits for land, freshwater and marine biodiversity and reduce amplifying climate feedbacks from ecosystem changes. Not all climate mitigation strategies are equally effective at producing biodiversity co-benefits, some in fact are counterproductive. Moreover, social implications are often overlooked within the climate-biodiversity nexus. Protecting biodiverse and carbon-rich natural environments, ecological restoration of potentially biodiverse and carbon-rich habitats, the deliberate creation of novel habitats, taking into consideration a locally adapted and meaningful (i.e. full consequences considered) mix of these measures, can result in the most robust win-win solutions. These can be further enhanced by avoidance of narrow goals, taking long-term views and minimizing further losses of intact ecosystems. In this review paper, we first discuss various climate mitigation actions that evidence demonstrates can negatively impact biodiversity, resulting in unseen and unintended negative consequences. We then examine climate mitigation actions that co-deliver biodiversity and societal benefits. We give examples of these win-win solutions, categorized as ‘protect, restore, manage and create’, in different regions of the world that could be expanded, upscaled and used for further innovation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity as key drivers of ecosystem services provided by soils,"Soils play a pivotal role in major global biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nutrient, and water), while hosting the largest diversity of organisms on land. Because of this, soils deliver fundamental ecosystem services, and management to change a soil process in support of one ecosystem service can either provide co-benefits to other services or result in trade-offs. In this critical review, we report the state-of-the-art understanding concerning the biogeochemical cycles and biodiversity in soil, and relate these to the provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services which they underpin. We then outline key knowledge gaps and research challenges, before providing recommendations for management activities to support the continued delivery of ecosystem services from soils. We conclude that, although soils are complex, there are still knowledge gaps, and fundamental research is still needed to better understand the relationships between different facets of soils and the array of ecosystem services they underpin, enough is known to implement best practices now. There is a tendency among soil scientists to dwell on the complexity and knowledge gaps rather than to focus on what we do know and how this knowledge can be put to use to improve the delivery of ecosystem services. A significant challenge is to find effective ways to share knowledge with soil managers and policy makers so that best management can be implemented. A key element of this knowledge exchange must be to raise awareness of the ecosystems services underpinned by soils and thus the natural capital they provide. We know enough to start moving in the right direction while we conduct research to fill in our knowledge gaps. The lasting legacy of the International Year of Soils in 2015 should be for soil scientists to work together with policy makers and land managers to put soils at the centre of environmental policy making and land management decisions. © Author(s) 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
Soils as carbon sinks: The global context,"Soil carbon sequestration could meet at most about one-third of the current yearly increase in atmospheric CO2-carbon, but the duration of the effect would be limited, with significant impacts lasting only 20-50 years. Coupled with this limited duration, increases in population and per-capita energy demand mean that soil carbon sequestration could play only a minor role in closing the difference between predicted and target carbon emissions by 2100. However, if atmospheric CO2 concentrations are to be stabilized at reasonable levels (450-650 ppm), drastic reductions in carbon emissions will be required over the next 20-30 years. Given this, carbon sequestration should form a central role in any portfolio of measures to reduce atmospheric CO 2 concentrations over this crucial period, while new energy technologies are developed and implemented. International agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, encourage soil carbon sequestration and could be used to formulate soil carbon sequestration polices. Such policies need to take account of other environmental impacts as well as political, economic and societal needs, so that they form part of a raft of measures encouraging sustainable development. Of the carbon sequestration options available, those of a 'win-win' nature, that is, those that increase carbon stocks at the same time as improving other aspects of the environment, and those that protect or enhance existing stocks ('no regrets' implementation) show the greatest promise in meeting these goals.",Not About Sufficiency
A study on factors influencing the visitor experience on eco tourism activities at parambikulam tiger reserve,"Eco tourism is one of the fastest-growing segments of tourism industry. Its potential for growth is virtually unlimited. Any tourism program which is: nature - based, ecologically sustainable, where education and interpretation is a major concept and where local people are benefited can be called ecotourism. The Western Ghats of Kerala, with its tropical forest ecosystem, provides a natural advantage for development of Ecotourism and can be projected as an Ecotourism Zone in the true sense. It is commonly perceived that ecotourism in protected areas can bring incentives necessary for their management and has minimal physical and social impact on the visited area. They also demonstrate the commitment of the present generation to the future generation. Protected areas are the cornerstone of most national biodiversity conservation strategies. The research study revealed the features, facilities and experience of tourists on ecotourism activities at Parambikulam Tiger Reserve. The study identifies the factors that influences the visitors to undertake tourism activities at Parambikulam Tiger Reserve, and suggested measures to increase the satisfaction level of visitors by improving the facilities at the Tiger Reserve for a sustainable tourism development in the region. © 2020 Publishing India Group.

Technology Prioritization for Climate-Resilient Nutritive Fish,"Fish play an important role in human nutrition by providing protein and essential amino acids. They also add vitamins and minerals to the staple food for a nutritious diet. However, the changing climate is one of the most expected threats in providing a continuous supply of micronutrients, but there are opportunities also which accelerate nutritive sensitive fisheries management. The researchers highlighted the potential physical and biological impacts of changing climate on fish nutrition effect on the nutritional quality of the fish. The physical and biological impacts of climate change may affect the nutrition of fish by affecting their nutritional quality. The physical changes include a rise in water surface temperature, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, high salinity, flood, and change in the harvesting sector; however, the biological changes are responsible for changes in the primary production, distribution pattern, and fish pathology. Elevated water temperature may affect physiological processes of the fish, which finally affect the reproduction process of fish and survival of the larvae. Increases in flood frequency show negative impacts on fish feeding and breeding grounds by the destruction of the freshwater ecosystem or may create a positive impact to expand the aquatic habitats for primary production. The intrusion of more saline water into the coastal zone is expected due to rise in sea level which may affect the distribution of fish. The high wind may also impact fish catching and trade activities. These climatic factors limit the availability of fish in the human diet and interfere with food security directly. Therefore, to improve the food security of the globe through the fisheries sector it is mandatory to follow adaptation and mitigation pathways to safeguard this sector. The chapter deals with the technology prioritization in fish nutrition and feeds technology to provide climate-resilient nutritive fish for human food security. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
"Do Rehabilitated Canals Influence Irrigation Technology Choices? Evidence from Smallholders in Madhya Pradesh, India","Investments to rehabilitate and modernize irrigation systems as well as price subsidies to incentivize adoption of drip and sprinkler irrigation technologies are promoted to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability of on-farm water use across India. We examine the effect of these two policies on farmer irrigation choices in surface irrigated farms in Madhya Pradesh. A logistic regression based on novel survey data from 918 farmers estimates a 3% reduction in the probability that farmers will adopt drip or sprinkler technologies if they are located on farms serviced by irrigation schemes where 30% or more of the irrigated area was rehabilitated. Results also reveal that, on average, farmers are 12% more likely to continue using irrigation technologies if they had adopted them prior to the start of rehabilitation works. Quantitative results are complemented with semi-structured interviews of farmers to better understand drivers of adoption, which suggest that: (1) open, gravity canals do not always restrict drip or sprinkler adoption, (2) water scarcity appears to be a strong driver for farmers to adopt, despite financial constraints, (3) socio-economic factors such as caste, education, and house ownership does not seem to influence a farmers' choice of adoption, and (4) social networks provide a stronger incentive for adoption as smallholders struggle to access government subsidies. Understanding the role of social networks in influencing the irrigation practices of farmers can complement supply-side infrastructure investments and financial incentive policies to enhance the water security of smallholders facing climatic risks to food production. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Not About Sufficiency

A review of India’s water policy and implementation toward a sustainable future,"India is one of the most significant economies globally, and the sustainable use of this priceless resource depends considerably on its water supplies. Moreover, a rural and monsoon-dependent nation faces water scarcity challenges, fueling potential conflicts among sectors and regions while intensifying challenges to food security and livelihoods. This paper conducts a chronological review of India’s evolving water supply policies, assessing their impact, identifying gaps in policy implementation, and striving to provide insights for the country’s future development of equal and sustainable access to water. In this context, integrating artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in smart water management systems, presents promising implications for improving water supply efficiency and optimizing service delivery pro-cesses, proving indispensable in addressing water-related challenges, particularly in regions like India. It could detect and mitigate water losses within distribution systems, providing practical water purification, distribution, and conservation solutions. This review paper also dis-covered that the Practical Integrated Water Resource Management approach emphasizes decentralized management of water resources and advocates for more efficient, context-specific, and locally tailored solutions for assessing the water resource system for implementing water policy. This approach further leads to minimizing the water scarcity problem in a particular area or region. © 2025 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Reframing food systems resilience: towards a global Sustainable Development Agenda SDG 2 (Zero Hunger),"The food system includes all of the operations that go into growing, distributing, and preparing food as well as the labor force and other components needed to get a specific food item from the farm to the table. A food system’s resilience is defined as its capacity to adjust and maintain the long-term provision of sufficient, suitable, and acceptable food for all individuals, even in the face of unforeseen disruptions. In a nutshell, it’s about making sure food is always available despite continual disturbances. Disruptions can be man-made or natural, and they can manifest as stresses, which are slow degradations, or shocks, which are abrupt disturbances to the food chain. For instance, long-term droughts that function as stressors or extreme weather events that operate as shocks might result from climate change, progressively changing the environment and the food chain.

Organic farming is indispensable in addressing key future challenges,"The necessity for sustainable food security for the global population, as well as the need to protect the environment, mainly natural and man-made ecosystems, and landscapes, has boosted the prerequisites for organic practices that function in harmony with nature. Organic farming is an exclusive amalgamation of environment-friendly agriculture practices, which require low external inputs, thereby contributing to increased quality food availability and sustainability. This goal is accomplished by employing methods that increase crop productivity without impairing the environment or the people who live and work with it. Food produced from organic farming is nutrition rich and devoid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides. Different regions face context-specific challenges, for instance, biodiversity loss, climate change, governance, and health-related issues in converging toward biologically mediated ecosystems. For addressing all the future threats and challenges, there is an urgency for an integrated approach to biological and inorganic chemical science in agriculture which is the only viable option. In the present context, consumers are now aware of the inclusion of planetary food in their regular food recipes which prompted the farmers to act accordingly. The prime objective of this chapter is to revisit and propose the integrated organic and indigenous technical practices of agriculture to ensure food and nutritional security, climate change mitigation, restore biodiversity, and maintain the food supply chain in certain unprecedented situations, for example, COVID-19 pandemic orchestrating all efforts toward the address of Sustainable Development Goals. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Spatiotemporal Variability and Trends in the Rainfall and Temperature of a Sub-Tropical Region of Eastern India and Their Implications,"The increase of water demand in various sectors has led to a growing freshwater shortage in many parts of the world, including India. Growing mismanagement of available water resources and changing climatic conditions are accelerating the disparity between water supply and water demand. Consequently, ensuring water security and food security is one of the greatest sustainability challenges of the twenty-first century. To address this challenge, this study focuses on the spatio-temporal variability and long-term trend analysis of two major climatic variables, viz., rainfall and temperature time series obtained from 14 weather stations situated in a sub-tropical region of Eastern India. For the trend analysis, three well-known statistical tests were used. It was found that both the spatial and temporal variations in annual rainfall and monthly temperatures (Tmax, Tmin and Tmean) are statistically significant at 1% level of significance. The analysis of trends in the annual rainfall time series revealed significant increasing trends of 18.98 and 20.61 mm per year at Burdwan-I and Mejhiastations, respectively, and “no trend” at the remaining weather stations. However, significant decreasing trends ranging from − 0.022 to − 0.064 °C per year were found in the maximum temperature (Tmax) time series of July, September, October, and November. In contrast, significant increasing trends varying from 0.023 to 0.03 °C per year were identified in the minimum temperature (Tmin) time series of May at most stations. The results of this study have direct implications for climate change impacts in the region. The findings of this study can help formulate climate-resilient and adaptive strategies for the effective planning and management of water resources to sustain agricultural productivity, the environment and livelihoods in the region. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Practices in Regional Science and Sustainable Regional Development: Experiences from the Global South,"This book brings together the emerging trends and techniques incorporated in regional science during the first two decades of this millennium. The book includes systematic and analytical notes making scientific commentary on the innovative methods of regional development, measurement of the development, regional development models, and policy measures that have significant implications and wide applicability instrumental for India as well as the other global south countries. There is clear evidence in the global south of the uneven spatial distribution of resources, economic activities, literacy, and health conditions. The most striking fact is the coexistence of development and underdevelopment that makes the planning process complicated. This can hardly be explored without taking a deep insight into the matter of how the regional parameters are impacting regional society or economy to shape the development of that region. There can be no effective global policy framework that will be effective equally for each and every region to mitigate local issues of society or economy. It is here that the book integrates the efforts of practitioners working towards addressing these regional issues and striving for sustainable regional development through their innovative ideas. Through its contributions, the book addresses development issues, regional impact of climate change, social justice, migration, well-being, livelihood vulnerabilities, and regional urban-environmental issues from the standpoint of regional science. It is a significant resource for researchers of spatial science, and policy makers. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change adaptation in Indian cities: A review of existing actions and spaces for triple wins,"Cities are at the forefront of climate action as never before: they concentrate risk but also provide opportunities to innovate. Situated at the crossroads of extensive urbanization, unequal development, and high climate vulnerability, Indian cities face an urgent imperative to adapt to current and projected climate change impacts. While a global assessment of urban adaptation notes, “of 43 Indian cities…we found no examples of municipal government adaptation being reported” (Araos et al., 2016: 380), Indian cities are increasingly reporting various planned and autonomous actions that have adaptation co-benefits. We review city plans and peer reviewed and gray literature to examine adaptation action in 53 Indian cities with a population of >1 million. We find: (1) approximately half of these cities report adaptation actions, 67% of which are in the implementation phase; (2) adaptation is typically implemented through sectoral projects focusing on particular risks; (3) some interventions have synergies with sustainable development and mitigation, representing opportunities for co-benefits; and (4) there remain gaps in using city-scale risk assessments to inform adaptation action. Four illustrative examples (Ahmedabad, Surat, Coimbatore, and Mumbai) highlight how different approaches (mainstreaming vs. strategic adaptation; reactive vs. planned adaptation) have different implications on risk management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
India's Evergreen Revolution,"Global food security is one of the most pressing challenges the world is facing today. In an era dominated by fast-paced technological and digital progress in the agricultural landscape, famines still break loose and continue unabated in certain parts of the world. The recent hunger crisis that erupted in the Horn of Africa only further reaffirms this claim. The problem of hunger and malnourishment extends beyond the frontiers of Africa. Despite its economic achievements, India hosts the world's largest number of undernourished and malnourished people. Using India as a case study, this article attempts to situate hunger and food insecurity in a multidimensional context, which is not only triggered by natural factors (e.g. climate change and natural disasters) but also stems from structural inequality existing in the domestic and global order. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the Agenda 2030 stress achieving zero hunger and enumerate further sub-goals to serve as blueprints for its execution. Against this background of hunger and food security, India is analysed for its capacity and performance in achieving the target of zero hunger. Additionally, this paper seeks to assess the extent to which sustainable goals are sufficient in the battle towards eliminating hunger by taking into account India's position in the global order.",Not About Sufficiency
Current status of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infection in animals & humans in India: What needs to be done?,"Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) has emerged as a major health problem for domestic livestock and human beings. Reduced per animal productivity of domestic livestock seriously impacts the economics of dairy farming globally. High to very high bioload of MAP in domestic livestock and also in the human population has been reported from north India. Presence of live MAP bacilli in commercial supplies of raw and pasteurized milk and milk products indicates its public health significance. MAP is not inactivated during pasteurization, therefore, entering into human food chain daily. Recovery of MAP from patients with inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn’s disease and animal healthcare workers suffering with chronic gastrointestinal problems indicate a close association of MAP with a number of chronic and other diseases affecting human health. Higher bioload of MAP in the animals increases the risk of exposure to the human population with MAP.

Integrated watershed management for increasing productivity and water-use efficiency in semi-arid tropical India,"Poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition are pervasive in the semi-arid tropics (SAT) of South Asia, including India. In rural areas, most of the poor make their livelihoods on the use of natural resources, which are degraded and inefficiently used. This is because of the inadequate traditional management practices of managing agriculture as well as the fact that resulting crop yields are much below the expected potential yields. ICRISAT in the early 1970s initiated research on watersheds for integrated use of land, water, and crop management technologies for increasing crop production through efficient use of natural resources, especially rainfall that is highly variable in the SAT and is the main cause of year-to-year variation in crop production in India. Improved watershed management on Vertisols more than doubled crop productivity, and rainfall-use efficiency increased from 35% to 70% when compared with traditional technology. After many years of implementing and evaluating these improved technologies in on-farm situations, many lessons were learned and they formed part of the integrated watershed management model currently being pursued by ICRISAT in community watersheds in rural settings. This watershed model is more holistic and puts rural communities and their collective actions at center stage for implementing improved watershed technologies with technical backstopping and convergence by consortium partners. We describe here the achievements made in enhancing crop productivity and rainfall-use efficiency by implementing improved technologies in on-farm community watersheds in India. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

"Transmigration and Palm Oil: Exploring Developmental Synergies in Sumatra, Indonesia","The Indonesian government’s 20th century transmigration program promoted the resettlement of more than 5 million impoverished farmers from Java, Bali, and Madura to the outer islands of Sumatra, Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and West Papua. By doing so, it also unleashed forces stimulating agricultural production and natural resource-based development that reshaped the nation’s economy and transformed vast stretches of pristine rainforest into corporate and smallholder oil palm plantations. The growing presence of entrepreneurial farmers eager to diversify from food crop to cash crop production, provincial government policy promoting oil palm smallholdings, and the central government’s introduction of Nucleus Estate Schemes in transmigration settlements all contributed to the dynamic growth of the oil palm sector since 1980 and Indonesia’s rise to become the world’s top palm oil producer. This paper will apply a case study of Jambi province in central Sumatra to explore historic and exogenous factors linked to transmigration that have shaped the local growth of the oil palm industry. It will also examine some of the economic and social impacts of palm oil production on four specific transmigrant communities and compare outcomes for transmigrant and local communities by applying a novel Local Sustainability Index and national village census data. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Akihisa Mori and Alin Halimatussadiah; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
Reducing reservoir impacts and improving outcomes for dam-forced resettlement: Experiences in central Vietnam,"The present study focuses on the growing problem of the impacts of human displacement resulting from hydropower dam construction, within the context of the integrated lake basin management of dam reservoirs. Dam-forced displacement and resettlement can pose severe challenges to the environmental, economic and social sustainability of a reservoir basin. A case study in Quang Nam Province, central Vietnam, suggests that many resettled communities experience impoverishment due to the lack of adequate replacement land, declines in supplemental food sources and reduced access to natural resources. In response to such situations, resettled residents may (i) destroy lake catchment forests for the purpose of converting them to farmland or engage in illegal logging; (ii) increase agrichemical inputs on reduced land, thereby polluting run-off and groundwater; and (iii) place increased pressure on fish stocks and wildlife. Examples are provided from central Vietnam to illustrate the need for applying management approaches that allows the affected people to become beneficiaries of dam projects and for including civil society organisations in resettlement planning. The hydropower authority can fund benefit-sharing mechanisms, including village-level electrification and payment for environmental services schemes, in which resettled populations are paid for forest maintenance and protection to prevent erosion and deforestation, and reservoir access can be provided for fishing, aquaculture and agriculture. Civil society organizations can advocate for residents' interests and for reallocation of protected forest land for community forestry. These approaches can be supported by an inclusive reservoir management board working to achieve environmental sustainability, economic growth and social equity. © 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Parameterized models for estimating atmospheric longwave radiation and surface net radiation in the Brazilian semi-arid region,"This study seeks to understand and estimate atmospheric longwave irradiance (Rld) and surface net radiation (Rn) using parameterized models applied to semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. Studies on surface energy flows are of interest to areas such as environmental and agricultural sciences, and are of great importance in analyzing and managing water resources. Thus, this research could benefit the study region, which constantly experiences periods of water scarcity that affect agricultural activities and the lives of communities. An exploration of data gathered from micrometeorological stations spanning the period from 2014 to 2016 within various caatinga vegetation areas exhibiting distinct levels of preservation. This exploration involved comparative analyses between methods available in existing literature and those proposed by the authors. The biome under study is unique to Brazil and remains relatively underexplored in terms of comprehensive research and studies. In the Rld analysis, parameterizations for days with clear and cloudy skies were considered, and the proposed models presented results that surpassed the results of most of the tested models in the literature. Among the models examined, the Crawford and Duchon (1999) model displayed remarkable efficiency in estimating Rld within the study area. Furthermore, the models were fine-tuned to estimate the surface Rn for the respective areas of each micrometeorological station. These calibrations factored in both dry and rainy seasons for the Rn analyses. The calibration results were satisfactory, with r2 values for the proposed models greater than 0.90 for Rld for clear sky conditions and 0.94 for all conditions, and a high agreement was shown with values greater than 0.96 according to the criteria of Willmott et al. (2012). The results for Rn show the potential of the models to contribute, for example, to measuring water loss from a vegetated surface, an essential task in agricultural planning. Among the tested models, the one developed by Crawford and Duchon (1999) proved to be very efficient in estimating the Rld in the study area. The models were adjusted to estimate the surface Rn for the areas of each of the micrometeorological stations, taking into account the dry and rainy seasons in the Rn analyses, where the calibrations could present satisfactory results with r2 always close to 1 and high concordance. Implementing models such as those analyzed and proposed tends to contribute to sustainable development and management of the environment and agricultural systems. However, it is important to consider the difficulties encountered in searching for data to calibrate the models, which are scarce in the region, indicating the need for policies that stimulate investment in research and monitoring of environmental variables in the region. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Local Climate Change Adaptation under the Lenses of Public Health: A Case Study from Porto, Portugal","Introduction: Climate change is a pressing public health issue. Urban populations, especially in coastal areas, are highly vulnerable. As climate change progresses, local adaptation becomes increasingly important. We present a case study about the inclusion of public health concerns in local climate change adaptation in Porto (Portugal). Methods: We analysed two local adaptation plans using qualitative content analysis and conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposeful sample of 6 key stakeholders with different profiles. We did a qualitative content analysis of the respective transcripts. Results: Porto is undergoing healthrelevant consequences of climate change, which are expected to worsen further in the future. Porto's geographical and demographic characteristics and urban environment make its population highly vulnerable to climate changerelated health risks. Public health is recognized as a central element in local adaptation efforts. Drivers for integrating health concerns include growing climate change awareness, a sense of urgency, social capital, institutional networks, access to resources, and political commitment. Nevertheless, challenges like data limitations, resource constraints, climate knowledge gaps, communication issues, and political cycles hinder both local adaptation and the integration of health considerations. Discussion/Conclusion: In Porto, health seems both a powerful mobilizing issue and a central topic concerning local adaptation. However, the complex and long-term nature of climate change and the associated uncertainty hinder adaptation efforts. High-quality data about both the local climate and population health are thus essential. The transversal nature of risk is recognized and multi-sectorial approaches, public participation, mainstreaming, and policy integration are necessary to prevent imbalances. Local adaptation efforts, including healthrelated efforts, are shaped by the international (belonging to the European Union), national, and local contexts. Successful local adaptation and inclusion of health aspects require mainstreaming and policy integration across different areas and involvement of multiple stakeholders, including the population, in order to maximize resources and avoid undesired trade-offs. © 2024 The Author(s).

Enhancing the bioconversion rate and end products of black soldier fly (BSF) treatment – A comprehensive review,"Food security remains a pressing concern in the face of an increasing world population and environmental challenges. As climate change, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity continue to impact agricultural productivity, traditional livestock farming faces limitations in meeting the growing global demand for meat and dairy products. In this context, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) have emerged as a promising alternative for sustainable food production. BSFL possess several advantages over conventional livestock, including their rapid growth, adaptability to various organic waste substrates, and low environmental impact. Their bioconversion rate, the ability to transform organic waste into valuable products, and final product optimization are key factors that enhance their potential as a nutrient-rich protein source, fertilizer, and biofuel. This review explores strategies to enhance the bioconversion rate and improve the end products derived from BSF treatment. It highlights the benefits of using BSFL over other interventions and underscores the significance of optimizing their bioconversion rate to meet the challenges of global food security sustainably. Despite the promising prospects of BSF-derived products, consumer acceptance and regulatory hurdles remain critical aspects to address in realizing their full market potential. The utilization of BSFL as a sustainable source of food and feed can contribute to waste management, reduce environmental pollution, and address the pressing issue of food security in an environmentally responsible manner. However, there is a need for further research and innovation to ensure the safety, quality, and economic viability of BSF-based products for both animal and human consumption. © 2024, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Determining the role of land resource, cropping and management practices in soil organic carbon status of rice-based cropping systems","Rice-based cropping systems (RBCS) cover the majority of cultivated land in Bangladesh and are the country's primary source of food security. To bolster food security, cropping intensity has increased by 192% in the last 30 years. Concerns have been raised about the sustainability of such cropping increases, particularly for soil productivity and resilience, with many areas reporting low soil organic carbon (SOC). The research assessed the levels of SOC, total nitrogen (TN) and soil pH in RBCS to identify relative importance of the land resource, cropping and management settings on these soil properties and to determine options for sustainable land use intensification. Soil samples (0–30 cm) were collected following stratified random design from a range of RBCS and analyzed for SOC, TN and soil pH. These soil properties were interpreted against previously developed farming system typology of Soil Carbon Improvement Likelihood (SCIL) and the legacy soil datasets. SOC was recorded higher in the stop-go triple cropping (12.00–16.33 g/kg) compared to the triple and double cropping intensities (6.90–8.30 g/kg). The crop-diversified and mustard-rice cropping systems of High SCIL, where there is crop rotational diversity and high residue retention, recorded a higher SOC. However these systems were also located on inherently fertile soil (Floodplain medium highland) compared to the less diverse cropping systems (wheat-rice, veg.-rice and rice-rice) of Medium and Low SCIL. The wheat-rice system had the lowest SOC (5.46 g/kg), which is considered to be a consequence of low crop residue retention and reduced periods of inundation in highland on the Piedmont plain or Terrace. However, the build up of SOC and TN was linked to soil acidification associated with altered fertilizer regime and crop residue removal. Cropping intensity, and in particular, the associated cropping systems and management, were determinants of SOC, depending on which land resource setting and cropping systems were practiced by the smallholders. The types of cropping systems and management options in land resource settings were identified that have the potential for sustainable land use intensification. The implications would be to ensure these cropping systems are conserved, and trade offs contemplated to meet the rising food demand and carbon sequestration goals to counteract smallholder vulnerability to climate change in Bangladesh and South Asian countries. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Policy considerations for african food systems: Towards the united nations 2021 food systems summit,"Achieving food and nutrition security and ending hunger is a complex and multi-faceted global challenge, which requires urgent attention, particularly in Africa. To eliminate hunger, the continent needs to transition to new sustainable, inclusive, and resilient food systems that deliver nutritious food and a healthy planet for all. This paper discusses challenges and opportunities highlighted during the “Food Systems Transformation to Address the SDGs” session convened by the African Research Universities Alliance (ARUA) and partners at the 8th World Sustainability Forum (WSF2020) held in September 2020. The paper reflects on how African food systems need to change to achieve the food systems related and interconnected the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also presents issues for consideration at the 2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit. Key considerations include (i) the realization that nutrition insecurity is not food insecurity, (ii) the need for Africa to actualize its potential, (iii) the need to demystify policy development processes; (iv) the need to invest in better measurements and indicators; and (v) the need to create nature-based climate-smart solutions. © 2021 by the authors.

Nexus between fossil fuel consumption and infant mortality rate: a non-linear analysis,"For nations already facing pollution issues, fossil fuel energy consumption is deteriorating living standards. Though prevailing infrastructure makes fossil fuel energy use feasible for production, it still pollutes our environment. This study in the domain of environment and development assesses the impact of fossil fuel energy consumption on the infant mortality rate in 15 Asian economies during 1996 and 2019. The living standards are assessed using infant mortality rate, while non-linear fossil fuel energy consumption is used with gross capital formation, employment, and preprimary education as independent variables. The feasible generalized least square method evaluates the effects. The study concludes that fossil fuel energy consumption follows a U-shaped relationship explaining infant mortality. The results point out that over-consumption of fossil fuel energy is deteriorating the living standards considering low air quality levels in Asian economies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Measurement report: Sources and meteorology influencing highly time-resolved PM2.5 trace elements at three urban sites in the extremely polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain in India,"High-time-resolution aerosol measurements across various Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) regions are critical due to these regions' dense populations, intense industrial activities, recurring pollution episodes, and agricultural practices, as well as the associated health impacts and broader climate implications of aerosol. However, studies (mostly offline) have been predominantly concentrated in the upper IGP (U-IGP), with limited spatial coverage across the central IGP (C-IGP). This study aims to bridge the gap by examining both U-IGP and C-IGP regions, offering an in-depth analysis of elemental concentrations, source apportionment, inter-regional comparisons, seasonal variations, meteorological influences, and health risks through high-resolution Xact measurements conducted at three urban locations. During the colder seasons, elements such as sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K) were found to dominate elemental PM2.5 concentrations, while the warm seasons showed notable changes in aluminum (Al), silica (Si), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba) concentrations. These variations underscore the influence of meteorological conditions and different emission sources on pollution levels. From a health perspective, average levels of carcinogenic elements (lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr)) were usually kept below reference levels. However, Pb concentrations exceeded these thresholds by 40 %-50 % during both periods in the U-IGP, largely attributed to coal combustion and lead smelting activities. Using the Multilinear Engine 2 (ME-2) solver, positive matrix factorization (PMF) deconvolved Cl-rich, coal combustion, Cu-rich, dust, solid fuel combustion 1 (SFC1), SFC2, and S-rich components. In both IGP regions, Cl-rich sources, S-rich sources, and SFC1 dominated the elemental sources, with differences observed in their relative contributions, indicating the influence of regional emissions. The role of meteorology in elemental PM2.5 variations during both clean and polluted episodes in the IGP regions was observed. During pollution episodes, the relative contribution of Cl-rich sources increased when PM2.5 concentrations showed a sharp increase as compared to clean periods, especially during cold periods, indicating the role of emissions from trash burning (plastic and PVC) and steel industries along with favorable meteorological conditions in the formation and accumulation of pollutants. During the warm period, the relative contribution of Cl-rich sources in the C-IGP is less, but during the cold period, both the U-IGP and the C-IGP have significant Cl-rich source contributions (44 %), indicating the role of chlorine in extreme haze air pollution in the whole IGP region. During warm periods, high-pollution events occurred across the IGP with major contributions from SFC1 (crop residue burning), indicating that severe pollution events also depend on seasonal emission sources despite less favorable meteorological conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of elemental pollution across the IGP, offering a robust foundation for devising targeted mitigation strategies and regulatory policies to safeguard public health in this densely populated region.

Examining the Role of Intergenerational Relations in Food Systems: Evidence from Western India,"Food systems and their normative goal of achieving food security remain a robust global agenda. However, with the shifts toward a sustainable food system, there is an increasing interest in consolidating evidence on multiple dimensions of the food system. This article is an empirically grounded argument for using intergenerational relations to expand understanding of food systems by looking beyond the usual security outcomes and emphasising social welfare outcomes. Drawing on ethnographic research in an indigenous village in western India, I examine a rural, local food system and the transformations therein because of various socio-economic drivers, including changing livelihood opportunities. Evidence shows growing generational solidarity, with some positive effects for environmental sustainability and for revaluing indigenous culture, including traditional food systems, and generating new local livelihoods. Simultaneously, though, tensions are being created around intergenerational autonomy and cultural expressions. Moreover, the food transition has resulted in a decline in the nutritional content of local diets, which has health implications. This article raises questions whether trends towards sustainability and resilience are necessarily mutually reinforcing for natural resource-dependent indigenous communities and our natural environment. © 2024 SAGE Publications.",Not About Sufficiency

Different Facets of Lignocellulosic Biomass Including Pectin and Its Perspectives,"The plant matter, lignocellulosic biomass, is a renewable and inexpensive abundant natural resource in the world. The development of inexhaustible energy rehabilitated from agricultural waste is an alternative for fossil fuel to reduce CO2 emission and prevent global warming. The amount of waste generated has a direct correlation with the human population. Thus, the waste generated by the community is being added to the environment as the municipal, agricultural waste, and waste produced from forest-based industries. Moreover, there are high possibilities of having environment-friendly valuable bio-based products, including biofuels, biogas, enzymes, and biochar from biomass without competing with the food supply chain. However, only a few or limited kinds of products are produced industrially. This review highlights the significance of lignocellulosic biomass. It describes the different valuable products like biochemicals, biochar, enzymes, single-cell protein, dye dispersant, and bioplastic from lignocellulosic biomass, emphasizing their applications briefly. Besides, this review also highlights the pretreatment of biomass, mainly focusing on biological pretreatment. Natural biomass utilization would lead to solving the energy shortage, food security issues, and obstacles for developing technological solutions in agriculture, agro-processing, and other related manufacturing sectors.

Experimental investigation of a heat pump-assisted solar humidification–dehumidification desalination system with a free-flow solar humidifier,"Global water scarcity is one of the biggest human concerns in recent decades. Seawater desalination becomes the dominant way to access the new drinkable waters. The present study developed a heat pump-assisted humidification–dehumidification water desalination system. The designed system is equipped with a novel solar humidifier that works based on the free-flow solar water collectors. The effect of air flow rate and mode of the air circulation system on the performance of the designed system was experimentally investigated. The results reveal that raising the air flow rate improved water evaporation rate and the solar humidifier efficiency, while closing the air circuit led to a reduction in the evaporation rate. The maximum evaporation amount and water productivity were around 1.38 and 1 kg/h/m2 in the average solar irradiance of 877 W/m2. The closed-loop air circulation system resulted in a significantly higher effectiveness of dehumidification and produced higher desalinated water compared with the open-circuit mode. The lowest specific electrical energy consumption and the highest gained output ratio values of, respectively, 0.15 kWh/kg and 2.36 were observed at the air flow rate of 0.019 m3/s/m2 of solar humidifier when closing the air circulation system. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).",Not About Sufficiency
An integrated modeling approach to assess the impact of climate change on maize,"Global food security could be under threat due to the impact of climate change on regional grain production. With the threat of climate change looming large on crop productivity, the most vulnerable regions of the world are the tropics. Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important cereals of the tropics. Available evidence showed a significant drop in yields of important cereal crops like rice, wheat and maize under climate change scenarios. Hence, it is necessary for us to empathize the changing climate over a period of time to feed the growing population. In this paper the impact of climate change on maize was studied through climate and crop model integration. To reduce impacts, altering the sowing dates was also attempted as an adaptation. Results revealed an increase in maximum and minimum temperature over decades in both the models. Unvaryingly in both the models the rate of increase of minimum temperature was higher than that of maximum temperature. Between the models PRECIS projected higher rate of increase than RegCM4. In case of rainfall, both the models projected an increase with variation in their magnitude. RegCM4 projected a higher increase in rainfall than PRECIS. Under DSSAT crop simulations, both models exhibited a reduction in yield while PRECIS showed higher yield than RegCM4. In future under CO2 enriched conditions, the sowing on 20th September showed better results under PRECIS climate while 10th August proved beneficial for RegCM4 climate projections. © 2017, Association of Agrometeorologists.

Scaling up innovations in smallholder agriculture: Lessons from the Canadian international food security research fund,"Scaling up food security innovations in low-income rural environments has often failed to achieve substantive and lasting results. This poor performance can be attributed to dominant, linear approaches associated with spreading innovations which entail technology research and development and subsequent transfer to farmers. Such approaches tend to overlook complexity elements and non-linear processes in smallholder agriculture, including multiple stress factors such as climate variability and economic risks that make the uptake of new agricultural innovations more unpredictable. This article presents programmatic lessons from the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund (CIFSRF)on scaling up. It considers projects that: i)deployed successfully pilot-tested innovations to reach and benefit large numbers of beneficiaries; and projects that ii)used innovations as an entry point to catalyse systematic change in the food and agricultural sector. The paper also outlines several key scaling up principles that can encourage better understanding of relevant socio-ecological dynamics and complexities in intervention areas as a way to support innovations (at scale)that can contribute to more sustainable system outcomes. Finally, the paper reflects on how predominant definitions of impact at scale, centered around rather narrow indicators around economic growth and technology transfer, might consider more holistic goals that encompass integrated agricultural interventions that advance sustainable agri-food system outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Land Use Changes and Sustainable Development Goals Alignment Through Assessing Ecosystem Service Supply and Demand Balance,"Ecosystem service quality is closely linked to human well-being, and sustainable provision of ecosystem service is essential for ensuring regional ecological security and achieving sustainability goals. An innovative valuation framework is introduced that combines land use/cover change (LUCC) analysis, supply and demand matrices and Gini coefficient calculations to assess the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ES-S and ES-D). Unlike traditional static methods, this approach captures intricate spatial and temporal mismatches, offering new insights into the impacts of LUCC on ES balance within the framework of sustainable development goals (SDGs). Taking the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) as a case study, the findings indicate a significant decrease in cultivated land, accompanied by expansion of forest and built-up area, driven by farmland-to-forest policies and urbanization. These shifts have improved the balance of provisioning and supporting services but have also intensified regional disparities, particularly in Chongqing, where demand outpaces supply. Furthermore, LUCC have altered the capacity of ecosystems in the TGRA to provide essential services, such as soil retention and water regulation, thereby supporting progress toward SDGs related to ecosystem sustainability. However, imbalances in cultural services persist, highlighting the need for targeted management strategies to optimize ES provision and support regional sustainability. This study underscores the importance of ongoing ES-S and ES-D assessments to inform sustainable land management policies in ecologically sensitive areas like the TGRA. © 2025 The Author(s).

Assessment of Urban Ecological Resilience and Its Influencing Factors: A Case Study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration of China,"Climate change and rapid urbanization bring natural and anthropogenetic disturbance to the urban ecosystem, damaging the sustainability and resilience of cities. Evaluation of urban ecological resilience and an investigation of its impact mechanisms are of great importance to sustainable urban management. Therefore, taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration (BTHUA) region in China as a study area, this study builds an evaluation index to assess urban ecological resilience and its spatial patterns with the resilience surrogate of net primary production during 2000–2020. The evaluation index is constructed from two dimensions, including the sensitivity and adaptability of urban ecosystems, to capture the two key mechanisms of resilience, namely resistance and recovery. Resilience-influencing factors including biophysical and socio-economic variables are analyzed with the multiple linear regression model. The results show that during 2000–2020, the spatial pattern of urban ecological resilience in the BTHUA is characterized by high resilience in the northwest and relatively low resilience in the southeast. High resilience areas account for 40% of the whole region, mainly contributed by Zhangjiakou and Chengde city in Hebei Province, which is consistent with the function orientation of the BTH region in its coordinated development. Along with urbanization in this region, ecological resilience decreases with increased population and increases with GDP growth; this indicates that, although population expansion uses resources, causes pollution and reduces vegetation coverage, with economic growth and technological progress, the negative ecological impact could be mitigated, and the coordinated development of social economy and ecological environment could eventually be reached. Our findings are consistent with mainstream theories examining the ecological impact of socio-economic development such as the Environmental Kuznets Curve, Porter Hypothesis, and Ecological Modernization theories, and provide significant references for future urbanization, carbon neutrality, resilience building, and urban ecological management in China. © 2022 by the authors.

Exogenous application of thiourea for improving the productivity and nutritional quality of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum l.),"Because it is a staple food, sustainable production of wheat is crucial for global food security. Arid and semi-arid regions are worst affected by climate change, which has resulted in poor productivity of different crops, including wheat. To this end, this study aimed to investigate the effect of foliage-applied thiourea on the growth, yield, and nutritional-quality-related traits of bread wheat. The treatments consisted of thiourea levels (control, 500, and 1000 mg L−1 ) factorally combined with two diverse wheat cultivars (Gandam-1 and Galaxy-2013) at different growth stages (tillering, booting, and heading) and was repeated over two years. The analysis of the data shows that thiourea treatments and the cultivars significantly (p ≤ 0.05) affected the growth, nutritional quality traits, and morphological traits, and the interaction of the two factors was also significant. Improvement in productivity and nutritional quality was observed from the application of thiourea in both cultivars. Galaxy-2013 performed best at 1000 mg L−1 thiourea application for both productivity-and nutritional-quality-related traits at the heading stage. In conclusion, exogenous application of thiourea improves the productivity and nutritional quality of wheat on sandy loam soils in semi-arid regions; however, for wider recommendations, more trials may be conducted across various agro-ecological regions. © 2021 by the authors.

Prediction of drought-flood prone zones in inland mountainous regions under climate change with assessment and enhancement strategies for disaster resilience in high-standard farmland,"Predicting drought and flood disaster-prone alternating zones and enhancing cropland disaster resilience are critical for agricultural water management, mitigating meteorological disaster risks, and ensuring food security. However, the spatial prediction of climate disaster vulnerability at the local scale faces challenges such as data gaps and insufficient resolution, which results in a lack of relevant research. This study uses a coupled model of particle swarm optimization (PSO), long short-term memory (LSTM), and graph attention network (GAT) integrating historical data to predict drought- and flood-prone areas in 2035 in Heshun County, Shanxi Province, a typical small-scale inland mountainous region of China. Additionally, the study assesses cropland resilience using the TOPSIS method, and based on the spatial distribution of drought and flood disasters, proposes a Flood-Drought-Resilience Analysis (FDRA) framework, further formulating a site selection strategy for future High Standard Farmland (HSF) projects. The overall findings indicate that: (1) Precipitation (Pr) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) have increased in recent years, with Pr expected to continue rising until 2035. (2) The integration of historical data with the predictions from the PSO-LSTM-GAT model reveals significant spatial overlap between historical and future disaster-prone areas and intensive cropland, especially in the central region. (3) Compared to single models, the PSO-LSTM-GAT model demonstrates significantly improved performance and precision in predicting drought- and flood-prone areas. (4) Through the FDRA integrated adjustment mechanism, 6.6668 km² of unsuitable land was identified, and 6.7349 km² of high-quality land was selected as the proposed site for the next round of HSF projects. In the final part of the study, management zoning plans were designed for other areas vulnerable to drought and flood disasters, and specific recommendations for enhancing cropland resilience were provided. This study provides a theoretical basis for enhancing agricultural disaster resilience and sustainable development in localized areas, offering scientific decision-making support for policymakers to address future climate change and disaster risks. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Public Health Messaging for Wildfire Smoke: Cast a Wide Net,"Wildfire smoke events are increasing in British Columbia (BC), Canada and environmental and public health agencies are responsible for communicating the health-related risks and mitigation strategies. To evaluate and identify opportunities for improving public communications about wildfire smoke and associated health risks we collaborated with end-users and developed a 32-question online survey. The survey was deployed province-wide from 29 September to 31 December 2020 following a severe wildfire smoke episode, which impacted large parts of BC. Using a convenience sample, we disseminated the survey through email lists, radio advertisements, a provincial research platform, and snowball methods. There were 757 respondents, who were generally representative of provincial demographics. Respondents indicated that they receive wildfire smoke messages from diverse sources, including: websites, social media, radio, and television. Radio was identified as the most important source of information for populations that may have increased exposure or health risks, including Indigenous respondents and those working in the trades. Respondents with lower educational attainment expressed that messaging should be simplified. Environmental and public health agencies should continue to share wildfire smoke messages using diverse methods, ideally tailoring the messages and methods to specific populations at risk for exposure and health effects.

Global Requirement to Disaster Nursing,"Globalization affects various disasters and health risks. People benefit from globalization, but they are being exposed to its adverse effects and suffer from health problems. “Health” is a key dimension to be addressed within an all-hazard approach to disaster risk reduction (DRR). SDG3 highlights concerns about people health and well-being common to DRR, climate change, and sustainable development, and this is also reflected in respective global agenda. The importance of local issues is also highlighted in the global agenda, and therefore local healthcare networking becomes quite critical. In an ever-changing global risk landscape, “living with uncertainties” is the key word. To cope with the uncertainties, adaptive governance becomes a key pillar, where new ways of governance mechanism need to be performed. To enhance better disaster nursing and healthcare dimensions in disaster risk reduction, we need to emphasize on several issues like: (1) trans-, multi-cross disciplinary collaboration; (2) development of knowledge society; (3) open science and open governance, (4) grassroot and process innovation with citizen science; (5) youth leadership; and (6) science-based entrepreneurship. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
AMEE Consensus Statement: Planetary health and education for sustainable healthcare,"The purpose of this Consensus Statement is to provide a global, collaborative, representative and inclusive vision for educating an interprofessional healthcare workforce that can deliver sustainable healthcare and promote planetary health. It is intended to inform national and global accreditation standards, planning and action at the institutional level as well as highlight the role of individuals in transforming health professions education. Many countries have agreed to ‘rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes’ to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% within 10 years and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, including in healthcare. Currently, however, health professions graduates are not prepared for their roles in achieving these changes. Thus, to reduce emissions and meet the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), health professions education must equip undergraduates, and those already qualified, with the knowledge, skills, values, competence and confidence they need to sustainably promote the health, human rights and well-being of current and future generations, while protecting the health of the planet. The current imperative for action on environmental issues such as climate change requires health professionals to mobilize politically as they have before, becoming strong advocates for major environmental, social and economic change. A truly ethical relationship with people and the planet that we inhabit so precariously, and to guarantee a future for the generations which follow, demands nothing less of all health professionals. This Consensus Statement outlines the changes required in health professions education, approaches to achieve these changes and a timeline for action linked to the internationally agreed SDGs. It represents the collective vision of health professionals, educators and students from various health professions, geographic locations and cultures. ‘Consensus’ implies broad agreement amongst all individuals engaged in discussion on a specific issue, which in this instance, is agreement by all signatories of this Statement developed under the auspices of the Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE). To ensure a shared understanding and to accurately convey information, we outline key terms in a glossary which accompanies this Consensus Statement (Supplementary Appendix 1). We acknowledge, however, that terms evolve and that different terms resonate variably depending on factors such as setting and audience. We define education for sustainable healthcare as the process of equipping current and future health professionals with the knowledge, values, confidence and capacity to provide environmentally sustainable services through health professions education. We define a health professional as a person who has gained a professional qualification for work in the health system, whether in healthcare delivery, public health or a management or supporting role and education as ‘the system comprising structures, curricula, faculty and activities contributing to a learning process’.

Community-Based Tourism: Addressing Social Needs in Tropical Regions,"This chapter seeks to explore how community-based tourism (CBT) focuses on meeting social needs of local community in tropical regions. Tropical economies rely heavily on tourism, but managing it requires making trade-offs between ecosystem services and socio-cultural identities. The aim of this study is to reflect on the role of CBT in promoting local community welfare and sustainable tourism. It draws upon a qualitative research approach based on the review of variety of sources, including empirical studies, official data, research reports, and case studies. It highlights how CBT empowers the local community and provides unique memorable experiences to tourists. This research contributes through the proposed framework abbreviated as ‘ADAPTATION’ to promote CBT while mitigating negative effects. Implementation of proposed framework will have profound implications in boosting tropical regions. This chapter analyses only tropical regions’ destinations, so one should be cautious when generalizing the framework for implementation in other regions. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Sook Rei Tan, Haejin Jang and Jacob Wood; individual chapters, the contributors.

Strigolactones: Coordination with other phytohormones and enhancement of abiotic stress responses,"Abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, extreme temperatures, light intensity fluctuations, and nutrient deficiencies are significant challenges in agriculture. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, threatening crop yields and food security. To address these challenges, efforts should focus on developing resilient crop varieties and promoting sustainable farming practices. Strigolactones (SLs) were originally identified for their role in promoting germination in root parasitic plants. They have since been recognized as significant contributors to various aspects of plant biology. SLs function as versatile signaling molecules, orchestrating a myriad of plant physiological processes, including abiotic stress tolerance. They enhance plant resilience to abiotic stresses, improve growth, optimize photosynthesis, enhance water use efficiency, and reduce oxidative stress damage. SLs engage in interactions with diverse phytohormones to finely regulate essential processes in plants, aiding their survival and productivity in challenging environments. SLs hold the promise of enhancing our ability to protect plants from abiotic stress impacts. They can ensure sustainable food production amid climate change. This review delves into SL metabolism, explores the molecular mechanisms driving SLs perception and signal transduction, and the multifaceted roles that SLs play in plant physiology. Special emphasis is placed on their interactions with diverse phytohormones and their substantial role in bolstering resilience against abiotic stress. Moreover, the review covers crucial research gaps and future prospects concerning SLs application. Overall, our review enhances understanding of SLs application and advances efforts towards global food security and environmental sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Characteristics and Performance of Agricultural Households Diversifying to High Value Crops: Evidence from Rural India,"A plethora of empirical studies from Africa, Asia and Southeast Asia have shown that diversification to high value crops (HVC) is a win-win strategy in terms of its significant positive effects, inter alia, on income, employment, food and nutritional security and gender equality. Crop diversification also helps in environmental protection and adaptation to climate change; checks degradation of natural resources including soils and contributes towards attaining eight out of the seventeen sustainable development goals. It is, therefore, important to understand salient characteristics and performance of agricultural households diversifying to such crops to devise suitable strategies to promote crop diversification. This study, using data from situation assessment surveys of 2012-13 and 2018-19, brings out distinguishing characteristics of households diversifying to HVCs and compares their performance in terms of net returns, household income, and consumption expenditure, extent of income inequality and incidence of poverty with non-diversifiers. © 2023 Indian Society of Agricultural Economics.

"Diminishing Habitats, Vanishing Species: Primates of the Threatened Tropical Lowland Rainforest Fragments in the Upper Brahmaputra Valley, Northeastern India","The tropical lowland rainforests of the Upper Brahmaputra Valley in the northeastern Indian state of Assam have, in the past, and are increasingly being converted to other land-use forms, driven by historical and current anthropogenic factors. Development and the heavy dependence of people on these forests for their daily needs has resulted in the severe loss of the once-contiguous forests into isolated fragments, with a hostile, human-dominated, matrix hindering the movement of most nonhuman species between them. These forest fragments, however, continue to be rich in various flora and fauna, including seven primate species. This entry examines the different drivers of habitat fragmentation and their consequences for the nonhuman primates of the Upper Brahmaputra Valley. We first analyze the historical drivers of forest cover change in the landscape during the pre-colonial, colonial and the post-colonial periods, locating these changes within the political economy and demographic milieu of each regime. We next examine the recent drivers of forest cover change, and discuss, more precisely, the impacts of local and landscape-scale factors on the richness, abundance, and distribution of primate populations across 42 rainforest fragments in the Valley. Given that we have now specifically observed the extirpation of six diurnal primates in several of these fragments across this region, we present a detailed report on the recent history and current status of diurnal primates in one large (2098ha) and three small (c. 500ha) fragments of the Valley. Finally, we speculate on some of the important alternative conservation strategies that should possibly be adopted to ensure the coexistence of nonhuman primates and humans in the rather precarious future of the last lowland rainforest fragments of the Brahmaputra Valley. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Assessment of irrigation requirement and scheduling under canal command area of Upper Ganga Canal using CropWat model,"The sustainable water resources utilization in deferent water-based sectors is a prerequisite for any country. Agriculture water demand in the agro-climatic zone of western Uttar Pradesh is accessed in the current study. From last few decades water scarcity is a serious issue for the government and policy makers in the region. Proper water management is crucial to economize not only the water use efficiency in the region, but also improve the crop productivity efficiently. This study determined the optimum irrigation area and its other irrigation requirements in the Upper Ganga Canal command. Irrigation scheduling was also recommended using CropWat 8.0 simulation software. It is estimated that the total crop water requirement in command area is 1763 MCM which seems higher than actual water availability due to poor planning and practice of irrigation. The proposed irrigation requirements based on results are appraised with the presently followed recommendations and are discussed in details in the subsequent sections. The present study is useful for effective planning and management of irrigation water needs in UGC command area. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
The association between climatic factors and waterborne infectious outbreaks with a focus on vulnerability in Pakistan: integrative review,"Climate change affects the spread of waterborne infectious diseases, yet research on vulnerability to outbreaks remains limited. This integrative review examines how climate variables (temperature and precipitation) relate to human vulnerability factors in Pakistan. By 2060, mean temperatures are projected to rise from 21.68°C (2021) to 30°C, with relatively stable precipitation. The epidemiological investigation in Pakistan identified Diarrhea (119,000 cases/year), Malaria (2.6 million cases/year), and Hepatitis (A and E) as the most prevalent infections. This research highlighted vulnerability factors, including poverty (52% of the population), illiteracy (59% of the population), limited healthcare accessibility (55% of the population), malnutrition (38% of the population), dietary challenges (48% of the population), as well as exposure to water pollution (80% of the population) and air pollution (55% of the population). The findings suggest that the coordinated strategies are vital across health, environmental, meteorological, and social sectors, considering climatic variability patterns and population vulnerability determinants. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Driving Analysis and Multi Scenario Simulation of Ecosystem Carbon Storage Changes Based on the InVEST-PLUS Coupling Model: A Case Study of Jianli City in the Jianghan Plain of China,"The carbon storage capacity of terrestrial ecosystems serves as a crucial metric for assessing ecosystem health and their resilience to climate change. By evaluating the effects of land use alterations on this storage, carbon management strategies can be improved, thereby promoting carbon reduction and sequestration. While county-level cities are pivotal to ecological conservation and high-quality development, they often face developmental challenges. Striking a balance between economic growth and meeting peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality objectives is particularly challenging. Consequently, there is an urgent need to bolster research into carbon storage management. The study focuses on Jianli City, employing the InVEST model and land use data to examine the response patterns of land use changes and terrestrial system carbon storage from 2000 to 2020. Using the PLUS model, the study simulated the land use and carbon storage in Jianli City for the year 2035 under three scenarios: Natural Development scenario, Urban Expansion scenario, and Ecology and food security scenario. Our findings indicate the following: (1) Between 2000 and 2020, significant shifts in land use were observed in Jianli City. These changes predominantly manifested as the interchange between Cropland and Water areas and the enlargement of impervious surfaces, leading to a decrease of 691,790.27 Mg in carbon storage. (2) Under the proposed scenarios—Natural Development scenario, Urban Expansion scenario, and Ecology and food security scenario—the estimated carbon storage capacities in Jianli City were 39.95 Tg, 39.90 Tg, and 40.14 Tg, respectively. When compared with the 2020 data, all these estimates showed an increase. In essence, our study offers insights into optimizing land use structures from a carbon storage standpoint to ensure stability in Jianli’s carbon storage levels while mitigating the risks associated with carbon fixation. This has profound implications for the harmonious evolution of regional eco-economies. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Financing energy transition in COVID-19 for energy efficiency: Does mitigation of energy price risk that essential?,"The aim of the study is to test the nexus between energy prices risk and energy efficiency for energy transition to recommend the implication for the period of COVID-19 crises. This study uses short-term daily data of G-20 countries for COVID-19 crises was taken to better estimate the study findings. To estimate the results Data Envelopment Analysis estimation method was applied for empirical inference. The findings revealed that the COVID-19 crises have the biggest negative influence with 47.1% on oil prices which raised energy prices risk at large. The aforementioned results hold even after substituting the magnitude of extreme list of variables, re-estimating the equations with energy efficiency. Such risk has further halted energy efficiency with 33.69% in G-20 countries during COVID-19 which is one of the largest dent of the mankind history. Our results also inferred that the relationship of energy prices risk with energy efficiency remained significant but negative with energy transition. Extending to it, the post-COVID-19, the danger of energy stock price crashes is expected to diminish dramatically. The study suggest that the corporations must participate in greater corporate social responsibility activities have lower post-COVID-19 energy price collapse risk. Finally, we demonstrate that post-COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on energy price collapse risk. Copyright © 2022 Shao and Wang.",Not About Sufficiency
"A community based model of environmental resource conservation and livelihoods: Non-Governmental Organisation supported Tšenekeng Botanical Garden in Semonkong, Lesotho","Environmental degradation in Lesotho has resulted in decreasing arable land that has adversely affected agricultural productivity and food security. As a response to the declining food production, many people are making a living out of their environmental resources. Some people harvest the medicinal plants from the communal land for sale. As a result, some of the valuable environmental resources and particularly the medicinal plants are now depleted due to over-harvesting. As a response to protecting the depleting environmental resources, governments and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) have implemented community based resources conservation projects. On the one hand, many government conservation programmes have followed an autocratic approach that imposes projects on the community. On the other hand, NGOs are complimented for including the affected communities in decision making process through different participatory methods. In this regard, this research paper assesses the contribution of local NGO's (Serumula Development Association) community based environmental resources conservation programme, Tšenekeng Botanical Garden to environmental conservation and livelihood making. © 2019 AJHTL.",Not About Sufficiency
A mega-index for the Americas and its underlying sustainable development correlations,"Indicators and their composite indices have been embraced as development tools for guiding humanity toward a sustainable destination. In response, public and private organizations have generated hundreds of these metrics, making their application overwhelming to policymakers, planners, and scientists. Past reviews have revealed that a majority of common development indices have theoretical or quantitative shortcomings, supporting that there is no consensus regarding their theoretical basis, design, use, thresholds-of-effect, or validation. In response, this study was designed around four guiding research questions: (i) What are the underlying development themes within a collection of established sustainability indices, and what distinguishes winning locations from losing ones? (ii) Are the three major divisions of sustainability (economic growth, social equity, environmental integrity) equally represented by current sustainable development measuring initiatives? (iii) Could just a few common and freely available indicators capture all present dimensions of sustainable development? (iv) Would a new sustainable development mega-index research paradigm improve humanity's ability to assess progress toward sustainability? Those questions were investigated using data from 30 mostly contiguous Western Hemisphere nations and three amassing methodological objectives. First, 31 known indices were reduced into underlying dimensions (factors) of sustainable development. Next, those factors were combined (aggregated) into the first mega-index of sustainable development (MISD). Finally, 11 common development indicators were explored regarding collinearity and explanatory power of the sustainable development dimensions and MISD. Seven latent dimensions (sub-metrics) captured over 85% of the variation of the original 31 indices, with socioeconomic themes dwarfing environmental ones. The factors conveyed: (F1) socioeconomic well-being synergies; (F2) economic freedom and democracy; (F3) environmentally efficient happiness; (F4) ecosystem well-being; (F5) peace to economic vulnerability tradeoff; (F6) natural resources protection; and (F7) environmental stewardship and risk resilience. MISD is the geometric mean of the seven sub-metrics, which were directed toward sustainability, and rescaled (normalized) 0 (worst case) to 100 (best case). Geographically, this study ranked Belize best overall, followed by Guyana, Panama, Uruguay, and Canada; Barbados ranked worst, preceded by Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico, and Cuba. Winning countries were characterized by low population density, increased forestland, decreased urban, and larger country area. Child mortality and population growth rate remained negative predictors of socioeconomic conditions; however per-capita CO2 sacrificed ecological integrity for improved human well-being. Mega-index creation will serve as an important scientific stepping-stone for improving accuracy and simplifying valuations of sustainable development, thus others should follow. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Underutilized and Under Threat: Environmental Policy as a Tool to Address Diabetes Risk,"Purpose of Review: Diabetes is a burgeoning threat to public health in the USA. Importantly, the burden of diabetes is not equally borne across society with marked disparities based on geography, race/ethnicity, and income. The etiology of global and population-specific diabetes risk remains incompletely understood; however, evidence linking environmental toxicants acting as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as particulate matter and arsenic, with diabetes suggests that environmental policies could play an important role in diabetes risk reduction. Recent Findings: Evidence suggests that disproportionate exposures to EDCs may contribute to subgroup-specific diabetes risk; however, no federal policies regulate EDCs linked to diabetes based upon diabetogenic potential. Nevertheless, analyses of European Union data indicate that such regulation could reduce diabetes-associated costs and disease burden. Summary: Federal laws only regulate EDCs indirectly. The accumulating evidence linking these chemicals with diabetes risk should encourage policymakers to adopt stricter environmental standards that consider both health and economic impacts. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable development in hydro-drought regions by improving hydro-indicators,Water scarcity and its upcoming consequences threaten hydro-drought-affected cities. Protection and improvement of urban water resources for the sake of resilient and sustainable urban development are necessary. Predicting the trend of hydro-drought in a case study city with statistical data assists in mitigating the threat. Eleven hydro-drought variables contribute to analytical surveys about urban hydro-sustainability from the past to the present and the future. This perusal suggests a mathematical model that predicts the future of urban water resources. It introduces projects to improve the situation of drought-affected cities by maintaining and saving local water resources. The assumption is that water resources conservation projects based on strategic planning will change current failed urban development to a progressive outlook in resiliency. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Crop production in response to elevated CO2: grain yield and quality,"The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has almost doubled since the preindustrial era due to global climate change and is expected to further increase if the current emission rates are not controlled. The impacts of elevated CO2 (e[CO2]) on growth, development, and yield of plant species, particularly crops, are very important concerns for the scientist. This is due to dynamic implications on global agricultural production and food security in the climate change scenario. Crops respond to the e[CO2] by stimulating the photosynthetic rate. which boosts crop yield. Higher levels of atmospheric carbon act like a carbon fertilizer for the plants and results in an increase in plant growth and productivity. Cereal crops grow larger in size and exhibit faster growth rates under e[CO2], and biomass production becomes higher. Crops have evolved strategies to enhance their physiological performance by increasing water use efficiency and reducing the transpirational water loss as well as lowering stomatal conductance under e[CO2]. C3 plants exhibit considerably higher increases in yield due to e[CO2] ranging from 20% and 35% as compared to C4 crops with only 10% to 15%. e[CO2] influences the qualitative attributes of crops, including the concentration of nutrients, which are fundamental food quality attributes having diverse implications on agricultural production, market value of crops as well as impacts on human health. Sharp declines are projected in the protein content and free amino acid of cereals under e[CO2] conditions. Under realistic field conditions experiments, free-air CO2 enrichment technology revealed significant increases in the photosynthesis activity, leaf carbohydrates, starch and sugars whereas the concentration of nitrogen per unit leaf mass has been found to decrease. The relative yield responses of grain crops under e[CO2] might increase under limiting nutrient and water conditions due to physiological adaptations. The major C3 cereals, including wheat and rice, undergo major shifts in physiological responses and C:N metabolism in response to e[CO2], However, a reduction in nutritional quality under e[CO2] appears to be a major challenge. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

"Nexus between Climate-Smart Livestock Production Practices and Farmers’ Nutritional Security in Pakistan: Exploring Level, Linkages, and Determinants","Livestock plays a vital role in humans’ food and nutrition security under rapidly changing climatic scenarios. This study investigates the nature and factors affecting livestock farmers’ choices of climate-smart livestock practices by using a multivariate probit model and then estimates the average effect of these adopted strategies on per capita daily dietary (calorie, protein, and calcium) intake among livestock herders. For this purpose, data were collected from 196 livestock farmers residing in the Punjab province of Pakistan, selected through multistage purposive and random sampling. The Simpson diversity index results revealed that farmers used diversified food in their daily diet. The results also showed that farmers consumed more protein-rich food items as compared to calorie and calcium-rich food items in their daily diet. Moreover, the average per capita calorie intake of livestock farmers was 2413.19 kcal/day. Livestock farmers adopting a higher number of climate-smart livestock practices consumed more daily per capita calories, protein, and calcium compared to those who adopted a lower number of climate-smart livestock practices on livestock farms. Moreover, climate-smart livestock practices produced more and better nutritional outcomes in combination with each other than in isolation. Livestock training was found to be positively associated with the adoption of more climate-smart practices. Therefore, livestock training is necessary to expedite the adoption of climate-smart practices and to improve the nutritional security of the farmers. © 2022 by the authors.

Introducing a Novel Hybrid Agent-Based Framework for Simulating the Adoption of Residential Water Conservation Behaviors,"Promoting household adoption of water conservation behaviors (WCBs) has emerged as a vital strategic response to address water scarcity. Nevertheless, it is imperative to recognize that acceptance of residential WCBs relies on households' voluntary engagement, as are interventions designed to encourage households to become involved in such actions. Meanwhile, environmental psychology plays a key role in understanding individuals' WCBs and exploring the psychosocial determinants underlying these behaviors. Furthermore, the spread of technology and behavior among a population are known as a complex adaptive system (CAS), and agent-based modeling (ABM) offers a comprehensive and practical approach to studying CASs. Hence, the main aim of the present research is to introduce a novel, hybrid agent-based framework for simulating the adoption of residential WCBs, in which an extended model of the theory of planned behavior acts as household agents' behavioral rule for adopting water-efficiency behaviors (WEBs). The framework is also grounded in various theories rooted in psychological and social sciences. Moreover, the presented framework integrates ABM and structural equation modeling approaches. Although this study mainly focuses on WEBs, the framework includes a mechanism to update agents' water use based on their adoption level of water curtailment behaviors. Thus, the presented framework allows for simultaneously but separately exploring the preferred level of both types of WCBs among household agents. Finally, total water consumption is systematically calculated based on agents' aggregated behavior. © World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2023.All rights reserved",Not About Sufficiency
A comprehensive and systematic study of geothermal energy-based desalination systems for sustainable development,"Context: Geothermal energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources as it is a power source that produces electricity with minimal environmental impact. It has been proven that among renewable energy sources, it is the most reliable, safe, and clean, and therefore it is used for power production, heating, and cooling. The importance of geothermal desalination is beneficial in areas lacking natural groundwater or surface water supplies. Over time, water reuse desalination can solve water scarcity and, in some countries, provides over 90 % of the total water supply. The novelty of the work: This research presents an in-depth analysis of the desalination of seawater utilizing geothermal energy as the primary resource. It will also evaluate the risks and market possibilities of the system and the constraints on further development. Methodology: The method of geothermal desalination has also been briefly covered, along with the most common cycles of thermal desalination. These cycles include multi-effect distillation, multistage flash distillation, and vapor compression. Main results and related interpretations: Geothermal desalination technologies address worldwide water scarcity sustainably and effectively. Geothermal energy can make desalination more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Compared to conventional fossil fuel-based systems, desalination using geothermal energy can result in lower overall energy usage and CO2 emissions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

"Does Household Capital Mediate the Uptake of Agricultural Land, Crop, and Livestock Adaptations? Evidence From the Indo-Gangetic Plains (India)","Farmers in the Indo-Gangetic Plains produce much of the wheat and rice grown in India. However, food production and millions of farm-based livelihoods in this region will continue to be adversely affected by hydro-climatic change and variation, reduced land productivity, and declining groundwater levels. Thus, agricultural adaptations are essential for protecting and improving upon intersecting goals of food security, poverty alleviation, and wellbeing. Household “capital” (e.g., natural, human, financial, physical, and social) is commonly cited as an indicator of livelihood adaptability and innovation. We develop a series of mediated structural equation models to empirically evaluate the validity of capital as a suitable indicator for adaptation and adaptive capacity. These models assess the extent to which household capital mediates the relationship between over 1,000 socio-economically differentiated and randomly selected farm households, and their crop, livestock, and land management adaptations in the states of Haryana and Bihar. Central to our models is a single household capital variable, constructed by aggregating nearly 80 different measurements of households' (i) physical/infrastructural capital, (ii) owned or accessed assets, (iii) livelihood diversity, (iv) ability to reach market or commercialize, (v) access to weather information, and (vi) social capital. We find household capital is a significant predictor in adopting crop, land management, and livestock-related adaptation strategies across both states. Second, and in certain cases, lower castes and less educated households engaged in fewer agricultural adaptations—an outcome mediated by their lower composition of capital. Further, and across almost all contexts, household capital mediated the effect of owning a greater proportion of land, and the higher uptake of agricultural adaptation activities. While improvements in any capital category can improve adoption, we recommend programs that improve (i) access to public and private agricultural infrastructure for lower castes; (ii) education and shared knowledge spaces for less-educated households; and (iii) the availability of low-interest loans and the more efficient legal transfer of land for agriculturalists owning a smaller proportion of their land. Through this novel and large-scale analysis of household data, we provide short-term and immediate recommendations for more equitable agricultural adaptation in this breadbasket region of northern India. © Copyright © 2019 Shah, Wagner, Sanga, Park, Demange, Gueiros and Niles.",Not About Sufficiency
Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi as a Plant Growth Stimulant in a Tomato and Onion Intercropping System,"Climate change has challenged large-scale crop production at a global level. Global temperature increases, water scarcity, and a further reduction in cultivable land resources due to anthropogenic impacts have resulted in the need to redesign agricultural systems such as intercropping to maximize the efficient use of natural resources. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) represent an underexplored area, not only in terms of an alternative to the heavy use of chemical fertilizers, but also as a natural resource used to enhance physiological processes and mitigate the variations in biotic and abiotic factors in plants. On the other hand, the combined use of AMF with suitable but cheaper and environmentally friendly growth substrates is another way to maximize crop production. A study was carried out in a tomato and onion intercropped pattern system to analyze the above- and belowground implications of two AMF commercial products containing Rhizophagus irregularis, propagated in soil and with an in vitro technique addition, with two different mixed growth substrates (river sand and compost) under greenhouse conditions. Overall, both AMF products overall showed significant promoting effects on plant growth (15–30%) and root parameters (50%) in the tomato and onion plants on the sand-mixed substrate. Moreover, the soil-propagated AMF also showed significant positive effects on chlorophyll content (35%), photosynthetic activity, and the accumulation of macro- and micronutrients, especially the Fe and Mn contents (60–80%) in the tomato plants. We present evidence of the benefits to plant performance due to the interactive effects between AMF and the growth substrate, and these positive effects might be due to the intercropping system. Hence, soil-propagated Rhizophagus irregularis is represented here as a promising candidate for enhancing growth, sustainability, and productivity under greenhouse conditions. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Half the world’s population are exposed to increasing air pollution,"Air pollution is high on the global agenda and is widely recognised as a threat to both public health and economic progress.

Recently, there have been major advances in methods that allow the quantification of air pollution-related indicators to track progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and that expand the evidence base of the impacts of air pollution on health. Despite efforts to reduce air pollution in many countries there are regions, notably Central and Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, in which populations continue to be exposed to increasing levels of air pollution. The majority of the world’s population continue to be exposed to levels of air pollution substantially above WHO Air Quality Guidelines and, as such, air pollution constitutes a major, and in many areas, increasing threat to public health. © 2020, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Social and ecological trade offs in combating land degradation: The case of invasion by a woody shrub (Euryops Floribundus) at Macubeni, South Africa","Woody plant invasions, either of alien or indigenous species, are deemed to result in loss of ecosystem goods and services in many areas throughout the world, resulting in significant degradation and economic costs. Invasion of Euryops floribundus, a species indigenous to South Africa, is perceived to have reduced the grazing available for domestic livestock. Consequently, a programme of manual eradication has been implemented to improve the grazing resource and provide jobs for poverty alleviation. However, there is potential for a conflict of interest as our study shows that almost all households rely on Euryops for fuel and at times fencing material, whereas only a minority of households own livestock. Moreover, comparison of invaded and non-invaded sites indicated that the invaded sites harbour greater plant species richness and higher grass culm density per unit area of grass cover, as well as higher forb and litter cover. While invaded sites had lower grass cover, overall plant cover was no different between invaded and non-invaded sites. Multivariate analysis indicated no obvious differentiation in community composition between invaded and non-invaded areas, suggesting stronger drivers of community composition other than Euryops invasion presumed to be facilitated by the effects of high livestock densities. Overall, our study suggests that the clearing operation may well benefit from a better understanding of the social needs, perceptions of degradation by the various stakeholders and ecological dynamics of the area, especially local reliance on the resources, and the dynamics of the invasion, particularly its extent, rate of spread and susceptibility for re-invasion in the cleared areas.

A sustainable urban water management model under uncertainty: a case study,"Purpose: Tackling the challenges of water scarcity requires comprehensive management according to financial, environmental and social issues. This paper aims to develop a planning approach for systematic decision-making and pay attention to uncertainties in water demand management and supply investment. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents a multiobjective optimization model to manage water resources based on the balance of supply and demand. The objectives of the model include economic, social and environmental (sustainable development) factors. The model achieves an optimal urban water portfolio by using a scenario tree. Findings: The mathematical goal programming (GP) in a multiobjective optimization model is applied and solved by the branch and bound method. The results indicate the selected supply augmentation and demand management options in each stage for 20 years according to the dry, normal and wetness year scenarios. Practical implications: This model is based on a real-world case and has been implemented in the city of Karaj. It can be applied for water management of other cities concerning sustainable development as well. Originality/value: This paper innovates by considering the sustainable development criteria that are defined using three objective functions, including economic, social and environmental factors. The balance of supply and demand concerning uncertainty has not been investigated in any urban water portfolios. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) is incorporated to generate different scenarios.

Mitigation of excessive solar radiation and water stress on ‘keitt’ mango mangifera indica trees through shading,"Excessive solar radiation “global warming” and water scarcity are consider the main environmental constraints for plant growth and production under arid and semi-arid regions. The current research was aimed to study the effect of irrigation levels (100%, 85%, 70% of irrigation requirements), and shading levels (60%, 40%, 0%) on the growth and productivity of ‘Keitt’ mango trees. This experiment was conducted during two growing seasons (2016/2017 and 2017/2018) at El Behera Governorate, Egypt. Decreasing irrigation level (IR) decreased leaf area, malformed panicle, powdery mildew infection, final fruit set, fruit numbers, yield but it increased chlorophyll content, proline content, leaf water content. While, increasing shading levels (SH) increased leaves number, leaf area, fruit set, powdery mildew infection, malformed panicle but it decreased fruit sunburn damage, proline content, chlorophyll content and relative water content. Moreover, accumulative effects of 85% IR + 40% SH significantly increased leaf area, fruit set, fruit number, yield, chlorophyll content, WUE, proline content, relative water content, leaf water content while decreasing powdery mildew and sunburn damage. Results suggest that shading at 40% increased the yield up to 20% and decreased sunburn damage up to 0% under irrigation level of 70%. Shading may be a new technique to alleviate the adverse effects of water stress beside their role in avoiding excessive solar radiation on ‘Keitt’ mango trees. © 2021, Wydawnictwo Akad Rolniczej W Lublinie.

Foliar fertilization with potassium silicate enhances water productivity and drought resilience in sugar beet,"Context: Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) is an essential industrial crop valued for its sugar production, especially in regions with limited water resources. Due to its lower water demands, sugar beet is favored over sugarcane in Egypt. We hypothesized that foliar application of potassium silicate (K₂SiO₃) would enhance sugar beet's physiological responses, yield, and water productivity under drought and saline conditions, offering an eco-friendly solution to optimize crop performance in semi-arid regions. Objectives: This study aimed to (i) investigate the impact of foliar-applied K2SiO3 on the physiological, biochemical, and anatomical traits of sugar beet under drought stress in saline soils, (ii) evaluate the effects of K2SiO3 on agronomic traits, root and sugar yields, and water productivity under different irrigation regimes, and (iii) assess K2SiO3 to mitigate the adverse effects of drought and salinity, enhancing sugar beet resilience and productivity. Methods: Field experiments were conducted over two winter seasons at Fayoum University, Fayoum, Egypt, to assess the impact of three irrigation regimes (DIR0%, DIR25%, DIR50%) and three foliar K₂SiO₃ concentrations (0, 10, 20 mmol L−1) on sugar beet (cv. Baraca) in a split-plot arrangement based on a randomized complete block design (in triplicates). Physiological parameters, such as leaf water content, membrane stability, chlorophyll fluorescence, osmolyte accumulation, and antioxidant enzyme activities, were measured. Agronomic traits, including root yield, white sugar yield, and crop water productivity (WPc), were also evaluated. Results: In general, drought stress negatively impacted physio-biochemical and anatomical traits, nutrient uptake, growth, sugar yield, and quality of sugar beet. This was evidenced by the significantly (P<0.05) increased levels of osmolytes and antioxidants (enzymatic and non-enzymatic), which indicated the plant's defensive/adaptive responses to drought stress. However, K2SiO3 effectively alleviated the adverse effects of deficit irrigation. Notably, the interaction of DIR0% × KSi-20 resulted in the highest root yield (88.97 t ha−1) and sugar yield (14.43 t ha−1), while the highest WPc (24.48 kg m−3) was achieved in the DIR50% × KSi-20 treatment. Conclusions: Foliar application of K₂SiO₃ effectively alleviates drought and salinity stress in sugar beet by improving physiological and biochemical traits. The treatment enhances photosynthetic efficiency, osmolyte accumulation, antioxidant activity, and nutrient uptake, leading to improved crop yield and quality. Implications: This study highlights K₂SiO₃ as a cost-effective, eco-friendly strategy to enhance sugar beet resilience in arid and saline environments. Integrating K₂SiO₃ into crop management practices could contribute to sustainable sugar production, particularly in regions facing water scarcity and soil salinity challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Comparison of drip and sprinkler irrigation strategies on sunflower seed and oil yield and quality under Mediterranean climatic conditions,"This study compares the effects of different irrigation regimes on seed yield and oil yield quality and water productivity of sprinkler and drip irrigated sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) on silty-clay-loam soils in 2006 and 2007 in the Mediterranean region of Turkey. In sprinkler irrigation a line-source system was used in order to create gradually varying irrigation levels. Irrigation regimes consisted of full irrigation (I1) and three deficit irrigation treatments (I2, I3 and I4), and rain-fed treatment (I5). In the drip system, irrigation regimes included full irrigation (FI-100), three deficit irrigation treatments (DI-25, DI-50, DI-75), partial root zone drying (PRD-50) and rain-fed treatment (RF). Irrigations were scheduled at weekly intervals both in sprinkler and drip irrigation, based on soil water depletion within a 0.90m root zone in FI-100 and I1 plots. Irrigation treatments influenced significantly (P<0.01) sunflower seed and oil yields, and oil quality both with sprinkler and drip systems. Seed yields decreased with increasing water stress levels under drip and sprinkler irrigation in both experimental years. Seed yield response to irrigation varied considerably due to differences in soil water contents and spring rainfall distribution in the experimental years. Although PRD-50 received about 36% less irrigation water as compared to FI-100, sunflower yield was reduced by an average of 15%. PRD-50 produced greater seed and oil yields than DI-50 in the drip irrigation system. Yield reduction was mainly due to less number of seeds per head and lower seed mass. Soil water deficits significantly reduced crop evapotranspiration (ET), which mainly depends on irrigation amounts. Significant linear relationships (R2=0.96) between ET and oil yield (Y) were obtained in each season. The seed yield response factors (kyseed) were 1.24 and 0.86 for the sprinkler and 1.19 and 1.06 for the drip system in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The oil yield response factor (kyoil) for sunflower was found to be 1.08 and 1.49 for both growing seasons for the sprinkler and 1.36 and 1.25 for the drip systems, respectively. Oil content decreased with decreasing irrigation amount. Consistently greater values of oil content were obtained from the full irrigation treatment plots. The saturated (palmitic and stearic acid) and unsaturated (oleic and linoleic acid) fatty acid contents were significantly affected by water stress. Water stress caused an increase in oleic acid with a decrease in linoleic acid contents. The palmitic and stearic acid concentrations decreased under drought conditions. Water productivity (WP) values were significantly affected by irrigation amounts and ranged from 0.40 to 0.71kgm-3 in 2006, and from 0.69 to 0.91kgm-3 in 2007. The PRD-50 treatment resulted in the greatest WP (1.0kgm-3) and irrigation water productivity (IWP) (1.4kgm-3) in both growing seasons. The results revealed that under water scarcity situation, PRD-50 in drip and I2 in sprinkler system provide acceptable irrigation strategies to increase sunflower yield and quality. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Growing grassroots innovations: Exploring the role of community-based initiatives in governing sustainable energy transitions,"The challenges of sustainable development (and climate change and peak oil, in particular) demand system-wide transformations in sociotechnical systems of provision. An academic literature around coevolutionary innovation for sustainability has recently emerged as an attempt to understand the dynamics and directions of such sociotechnical transformations, which are termed 'sustainability transitions'. This literature has previously focused on market-based technological innovations. Here we apply it to a new context of civil-society-based social innovation and examine the role of community-based initiatives in a transition to a low-carbon sustainable economy in the UK. We present new empirical research from a study of the UK's Transition Towns movement (a 'grassroots innovation') and assess its attempts to grow and influence wider societal sociotechnical systems. By applying strategic niche management theory to this civil society context, we deliver theoretically informed practical recommendations for this movement to diffuse beyond its niche: to foster deeper engagement with resourceful regime actors; to manage expectations more realistically by delivering tangible opportunities for action and participation; and to embrace a community-based, action-oriented model of social change (in preference to a cognitive theory of behaviour change). Furthermore, our study indicates areas where theory can be refined to better explain the growth and broader impacts of grassroots innovations -namely, through a fuller appreciation of the importance of internal niche processes, by understanding the important role of identity and group formation, and by resolving how social practices change in grassroots innovations. © 2012 Pion and its Licensors.",Not About Sufficiency
Cities and climate co-benefits,"The New Urban Agenda (NUA) was launched during Habitat III, the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, which took place in Quito, Ecuador, from 17 to 20 October 2016. This was one of the major global policy deliberations after the negotiation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. A key challenge remains how to actualize development goals without exacerbating the causes and consequences of climate change. Cities in developing countries particularly face an uphill task to become sustainable. Most of the climate research and action in the developed world like the US, Europe and Japan focused on mitigation strategies. Cities in developing countries until recently have had a limited research on climate response, that too pre-occupied with adaptation agenda. The co-benefit approach tries to bridge this gap, with integration of mitigation and adaptation agendas, vertical and horizontal coordination between sectors and scales of intervention. In this regard, India and other rapidly developing countries have the historical chance of following a different path of urban development. There are tremendous opportunities to harness massive urban climate co-benefits, which will be the only way to improve the well-being of the existing and growing number of urban dwellers without threatening the health of the planet and its inhabitants. This research will present a conceptual framework to investigate the different aspects of climate co-benefits relevant for Indian cities. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
Co-benefits from the energy sector,"With the onset of climate change on the horizon of human civilization, from the 1990s onwards, research in the interphase of economy, energy and environment (read emissions), collectively known as the E3 nexus is increasingly gaining focus in academics and policy-making. Since 2009, when the world became more urban than rural, there seems to be a growing interest to study how this E3 nexus operates in urban areas. In the absence of any previous investigations on E3 linkages in India, this study proceeds on the research premise that E3 challenges are most crucially played out in urban areas, that possibly seek concerted technological and policy-oriented interventions to produce climate co-benefits. The chapter reviews global literature to theoretically comprehend E3 linkages in urban settlements. This is followed by a detailed study on present conditions, issues and challenges of India’s economy, energy and environment (emission) sectors. The research underscores the role of urban India in these three sectors and generates for the first time, superimposed scenarios of the nexus. The study culminates with a discussion on appropriate technology and policy/governance instruments that could possibly mitigate impacts and produce co-benefits in urban areas. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
Building climate-resilient health systems in Sierra Leone: addressing the dual burden of infectious and climate-related diseases,"Climate change presents a profound challenge to global health, disproportionately affecting low-income countries like Sierra Leone. This opinion examines the dual burden of infectious and climate-related diseases and their implications for Sierra Leone’s health systems. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns intensify vector-borne diseases such as malaria and Lassa fever, while flooding exacerbates waterborne diseases in overcrowded urban areas. Concurrently, climate-driven food insecurity worsens malnutrition, particularly among children, and heat stress contributes to the growing prevalence of non-communicable diseases. These overlapping health crises strain Sierra Leone’s fragile health system, characterized by inadequate infrastructure, workforce shortages, weak surveillance systems, and limited financial resources. The dual disease burden not only increases morbidity and mortality but also deepens existing health inequities and inequalities. To address these challenges, this opinion underscores the need for climate-resilient health policies and systems. Key recommendations include strengthening healthcare infrastructure, building workforce capacity through targeted training, fostering community-based adaptation strategies, and enhancing international collaboration and financing. Establishing robust research and data systems is also critical to monitor and mitigate climate-related health impacts. By prioritizing response to dual burden of infectious and climate-related diseases within health policy frameworks, Sierra Leone can build a resilient health system that safeguards public health and promotes sustainable development. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Farming system of food crop keep going to produce on a time climate change and COVID-19 Pandemic in Timor-Indonesia,"Each body needs some foods to consume every day. But to produce food in all region face many factors as challenges. Challenges that farmers always face in the dryland region are limited water for supplying to crop, and the soil has low fertile and low input production into manage farming system. In addition, producing food crops on the COVID-19 Pandemic face new challenges like the availability of input production, distribution, and marketing of products. However, food production should be prepared to fulfil human needs. The research objectives are (1) to know farmers' activity on the food crop farming system. (2) to know the way farmer's availability input production, distribution, and marketing of product. And (3) to know the productivity of food crops on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This research used to survey and observation Method to the farming system that farmers do. This research shows that farmers always are doing their farming system of food crop despite happen climate change, especially have no rain for a long time and the COVID-19 Pandemic. For doing their farming intensively, farmers should get input production from distribution agents. And farmers' success in selling their product in the local market. However, products that should be sold on the other island or products for the industry market often face challenges, especially transportation. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Materiality assessment: the case of Latin American listed companies,"Purpose: This paper aims to propose a measurement of the materiality of environmental, social and governance information (ESG) reported by listed companies belonging to sensitive industries in Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Argentina. This analysis is carried out from the insights of stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory and institutional theory. The research questions addressed are: What type of information is considered as material by Latin American companies? Does this information respond to the environmental and social issues within the context of Latin American companies and the needs of their stakeholders? Design/methodology/approach: A materiality index is developed from principal component analysis and factor analysis, which are multivariate analysis statistical techniques used in various fields to develop indices. The designed index examines materiality in the sustainability reports of 65 companies for 2017 and 67 companies for 2018. These firms belong to the energy, mining, chemical, construction, construction materials and public services industries in Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. Findings: The results show medium-high materiality indices, mostly in Chilean, Mexican and Colombian companies. In addition, issues such as water management, climate change and occupational health and safety are particularly interesting for companies. For the two years studied and from the perspective of material aspects for the company and its stakeholders, energy, mining and utilities (drinking water and sewage) sectors obtained the highest scores. This shows that the disclosure of ESG information is higher in industries related to the exploitation of natural resources that cause adverse effects on the environment such as extractive industries. Both the analysis presented in this paper and the materiality measurement developed, allow social responsibility managers to have a standard on the level of importance allotted to the different topics disclosed in sustainability reports. Additionally, this study provides a perspective of the material issues recognized by sensitive industries with great environmental impact. Similarly, an analysis of the issues considered material by stakeholders is provided. This allows such issues to be compared, identifying similarities and differences among the issues regarded as material by a company and its stakeholders. Practical implications: The paper opens the debate is open as to whether the information disclosed response to the needs of stakeholders or whether, on the contrary, the materiality analysis is a process that emerges simply from the interests of the company. These demands for qualitative and field research to complement quantitative studies such as this one to research the stakeholders’ engagement processes in context. Social implications: The paper’s purpose a challenge for future research is to strengthen the use of various methodologies that allow knowing the participation processes in the definition of materiality in the ESG information and the companies’ engagement with stakeholders. This stimulates research in the region, which is still in its infancy. Originality/value: The international literature contains few studies related to the assessment of materiality for sustainability reporting. So this paper contributes proposes measurement of materiality for ESG information. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency

"Livelihood and ecosystem benefits of carbon credits through rainforests: A case study of Hiniduma Bio-link, Sri Lanka","There is growing acceptance that the environmental and livelihood-improvement benefits of forests extend beyond the mitigation of climate change. Forest reforestation programmes that are typically motivated only by carbon benefits also have the potential to improve livelihoods, reduce gender disparities, and provide non-carbon ecosystem benefits with appropriate targeting of land selection and involvement of local communities in governance. The Hiniduma Bio-link Project is owned and maintained by Conservation Carbon Company in Sri Lanka. Apart from the direct benefit of forest protection on decreasing carbon emissions and increasing carbon sequestration, forest projects yield indirect benefits called co-benefits that can be linked to the national agenda of the SDGs and beyond-carbon impacts of forest carbon projects that are often of equal or greater importance to buyers of emissions reductions. Our project, the Hiniduma Bio-link, offers value-added carbon credits for socially and environmentally conscious organisations and individuals. It is a reforestation project to establish a biodiversity corridor between two large protected remnant Sri Lankan rainforest patches – Singharaja and Kanneliya. In addition to mitigating the broader issue of climate change, the project helps to (1) conserve limited rainforest groves by providing buffers and a safe corridor between the two protected forest patches to help reduce threats to local biodiversity and wildlife from adjacent human communities, and (2) improve livelihoods of local farmers and landholders by providing training and income generating opportunities. The Bio-link Project accomplishes this through the reforestation of traditional farmers’ home-gardens in the lowland wet zone region through analog forestry concept. Along with the baseline biomass estimation of the selected pilot phase project, the carbon savings from the newly planted trees were calculated and registered for carbon credits. The expected sequestration potential per hectare is 152.14 t CO2/ha after a 20% deduction for unexpected losses. The ecosystem services provided by the project are sold as Plan Vivo Certificates, which represent long-term carbon sequestration. Crediting period of the project is 15 years. A baseline survey was conducted in each land and the base-load was calculated to be 299.47 tCO2/ha. The certificates registered under the Plan Vivo registry for CO2 sequestrated from the newly planted trees are eligible to be sold as Voluntary Carbon Credits in the international market. The Hiniduma Bio-link Project is also the first project in Asia to complete a Plan Vivo. Plan Vivo is a standard for designing and certifying community based payments for ecosystem services (PES) programmes. One of the noteworthy successes of the project has been the sale of carbon credits from the Hiniduma Bio-link Project to Marks & Spencer, UK. Beyond-carbon impacts of creating just employment or saving habitat for an endangered species are actually the main motivators of the project, and the verified emissions reductions that result are themselves a “co”-benefit – and a means of leveraging carbon finance to implement project activities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Carbon pricing for sustainable transition in India,"Carbon pricing has become a major tool for addressing climate change and climate action (SDG13). Some 36 countries have implemented the carbon tax and 34 have incorporated Emissions Trading Systems (ETSs). Evidence shows an increase in inequality and employment, but it differs between countries and among sectors. As India is significantly large, the decision on carbon pricing will have its benefits, co-benefits, disadvantages and losses. India is in the process of leveraging technology with an eye on long-term sustainability. However, the transition trade-off may come with a development cost. Hence, the excessive fossil-fuel subsidies and increasing debt burdens should be eliminated, and green transformation of the industries should be prioritized. We address the urgency of carbon pricing introduction in India, and the pathways to implement carbon pricing for a sustainable future. The carbon taxes in India should be implemented according to the carbon-intensive nature of the industry and, it should also be paired with ETS and feebates for a just and equitable distribution of burden. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Social Projects and the Internalization of Sustainability and Social Responsibility: Concepts for the Improvement of Quality of Life,"Based on studies carried out in São Paulo State, Brazil, it was observed that several municipalities have faced huge environmental changes that can be noticed in places where sustainability of natural resources was not prioritized. It was observed the prevalence of an economic development model supported by technological megaprojects in areas of environmental conservation, which also represent areas prone to social and technological risks. The municipality of Bom Jesus dos Perdões, located in São Paulo State, showed very different average values for some social indicators in a set of municipalities of the region. The analysis of data on violence and crime, between 1996 and 2015, allows us to present a general local diagnosis that shows decreasing social security. Simultaneously, it allowed to identify how it is possible to reflect on social reality through two projects: (1) voluntary social work with children and adolescents at risk, through sports practices and (2) Integrated Management Office [Gabinete de Gestão Integrada]—GGI—a project created by the Brazilian Federal Government, of optional municipal adhesion, where it is proposed the integration of several local institutions aiming a joint management of public security.

Evaluation of a Harmonized Undergraduate Catalog for Veterinary Public Health and Food Hygiene Pedagogy in Europe,"Current and emerging veterinary public health (VPH) challenges raised by globalization, climate change, and industrialization of food production require the veterinarian’s role to evolve in parallel and veterinary education to adapt to reflect these changes. The European Food Hygiene catalog was developed to provide a list of topics relevant to Day One Competencies in VPH. A study was undertaken to ensure that the catalog and teaching practices were pertinent to the work of public health veterinarians. Relevant stakeholders were consulted using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. A long questionnaire was distributed to 49 academics teaching VPH in European veterinary schools to review topics listed in the catalog. Eighteen responses were received (36.7%), representing 12 European countries. There was general agreement that most topics were appropriate for the undergraduate VPH curriculum. A short questionnaire was distributed to 348 European veterinarians working in the industry. Twenty-four questionnaires (6.7%) were received, representing eight European countries. Despite the low participation rate, topics needing greater emphasis in the undergraduate curriculum included Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP), food microbiology, and audits. Seven semi-structured interviews with public health veterinarians working in the UK identified the need for curricular changes including greater practical experience and a shift from a focus on meat inspection to risk management. This may be partly achieved by replacing traditional lectures with authentic case-based scenarios. The study findings can be used to inform the future direction to VPH education for veterinary students across Europe. © American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges, 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Toxic sustainable companies: a critique on the shortcomings of current corporate sustainability ratings and a definition of ‘financial toxicity’,"Building on critical literature on corporate sustainability, we add a perspective thus far only scarcely addressed: the toxicity of financial practices and products generating systemic risk. We start with illustrative examples setting the stage for defining toxic assets and practices as revealed after the onset of the financial crisis precipitated by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. To illustrate corporate toxicity we use the ‘Global 100 Index’ from ‘Corporate Knights’ to show which (mostly financial) scandals or bailout cases were detected at corporations awarded a position in this prestigious sustainability rating. Next, we present examples of toxic products (Naked Credit Default Swaps and structured products) and practices (securitization and ratings). Based on the examples we derive the concept of ‘financial toxicity’ adopted from pharmacology as a meta-criterion, which, as we argue, should be added to the ESG (environment, society, governance) universe as well as to corporate social responsibility and Corporate Sustainability. We define financial toxicity as ‘the degree to which financial products can systematically harm their buyers and, on a large scale, the extent to which these products or financial practices generate systemic risk’. We discuss implications for theory development and the overall credibility of corporate sustainability ratings. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Modeling air quality regulation by green infrastructure in a Mediterranean coastal urban area: The removal of PM10 in the Metropolitan City of Naples (Italy),"The amelioration of air quality represents one of the most complex challenges that the European Union is facing today. Although a successful strategy to improve air quality should decisively act on pollution sources, Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) may provide a huge contribution to tackle air pollution, while delivering a wide range of Ecosystem Services and enhancing the Natural Capital. In this paper, we analyzed, in both biophysical and monetary terms, the role of the Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) in improving air quality in the Metropolitan City of Naples (Southern Italy) by implementing an accounting model of PM10 removal. Our findings indicate that about 1,148 Mg of PM10 were annually removed by the UGI, for a monetary value of 36 million euros per year. We also assessed the impact of a devastating wildfire that occurred in 2017 in the study area, which resulted in a loss of PM10 removal of about 97 Mg and led to an estimated monetary loss of 3 million euros per year. The results also showed that PM10 removal efficiency largely varies seasonally and across different functional groups of vegetation, highlighting the role of functional biodiversity in the provision of Ecosystem Services under Mediterranean climate conditions. In conclusion, we maintain that the biophysical and economic assessment of Ecosystem Services can support local managers and policymakers in charge of developing urban planning strategies aimed at ensuring sustainable development and human well-being in metropolitan cities. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency

Spatiotemporal variation of bacterial water quality and the relationship with pasture land cover,"Pathogens are a major cause of water quality impairment and public health concern world-wide. In the United States, each state is tasked with developing water quality standards (WQS) to protect the designated use(s) of waterbodies. Several streams in the Illinois River Watershed in northwest Arkansas are currently listed as impaired due to elevated levels of pathogens. Our objective was to evaluate Escherichia coli (E. coli) numbers at 29 stream sites, compare these numbers to the applicable WQS, and investigate the relationship between E. coli numbers and land cover variables. E. coli numbers in samples collected at most sites were within allowable limits, although there were several instances of violations of the WQS. Violations were variable from year to year at some sites, and elevated levels of E. coli were spatially localized during baseflow. Violations also were positively related to pasture land cover in the drainage area, and particularly within the riparian buffer area. This relationship was non-linear, or threshold based, where there was a significant increase in the mean E. coli exceedances when riparian pasture land cover was greater than approximately 50%. These results can be used to identify specific stream reaches where E. coli numbers might be elevated and the implementation of best management practices can be geographically targeted. © 2017 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
UN food summit tries to focus world attention on hunger.,"This article discusses the November 1996 World Food Summit in Rome, women's role as food producers, overconsumption, and justification for a world conference focus. The Summit was planned by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and is to focus on how to provide people with food security and how to keep pace with growing needs without causing environmental damage. The Summit takes place during a time when 841 million of the world population are chronically undernourished, of which 200 million are children. Millions more suffer from contaminated food and water, micronutrient deficiencies, and blindness due to lack of vitamin A. Agricultural production in 88 countries is deficient. These countries cannot produce enough food to feed their populations an adequate diet and cannot afford to import needed food. These countries include China, India, and most of sub-Saharan Africa. World grain stocks have dropped to low levels, export prices for cereals have risen, and the world fish harvest has leveled off. Over the next 50 years the world must raise food for about 4 billion more people with a limited supply of land and uneven water resources. African countries must increase food production by 300%, Latin America by 80%, Asia by 69%, and North America by 30%. The former strategy of increasing yields with fertilizers is no longer effective and there is no other alternative. In developing countries women are the main producers of food for the family. Future policies must recognize women's role in food production. Poverty would decrease and food supplies increase if poor women were given access to credit and technical advice, education and health care, and a place in the center of the world agenda for increasing food productivity. The global food system is inequitably concentrated among few, and the food trade is increasingly controlled by multinationals.

Strengthening International Water Security: The European Union’s proposal,"The UN World Health Organization reports that 80% of diseases are waterborne. Bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases like typhoid, cholera, amebiasis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis A, skin infection, and gastrointestinal are spread through polluted water. In 2013, the UN Water defined water security as “The capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability”. The notion is quite new, but it does not mean that international law does not include rules and principles relevant to water security. Compared to some other regions in the world, most people living in Europe already enjoy very good access to high-quality drinking water, in part thanks to over 30 years of European Union legislation for ensuring drinking water quality. On February 2018, pressed by the successful result of the first European Citizens' Initiative “Right2Water,” the European Commission proposed to revise the European Union legislation for improving access to higher quality of drinking water and provide better information to citizens. Considering the latest scientific knowledge and recommendations of the World Health Organization, the proposal made by the Commission suggests improving water quality by adding new and emerging substances (such as legionella and chlorate) to the list of criteria for determining water safety. The new provisions require the member states to improve access for all people, especially for vulnerable and marginalized groups who currently have difficult access to drinking water, set up equipment for access to drinking water in public spaces, launch campaigns to inform citizens about the quality of their water, and encourage administrations and public buildings to provide access to drinking water. According to the European Union Commission, the new measures would reduce potential health risks associated with drinking water from 4% to below 1%. Based on the presumption that the right to safe water, and the related concept of water security, emerges as a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the approach conducted by the European Commission and, compared it with a fragmented panorama in the International regulation. In this sense, it will be necessary to refer to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, its Protocol on Water and Health, the General Comment No. 15 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the right to water, and the World Health Organization’s Water safety plan to identify and manage the risks that climate change poses to water security (quality and quantity) in the framework of international law obligations. Finally, in order to consider future scenarios and promote possible implementation, the new European Union approach is fully consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In particular, the initiatives will make a meaningful contribution to reaching the Sustainable Development Goal 6 to “achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all,” along with the Paris Agreement objectives on climate change, thanks to safer, more efficient, and sustainable management of drinking water, reducing the CO2 footprint and unnecessary water loss. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization.

"Fossil fuel reform in developing states: The case of Trinidad and Tobago, a petroleum producing small Island developing State","Trinidad and Tobago is an oil exporting small island developing state (SIDS) with a 0.12% contribution to global emissions and with important socio-economic challenges. It has producer, electricity and transport fuel subsidies. It is at an interesting juncture in subsidy reform: the government faces the embeddedness of distributive justice norms that are contested by fiscal prudence and environmental stewardship norms. The value of the paper is twofold. First it develops a subsidy intractability framework to explain reform global narratives that highlights: the power of agents, the nature of contested economic, justice and environmental norms and the availability of mechanisms for reform. Second, this framework is used to explain reform narratives and trajectories in Trinidad and Tobago using data from public documents and from a unique elite survey of former and present heads of state, politicians, policy makers and stakeholders. Even in conditions of falling oil prices and national revenue and pressures to reduce emissions, where redistributive justice arguments are heavily embedded in public discourses, those aspects of the subsidy that have developmental or distributive justice goals are more intractable. The results of the study have implications for carbon emission reduction strategies in developing states with fossil fuel reserves. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Simple method for identifying interdependencies in service delivery in critical infrastructure networks,"Critical infrastructure failures from natural hazard events affect the economic and social well-being of communities. This is particularly true in lower income countries, where infrastructure may be less resistant to natural hazards and disaster recovery is often limited by available resources. The interconnectivity of these systems can strongly affect the services they deliver, and the failure of one infrastructure system can result in cascade failures with wide-reaching consequences. Unfortunately, interconnectivity has been particularly difficult to measure. We present a method for identifying service-oriented interdependencies in interconnected networks. The approach uses well-established methods for network analysis and is demonstrated for healthcare services in the Commonwealth of Dominica, a small island state in the Caribbean. We show that critical links in road networks necessary for healthcare service delivery are important for more than just patient access to a facility, but also on the supply chains that enable the hospitals to function (e.g., water, fuel, medicine). Once identified, the critical links can be overlaid with known hazard vulnerabilities to identify the infrastructure segments of highest priority, based on the risk and consequences of failure. An advantage of the approach presented is that it requires relatively little input data when compared to many network prioritization models and can be run using open-source geospatial data such as OpenStreetMap. The method can be expanded beyond road networks to assess the service-oriented criticality of any infrastructure network. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Groundwater recharge algorithm for forest management models,"Multifunctionality is a critical objective in forest management planning. Water related ecosystem services are only sparsely implemented in Forest Management Models (FMM) although water scarcity is highly relevant. This study proposes an approach to integrate groundwater recharge into a FMM. The approach is based on knowledge transfer between two different forest growth models. For site-specific simulations on the landscape level, observation-based models require functions that describe groundwater recharge in a non-mechanistic way. However, groundwater recharge is difficult to measure and strongly depends on environmental conditions. Thus, we calibrated the observation-based FMM site-specific for two different case study areas, using a process-based forest growth model and substitute empiricism. Relations between forest structure and groundwater recharge were derived with multiple linear regressions and included in a FMM. The groundwater recharge was remarkably influenced by tree species and stand structure at both sites. The approach simulates groundwater recharge plausibly depending on site conditions and stand management on landscape level. Groundwater recharge was between 30–50% of the occurring precipitation and higher within broadleaved stands. Exemplary simulation of a European beech - Norway spruce mixed forest stand reveals a trade-off between groundwater recharge and stand volume growth depending on forest management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
An eco-social policy typology: From system reproduction to transformation,"Eco-social policy research has emerged to address the interconnected and escalating pressures of social reproduction, climate change, and biodiversity loss, which require structural and behavioural changes for environmental and social welfare. However, conceptual ambiguity persists in applying an eco-social policy perspective to empirical research. After reviewing the interconnections and tensions of environmental and social policy, this article proposes a novel eco-social policy typology to assess policy discourses for their eco-social potential and to imagine different pathways towards sustainable policy-integration. The typology discusses four perspectives: Green Economy, Green Keynesianism, Recomposing Consumption and Production, and Degrowth. Each perspective is analysed based on its approach towards economic growth, the extent to which it appreciates public modes of governance, and its potential to either perpetuate existing institutionalised policymaking frameworks or lead to transformative shifts. This typology fosters constructive debates on integrating environmental and social policy, facilitates empirical research on policy proposals’ eco-social potential and offers guidance in evaluating policy discourses through an eco-social lens. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Get Even and Feel Good? Moderating Effects of Justice Sensitivity and Counterproductive Work Behavior on the Relationship Between Illegitimate Tasks and Self-Esteem,"We proposed that effects of illegitimate tasks, which comprise unreasonable and unnecessary tasks, on self-esteem and counterproductive work behavior (CWB) are enhanced among employees who are highly sensitive to injustice. CWB was further proposed to be a moderating coping strategy, which restores justice and buffers the detrimental effects of illegitimate tasks on self-esteem. In this study, 241 employees participated in a diary study over five workdays and a follow-up questionnaire one week later. Daily effects were determined in multilevel analyses: Unreasonable tasks decreased self-esteem and increased CWB the same day, especially among employees high in trait justice sensitivity. Unnecessary tasks only related to more CWB the same day, regardless of one's justice sensitivity. Weekly effects were determined in cross-lagged panel analyses: Unreasonable and unnecessary tasks increased CWB, and justice sensitivity moderated the effect of unreasonable tasks on CWB and of unnecessary tasks on self-esteem. Moderating effects of CWB were split: In daily analyses, CWB buffered the negative effects of illegitimate tasks. In weekly analyses, CWB enhanced the negative effects of illegitimate tasks. Overall, illegitimate tasks rather affected CWB than self-esteem, with more consistent effects for unreasonable than for unnecessary tasks. Thus, we confirm illegitimate tasks as a relevant work stressor with issues of injustice being central to this concept and personality having an influence on what is perceived as (il)legitimate. © 2018 American Psychological Association.",Not About Sufficiency

Evidence from well-dated archaeological human skeletons and mummified remains speaks directly to patterns of human health over time through changing circumstances. Here, we describe variation in human epidemiological patterns in the context of past rapid climate change (RCC) events and other periods of past environmental change. Case studies confirm that human communities responded to environmental changes in diverse ways depending on historical, sociocultural, and biological contingencies. Certain factors, such as social inequality and disproportionate access to resources in large, complex societies may influence the probability of major sociopolitical disruptions and reorganizations-commonly known as ""collapse.""This survey of Holocene human-environmental relations demonstrates how flexibility, variation, and maintenance of Indigenous knowledge can be mitigating factors in the face of environmental challenges. Although contemporary climate change is more rapid and of greater magnitude than the RCC events and other environmental changes we discuss here, these lessons from the past provide clarity about potential priorities for equitable, sustainable development and the constraints of modernity we must address.

Water is a human right! grassroots resistance to corporate power,"In this short piece, I seek to explore two main questions: 1) How can communities take control over local governance and shape local economic futures? and 2) How can local communities effectively band together to support world-system transformation? I examine examples of transnational organizing around water and, specifically, the National Summit on the Human Right to Water held in Abuja, Nigeria in January 2019. A repeated theme at the Summit was the idea that privatization is a threat because the narrative of the profit-based solution of privatization is at odds with the idea that people—and their human right to basic needs like water—come before profit. Privatization is a threat to human rights everywhere, and as climate change progresses resources will become even more scarce, with more of a push from corporations seeking to control and commodify water. One of the most powerful short-term results of this summit, therefore, was how it served as a space for global solidarity building around the human right to water. © 2019, University Library System, University of Pittsburgh.

A Kaleckian wealth tax to support a Green New Deal,"Green New Deals are being widely discussed as both a means to confront climate change and to improve aspects of social well-being. An important facet of the discussion is how they should be financed. The negative impacts of Covid-19 on national budgets and sovereign debt question whether the implementation of Green New Deals is feasible if austerity needs to be introduced to achieve sustainability. This article assesses whether a wealth tax based upon the work of Michal Kalecki could help avoid austerity measures and facilitate the introduction of Green New Deals. While wealth taxes have traditionally been defined on net worth or assets to reduce wealth inequality, the formulation is meant to be equitable by applying to gross wealth or assets. Estimates are calculated for the United States and turn out to be quite modest. The approach not only generates revenue to cover expected net interest outlays on national debt, but additional revenue to pay down portions of it and/or support green initiatives, such as Biden’s de-carbonisation policy. The article concludes with a discussion of challenges for the tax’s effectiveness. JEL Codes: H2, H3, B2, B3. © The Author(s) 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
The left and gender relations -- criticism and self criticism -- what is the way forward?,"This essay of the month discusses some of the lessons to be learned from the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and applied to the new opportunities in South Africa to undue patriarchal systems and transform gender relations. In South Africa socialism and equitable gender relations will be manifested in the care with which the Reconstruction and Development Program is implemented in gender sensitive ways. Economic transformations for women are of great importance, but so are political empowerment, state policy, and addressing social problems. Socialists must be aware of class relations and within that context gender relations. National liberation struggles offer a sense of direction in the integration of gender relations into development. Nicaraguan women have established Houses of Women, which provide legal, health, maternity, and day care services as a means of engaging women in a mass-driven approach. In Costa Rica the Vanguard Party recognizes the obstacles to the political engagement of women as husbands' attitudes, child care, and household responsibilities. Perestroika contributes new ideas about the social problems of family life. Gorbachev's address to the 27th Congress provides suggestions about shortening women's work day and granting paid maternity leave of 18 months. Paid sick leave for care of sick children would be increased for women. Special allowances would be given to low income families with children aged under 12 years of age. Preschool education would be expanded. In South Africa some of these proposals could be applied for men and women in the course of job creation while supporting within the political process the familial and social responsibility of men. Thus South Africa can avoid the problems of men loafing rather than helping relieve their wives of some of the burdensome tasks of infant care. Socialism in South Africa must specifically address the damage from apartheid, which particularly scarred youth and children. Community Life Centers should be established for psychological and social work counseling. Crime, violence, and social dislocation can be solved through addressing the personal in a political and organizational manner by political party policies, nongovernmental organizations, and government activities. Attention to socioeconomic issues and democratizing structures does not go far enough.",Not About Sufficiency

Application of soil survey in land use planning and policy development,"Soils have a crucial role in addressing some of the key issues of our time, such as food security and climate change, and provide a key natural resource asset underpinning sustainable development. Until now, this role has largely been ignored in the policy debate. This situation is changing internationally, as the importance of the land in supporting our future survival and prosperity is increasingly realised. A soil management strategy providing a clear purpose and direction for policy development and a framework to coordinate activities is essential. A policy vision and a set of guiding principles to meet this challenge are proposed, and the value of good underpinning soil resource information is demonstrated. The soil survey of the Abu Dhabi Emirate, which delivers a soil and land resource dataset at a scale, accuracy and consistency required to support land use planning and policy development, is a signi fi cant achievement that should be applauded. The opportunities provided by this new comprehensive information to achieve sustainable development in the Abu Dhabi Emirate are immense. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.",Not About Sufficiency
A phylogenetic re-analysis of groupers with applications for ciguatera fish poisoning,"Background: Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is a significant public health problem due to dinoflagellates. It is responsible for one of the highest reported incidence of seafood-borne illness and Groupers are commonly reported as a source of CFP due to their position in the food chain. With the role of recent climate change on harmful algal blooms, CFP cases might become more frequent and more geographically widespread. Since there is no appropriate treatment for CFP, the most efficient solution is to regulate fish consumption. Such a strategy can only work if the fish sold are correctly identified, and it has been repeatedly shown that misidentifications and species substitutions occur in fish markets. Methods: We provide here both a DNA-barcoding reference for groupers, and a new phylogenetic reconstruction based on five genes and a comprehensive taxonomical sampling. We analyse the correlation between geographic range of species and their susceptibility to ciguatera accumulation, and the co-occurrence of ciguatoxins in closely related species, using both character mapping and statistical methods. Results: Misidentifications were encountered in public databases, precluding accurate species identifications. Epinephelinae now includes only twelve genera (vs. 15 previously). Comparisons with the ciguatera incidences show that in some genera most species are ciguateric, but statistical tests display only a moderate correlation with the phylogeny. Atlantic species were rarely contaminated, with ciguatera occurrences being restricted to the South Pacific. Conclusions: The recent changes in classification based on the reanalyses of the relationships within Epinephelidae have an impact on the interpretation of the ciguatera distribution in the genera. In this context and to improve the monitoring of fish trade and safety, we need to obtain extensive data on contamination at the species level. Accurate species identifications through DNA barcoding are thus an essential tool in controlling CFP since meal remnants in CFP cases can be easily identified with molecular tools. © 2014 Schoelinck et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Modification of Housing Mobility Experimental Effects on Delinquency and Educational Problems: Middle Adolescence as a Sensitive Period,"Residential mobility is one documented stressor contributing to higher delinquency and worse educational outcomes. Sensitive period life course models suggest that certain developmental stages make individuals more susceptible to the effects of an exposure, like residential mobility, on outcomes. However, most prior research is observational, and has not examined heterogeneity across age or gender that may inform sensitive periods, even though it may have important implications for the etiology of adolescent development. Moreover, there are important translational implications for identifying the groups most vulnerable to residential mobility to inform how to buffer adverse effects of moving. In this study, low-income families were randomized to residential mobility out of public housing into lower poverty neighborhoods using a rental subsidy voucher (“experimental voucher condition”), and were compared to control families remaining in public housing. The sample was comprised of 2829 youth (51% female; 62% Non-Hispanic Black, 31% Hispanic, 7% other race). At baseline, youth ranged from 5 to 16 years old. This study hypothesized that random assignment to the housing voucher condition would generate harmful effects on delinquency and educational problems, compared to the control group, among boys who were older at baseline. The results confirmed this hypothesis: random assignment to the experimental voucher condition generating residential mobility caused higher delinquency among boys who were 13–16 years old at baseline, compared to same-age, in-place public housing controls. However, residential mobility did not affect delinquency among girls regardless of age, or among boys who were 5–12 years old at baseline. The pattern of results for educational problems was similar but weaker. Families with teenage boys are particularly vulnerable to residential transitions. Incorporating additional supports into housing programs may help low-income, urban families to successfully transition to lower poverty neighborhoods. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency

The bio-economy concept and knowledge base in a public goods and farmer perspective,"Currently an industrial perspective dominates the EU policy framework for a European bio-economy. The Commission’s proposal on the bio-economy emphasises greater resource-efficiency, largely within an industrial perspective on global economic competitiveness, benefiting capital-intensive industries at higher levels of the value chain. However a responsible bio-economy must initially address the sustainable use of resources. Many farmers are not only commodity producers but also providers of quality food and managers of the eco-system. A public goods-oriented bio-economy emphasises agro-ecological methods, organic and low (external) input farming systems, ecosystem services, social innovation in multi-stakeholder collective practices and joint production of knowledge. The potential of farmers and SMEs to contribute to innovation must be fully recognised. This approach recognises the importance of local knowledge enhancing local capabilities, while also accommodating diversity and complexity. Therefore the bio-economy concept should have a much broader scope than the dominant one in European Commission innovation policy. Socio-economic research is needed to inform strategies, pathways and stakeholder cooperation towards sustainability goals. © Firenze University Press.",Not About Sufficiency
Alien species and human health: Austrian stakeholder perspective on challenges and solutions,"No saturation in the introduction, acceleration of spread and the increasing impacts of alien species are a characteristic feature of the Anthropocene. Concomitantly, alien species affecting human health are supposed to increase, mainly due to increasing global trade and climate change. In this study, we assess challenges and solutions posed by such species to the public health sector in Austria over the next few decades. We did so using an online questionnaire circulated to 131 experts and stakeholders working on human health and biological invasions, supplemented by in-depth interviews with eleven selected experts. Results from the online survey and in-depth interviews largely support and complement each other. Experts and stakeholders suggest that (i) the allergenic Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed), the photodermatoxic Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed), and vectors of diseases such as Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito) are considered the alien species posing the most severe challenges; (ii) challenges are expected to increase in the next few decades and awareness in the public health sector is not sufficient; (iii) effective and efficient solutions are mainly related to prevention. Specific solutions include pathway management of introduction and spread by monitoring and controlling established populations of ragweed, hogweed and mosquitos. © 2018, MDPI AG.

"Harry Stobbs Memorial Lecture, 1997 Rethinking high input systems of livestock production: A case study of nitrogen emissions in Dutch dairy farming","Livestock are essential in many farming systems where they provide income, food and power, or where they enhance soil fertility or the socioeconomic situation of farmers. However, livestock can also cause environmental degradation, pollution and social inequality. The contradiction between these views lies in differences between production systems, here called modes of agriculture. This paper starts, therefore, by giving a classification of livestock systems as a framework to rethink the role of livestock in high-input agriculture. The classification explains what is meant by high-input systems by placing them in a sequence of modes in agriculture that each face sustainability problems in different ways. Secondly, the paper discusses negative effects of livestock in high-input systems by zooming in on nitrogen surpluses in dairy farming of the Netherlands. It then elaborates ways to cope with these problems by distinguishing between linear and dynamic aspects. Linear aspects refer to reductionist approaches like other methods of feeding, housing and/or manure application. Dynamic aspects refer to holistic approaches which acknowledge that an intervention in one part of the system affects the functioning of the system elsewhere. Examples of practical and administrative measures regarding the rethinking of high-input systems are elaborated.",Not About Sufficiency
Potential and limits of land and soil for sustainable intensification of European agriculture,"Population and consumption growth causes a 50% greater demand for food and fiber in the next 35 years. This causes increasing pressure on agricultural production often accompanied by an increasingly degraded environment. To overcome this problem, the concept of “sustainable intensification” (SI) was introduced. The concept recognizes the need to simultaneously increase agricultural productivity and further reduce negative environmental impacts. So far, the importance of soil and its natural resilience was not included into the studies of SI. The aim of this study was to identify and localize arable soils with a high potential of recovery after disturbances (i.e. resilience) in Europe. Therefore, in a first step we attributed the new LUCAS 2009 topsoil data from 25 EU member states to the arable land in the Corine Land Use Cover 2006 data set as well as to the European digital soil map (ESDB). This resulted in the identification of 671,672 km2, approximately two-thirds of the total arable land in Europe. In a second step, a recently established classification scheme based on 6 intrinsic soil and land indicators (i.e. soil pH, contents of soil organic carbon and clay plus silt, cation exchange capacity, soil depth, slope) was applied to the arable land. These six measured soil indicators try to comprise the main biochemical and physical soil properties influencing soil resilience. The results show that from a soil perspective, almost half (44%) of the investigated arable land cannot be recommended for SI. More than 3% of this area should be de- intensified in order to reduce environmental harm. 16% of the arable land can be recommended for SI with restrictions, whereas 40% of arable land has the potential for SI without impacting the delivery of goods and services provided by soils. The application of the presented classification scheme on a local study area (1.56 km2) in Central Europe revealed clearly that for any final decisions on SI it is important to consider the heterogeneity of soil at the local scale. Our results of this and a previous study demonstrate that the presented classification scheme can be used on different scales including the local, regional and continental scale. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Urban open and green spaces: is Malta planning and designing them to increase resilience,"2030 has been set as the target for achieving most of the sustainable development goals and in this path urban open and green spaces have been identified as drivers and accelerators for increasing resilience and adapting cities to climate change. The pandemic has acted as a further catalyst for the reorganization and re-assessment of the role of open spaces. This work focuses on the system of urban open and green spaces whose planning and design, through a systemic approach, can address the current and future urban challenges such as climate change. The main aim of the paper is to define the key elements for the planning and design of urban and open green spaces, starting from the EU referring framework and the case study of Malta. The outputs can support the local decision-makers in increasing the sustainability and resilience of urban areas by improving the provision of these physical elements. Findings suggest that EU and international strategies advocate urban open and green spaces as an indisputable requirement for increasing resilience, energy sustainability and adaptive capacity of urban systems. However, in comparison, there is still scope for improvement when considering Malta’s planning framework. While there is a growing sentiment for the appreciation and need for green open spaces from the users, important characteristics are still lacking within planning processes. © 2023, FeDOA - Federico II University Press.

Biological control for One Health,"Biological control has been effectively exploited by mankind since 300 CE. By promoting the natural regulation of pests, weeds, and diseases, it produces societal benefits at the food-environment-health nexus. Here we scrutinize biological control endeavours and their social-ecological outcomes through a holistic ‘One-Health’ lens, recognizing that the health of humans, animals, plants, and the wider environment are linked and interdependent. Evidence shows that biological control generates desirable outcomes within all One Health dimensions, mitigating global change issues such as chemical pollution, biocide resistance, biodiversity loss, and habitat destruction. Yet, its cross-disciplinary achievements remain underappreciated. To remedy this, we advocate a systems-level, integrated approach to biological control research, policy, and practice. Framing biological control in a One Health context helps to unite medical and veterinary personnel, ecologists, conservationists and agricultural professionals in a joint quest for solutions to some of the most pressing issues in planetary health. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
FOREST FIRES AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE IN CHILE: THE CASE OF THE BIOBÍO REGION,"Forest fires generate a series of negative consequences for people’s health and represent a growing threat to public health, with their increasing frequency and intensity due to climate change. In this sense, the case of central Chile is particularly interesting as it has a temperate climate characterized by hot and dry summers and has a high vulnerability to climate change. This paper assesses the association between the occurrence of forest fires and the number of emergency room visits for respiratory symptoms in primary care centres in the Biobío region. We focus on the Biobío region because it has been the most affected region in the last 30 years. An empirical study was carried out using data on forest fires provided by the National Forestry Corporation (CONAF), meteorological information on temperature and precipitation obtained from the Meteorological Directorate of Chile, and respiratory emergency data provided by the Ministry of Health for the period between 2010 and 2020. A regression model using ordinary least squares was developed to determine the effect of a forest fire on the number of admissions to emergency care visits for respiratory symptoms to public health centres, and we use meteorological control variables. The results were statistically significant and indicate that, on average, there was a 33% increase in the number of cases for respiratory symptoms in health centres located in areas exposed to forest fires. These results may be useful for the implementation of public health policies. © 2024 WIT Press.",Not About Sufficiency
Digital Health Innovations: Advancing Climate–Health–Sustainability Synergies,"Digital health innovations are pivotal in addressing climate change, public health, and sustainability challenges. These technologies can significantly improve global health and promote environmental sustainability when combined with climate-conscious methods. This chapter delves into how digital health aids climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Tools like mobile apps, wearables, and telemedicine reduce carbon emissions by limiting in-person visits. Access to digital health information becomes catalytic in healthcare delivery. Emphasizing the impact of climate change on health, climate literacy, disease tracking, and early warning systems are well-informed with the help of digital tools. Telehealth and digital education provide underserved communities essential health access (Brown et al., Journal of Global Health Equity 5:34–46, 2022; Katz et al., Journal of Environmental Health Sciences 14:201–216, 2023). While ICT usage in health information has grown, accuracy remains crucial, given misinformation risks. ICT has, however, reshaped healthcare delivery (Hesse et al., Archives of Internal Medicine 165:2618, 2005; Wadhwa, ICT interventions for improved health service quality and delivery in India: A literature review, 2019). Merging digital health and sustainability can reduce healthcare’s environmental footprint (Barrett et al., Journal of Sustainable Development 6:112–125, 2019) and drive sustainable behaviors through gamification (Boulos et al., Games for Health Journal 9:301–315, 2020).

Winners and losers of energy sustainability—Global assessment of the Sustainable Development Goals,"Energy sustainability plays a crucial role in achieving environmental sustainability, hence, underpins climate change mitigation. Yet, studies assessing the overarching effect of existing sustainability frameworks on energy production and consumption are limited. Here, we provide comprehensive assessment of energy sustainability across 217 countries and territories spanning 1960–2019. Using 11 targets and 15 indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we present winners and losers of energy sustainability by accounting for pre-millennium development goals (MDGs), MDGs, and SDGs across income groups. While the inception of the 2030 agenda has improved energy and environmental performance across economies, low-income countries are still struggling to meet several of the SDGs. We find that sustained economic growth with reduced income inequality improves energy sustainability in developing economies. However, sustainable climate policies that reduce trade-offs between energy resources and environmental threats are highly recommended in climate-prone regions that depend heavily on water resources to boost power generation capacity. © 2022 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Yield and quality of potato tuber and its water productivity are influenced by alternate furrow irrigation in a raised bed system,"Scarcity of irrigation water has now become the main constraint for crop production globally. Irrigation water scarcity becomes severe especially during the dry, winter season in South Asia, particularly in Bangladesh due to the decline in groundwater table and drying of surface water resources. In South Asian countries, potato is traditionally grown with furrow irrigation system in dry, winter season in which irrigation water is applied frequently to each and every furrow. Such irrigation method increases water use and lowers irrigation water productivity (WP). We hypothesized that potatoes grown on raised beds, and irrigation water applied to alternate furrows based on the principle of partial root-zone drying, would maintain yield, reduce water use and increase WP, and enhance the quality of potato tubers in drought-prone areas of South Asia. To test this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted in two consecutive dry, winter seasons (2015–16 and 2016–17) at the research field of Irrigation and Water Management Division of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute, Gazipur, Central Bangladesh and assessed crop dry matter and yields, water use and WP, quality, and nutrient concentrations of potato tubers in different irrigation treatments. The experiment consisted of two levels (first, three irrigation at critical growth stages and second, four irrigation at every 12–15 days interval) and three methods (AFI – alternate furrow irrigation; FFI - fixed furrow irrigation; and EFI – every furrow irrigation) of irrigation. Dry matter and tuber yield of potato did not differ significantly (P < 0.05) between AFI and EFI but differed significantly (P < 0.01) when compared to FFI. On average, AFI and EFI had tuber yield of 21.9 and 22.2 t ha−1 with three irrigation and 23.2 t ha−1 and 23.9 t ha−1 with four irrigation, respectively during 2016 and 2017 while AFI and EFI had WP of 14.8 kg m-3 and 9.89 kg m-3 with three irrigation and 14.9 kg m-3 and 9.96 kg m-3 with four irrigation, respectively during 2016 and 2017. On average, AFI saved irrigation water by 35% and irrigation water productivity significantly (P < 0.001) improved by 50% compared to EFI over two years. Total soluble sugar, as an indicator of tuber quality, also varied significantly (P < 0.01) between AFI (6.290 Brix) and EFI (6.370 Brix). Nutrient concentrations of potato tubers were not significantly different (P < 0.05) between irrigation treatments. Results demonstrate that the alternate furrow irrigation can maintain potato tuber yield, and reduce water use and increase irrigation water productivity of potato tubers compared to every or fixed furrow irrigation in Bangladesh. This irrigation method could potentially be an attractive alternative to every or fixed furrow irrigation in South Asian countries where irrigation water is limited and appropriate water-saving irrigation methods are not available. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Identification of heat tolerant lentil genotypes through stress tolerance indices,"With climate change projections indicating an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events and irregular rainfall patterns globally, the threat to global food security looms large. Terminal heat stress, which occurs during the critical reproductive stage, significantly limits lentil productivity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve lentil’s resilience to heat stress to sustain production. However, studies identifying heat-tolerant sources in lentils are limited. To address these issues, we assessed 158 lentil genotypes under normal and late-sown conditions over two consecutive seasons. We employed eleven heat stress indices to identify lines tolerant to heat stress. All genotypes exhibited a decrease in average grain yield when subjected to stress conditions as compared to non-stress conditions, indicating the impact of heat stress on crop yield. Correlation analysis showed significant positive correlation between yield in normal and late-sown conditions and the following heat stress indices: STI, MP, MRP, YI, GMP, and HM. In contrast, TOL, SSPI, and PYR showed negative associations with yield in late-sown conditions. Based on these indices, we identified the genotypes P13143, P13130, and P13135 as high-yielding in both stress and non-stress conditions. Cluster analysis and biplot display in PCA also confirmed that genotypes P13143, P13130, and P13135 exhibited suitability and high yield potential in both environments. These genotypes can be utilized as donors in future breeding programs to introduce genetic variations for improving heat stress tolerance in lentil. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating multiple stressors in aquaculture to build the blue growth in a changing sea,"Fisheries currently represent the main source of animal protein intake worldwide, although catches of most commercial species are at or beyond maximum sustainable yields. Increasing production would require an excess of exploitation levels and aquaculture is expected to become crucial in sustaining a growing seafood demand. Nonetheless, many threats are expected to affect aquaculture and the increased production must evolve in a way that minimizes environmental and socio-economic impacts. The claimed sustainable development of human activities at sea (blue growth and economy) seeks for new joint analyses and solutions at (trans-)national systemic level should be planned and applied. To meet a sustainable development, both production and management approaches should evolve. Here we propose a conceptual framework to integrate a “downscaling approach” based on functional features of cultivated organisms to accommodate multiple stressors in setting sustainable development standards to design adaptive solutions fitting with the management of marine space. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"Assessing land, nutrients and monetary value associated with postharvest loss of persimmon in Brazil: pathways toward sustainability in agri-food systems","Purpose: This study estimates the land footprint, nutrients and monetary value of persimmon loss in Brazil, and also consolidated the methodological approach for assessing resources related to food loss. Design/methodology/approach: It uses data on the harvested area, production, production loss and production value of persimmon in Brazil from 2014 to 2019. The persimmon loss in Brazil was converted into macro- and micronutrients, land use and monetary value. Findings: The average annual production loss, loss production value and land footprint of persimmon are 35,100 tons, US$12m and 1,673 hectares, respectively. Persimmon loss represents the average loss per year of 6.6bn grams of carbohydrates, 1.6bn grams of food fibers, 7.2bn milligrams of vitamin C, 41.8bn micrograms of vitamin A, 4.5bn milligrams of calcium and 54.8bn milligrams of potassium. These nutrients have the potential to meet the nutritional daily needs of approximately 135,000, 176,000 people, 270,000, 164,000, 12,000 and 32m, respectively. Practical implications: Through (1) research and innovation; (2) infrastructure development; (3) training and education; (4) collaboration and networking; and (5) market diversification and value addition, people can increase persimmon shelf life, reduce postharvest losses and create a resilient environment for small persimmon farmers. This approach promotes sustainability in the agri-food system and empowers stakeholders.

Impact of soil water regimes and partial root-zone drying in field-grown papaya in semi-arid conditions,"This study aimed to evaluate in the papaya Tainung genotype, the effects of partial root-zone drying (PRD) technique on soil water regimes by using different frequencies of shifting irrigation-side of plant row and the effects of PRD technique on (1) crop agronomic performance, (2) titratable fruit acidity (TA), (3) total soluble solids (TSS), and TSS/TA ratio. Also, we analyze the spatial dynamic of papaya condition using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from different satellite images. The study was conducted in the semi-arid region of Bahia (BA) and Minas Gerais (MG), Brazil. The combination of 100% (Full irrigation—FU), 50%, and 35% in the irrigation depth (WID) and frequencies of shifting plant-row side irrigation of 0 (Fixed Irrigation—FX), 7, 14, and 21 days were applied. Nine treatments were studied in BA and five in MG. The water available in the soil was reduced to 44% for frequencies of shifting plant-row side irrigation of 7 days, 50% for 14 days, and 85% for 21 days, compared to the soil water availability at field capacity. Partial water deficit in the soil through the PRD technique did not significantly reduce the total root length, effective root depth, and root effective horizontal distance of the papaya Tainung genotype. However, PRD treatments showed leaf abscission, which resulted in reduced leaf area and NDVI values, especially in the MG experiment. Papaya yield and fruit quality were not affected. However, except for PRD 21 35%, irrigation water depth reduced to 50 and 35% under PRD increased crop water productivity (CWP) in papaya plants. Thus, the PRD technique may save 35% of WID using the alternation of lateral shift irrigation of crop row every 7 days under water scarcity in semi-arid regions. The NDVI index was important to compare the papaya canopy vigor between the experimental areas studied. We also confirmed the potential of NDVI to monitor the vigor of papaya canopy, since we could notice the sensibility of NDVI to identify water stress in papaya in higher vapor pressure deficit (VPD) conditions occurred in October 2016 and January 2017 in Bom Jesus da Lapa-BA. Therefore, the PRD strategy can be a useful tool to save water in papaya cultivation under semi-arid conditions. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Nature-based solutions (NBS) for sustainable development of the resource base and ecosystem services of marine and coastal ecosystems of India,"The imminent dangers due to increasing anthropogenic stress on the coastal seas, as well as marine pollution in the Anthropocene, have highlighted the need to devise and adopt novel eco-sustainable solutions through the use of technology for India. Special emphasis on the use of scientifically derived marine fishery advisories (MFAs) can have multiple co-benefits with the utilization of nature-based solutions (NbS) for monitoring and management of coastal and marine resource bases. Such co-management options can be effective to realize the targets for Sustainable Development Goals 14 (SDG 14) for 2030. At present, the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) provides the MFAs on a daily basis by using a combination of data from satellite imageries and ground-based datasets. However, sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems services needs to be informed by appropriate technological models of resources usage, including the incorporation of coastal zone management plans as per NbS frameworks for achieving long-term successes. The present study highlights the need to adopt NbS and MFAs as co-management approaches for adaptation and/or mitigation of the impacts of climatic and environmental factors as well as for fostering sustainable fishing initiatives for the Bay of Bengal. Such integrative methodologies are crucial for the development of model-based policy frameworks for sustainable marine resources management. Accordingly, an assessment of the NbS techniques for deriving a new adaptive framework is presented and discussed in the context of consideration of MFAs as NbS Assisting Technologies (NAT) to obtain significant co-benefits for sustainable development. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",Not About Sufficiency

Over the years, water policies in Ontario have come under public and academic scrutiny for being insufficient in addressing competing water demands of different sectors, incentivizing sustainable use as well as proactively signaling water risks at the sub-watershed scale. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Environmental control of germination in semi-arid Mediterranean systems: The case of annuals on gypsum soils,"Whether or not it is time for germination is a dilemma for annuals since they have only a single opportunity to reproduce successfully. This is critical for species living in stressful and unpredictable environments such as Mediterranean habitats. In order to clarify the environmental cues of germination, four annuals of different families, all of them occurring very frequently on gypsum soils, were selected and their germination observed under 14 climate scenarios, mimicking temperature and photoperiod conditions from autumn to spring, at two levels of water availability (continuous irrigation versus an initial single irrigation event followed by a progressive soil desiccation). In spring scenarios, two seed-storage conditions were compared: dry cold and room conditions. In the absence of water limitation, germination decreased from early autumn to late spring. Water scarcity always reduced germination, especially in early spring. Our results suggest a facultative winter germination behaviour and highlight the crucial role of dry cold storage in reducing spring germination. In conclusion, Mediterranean ephemerals showed a very plastic germination response that allows them to take advantage of favourable environmental conditions from autumn to spring. This environmental cueing is combined with the ability to dilute the risk through a variable rate of seed dormancy that, according to bet-hedging strategies, increases from secure autumn to riskier spring. © 2014 Cambridge University Press.",Not About Sufficiency
Urban resilience at eye level: Spatial analysis of empirically defined experiential landscapes,"An unresolved issue in creating resilient cities is how to obtain sustainability benefits from densification while not eroding the capacity of social-ecological systems to generate wellbeing for urban dwellers. To understand how different relationships between urban form and wellbeing together play out, we analysed geocoded experiential data (1460 experiences from 780 respondents) together with variables of the physical environment. Through statistical and spatial analysis, we operationalised resilience principles to assess what urban environments provide “resilience at eye level” – a diversity of experiences and a level of connectivity between them that limit adverse outcomes. We found 8 typologies of experiential landscapes – distinct compositions of 11 categories of experiences. Our analysis shows that typologies with experiences supportive of wellbeing are diverse and exist in environments that balance residents and workplaces, avoid extreme spatial integration and/or density and have accessible nature. Typologies with many experiences hindering wellbeing fail in one or several of these respects. Our findings suggest that resilience principles can act as a guiding heuristic for urban densification that does not compromise human wellbeing. © 2019 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
A 'laboratory' of landscape degradation: Social and economic implications for sustainable development in peri-urban areas,"The present paper debates on human-derived landscape degradation (LD) and sustainable development reviewing the main factors of soil and land degradation in northern Mediterranean peri-urban areas, taken as paradigmatic cases for Europe and the Mediterranean basin. Population growth and urban sprawl were found as the most important factors determining soil sealing, land consumption, biodiversity decline and loss in natural resources. The multifaceted interactions observed between socioeconomic and biophysical factors were also highlighted. The study discusses an integrated set of measures as a policy instrument for sustainable land management of Mediterranean peri-urban areas.

First Nations Perspectives on Sea Otter Conservation in British Columbia and Alaska: Insights into Coupled Human-Ocean Systems,"Highly valued, hunted, managed, and traded by indigenous people for at least 12,000 years, sea otters share a deep history of interactions with humans along North America's northwest coast. Yet the nineteenth century extirpation and subsequent recovery of sea otters triggered profound ecological, cultural, and socio-economic transformations that continue to elicit complex trade-offs that coastal communities grapple with today. To expand our understanding of past baselines, future recovery targets, and the role First Nations in British Columbia and Alaska once played in altering and managing coastal resources, including sea otters, we synthesized evidence from archeological faunal remains, historical records, traditional knowledge, and contemporary ecological research. Archeological evidence suggests that sea otter hunting was a significant and widespread practice among aboriginal people in this area throughout the Holocene, although the magnitude of use varied spatially. Furthermore, isotopic evidence suggests that over the millennia, sea otters may have been reduced in numbers, existing below carrying capacity, and excluded near human settlements. Furthermore, traditional knowledge and historical records reveal that indigenous peoples of the northwest coast developed diverse technologies to conserve and manage coastal marine resources, such as selective harvesting, seasonal restrictions on use or consumption, and proprietorship that was contingent on sustained productivity. Ancient marine tenure systems and governance protocols based on reciprocity were used to conserve and spatially manage most marine species, including sea otters. Current First Nations perspectives on sea otter conservation and management vary among people and through time as sea otter population status changes, as communities adapt to this perturbation, and as new legal frameworks supporting First Nations rights to co-management emerge. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Climate change effects on irrigated agriculture: Perspectives from agricultural producers in eastern Uzbekistan,"Sustainability of irrigated agricultural development has been severely impacted by global climate change in recent decades, which is among the main environmental and economic problems facing the world community. The article presents the results of the research conducted in selected areas of irrigated agriculture in eastern Uzbekistan to study the impact of climate change on agricultural production and the agricultural producer's perspective and awareness. Major factors affecting agricultural producers' behavior under climate change and their current practices and skills for adapting to climate change were studied. The field study has been conducted in 9 districts located in two regions of the Ferghana valley. The respondents-representatives of agricultural producers selected from the list of Farmer's Associations members taking their location relative to irrigation water sources into account. Quantitative analysis of data carried out with the use of SPSS-22 software. As the research results show, the impact of climate change on irrigated agriculture has become incredibly tangible in the last decade. It affected the situation with losses in yields of up to 16% and decreasing the quality of agricultural products. The rural population's vulnerability factors include low income from agriculture, acute dependence on irrigation in conditions of increasing water scarcity, low level of applied technologies, adaptation measures, low yields, land degradation, etc. Analysis of the research results, and other related studies on this issue, allows us to indicate directions for improving adaptation measures in the short, medium, and long-term periods. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Worldwide research trends on land tenure,"Land tenure issues can contribute to food insecurity, limited livelihood opportunities and consequently poverty. Lack of land tenure can cause migratory movements that can affect not only individuals and families but also communities or even entire nations. This study aims to underline the scientific and social relevance of land tenure studies by identifying research focus and trends. To this end, we analyzed all scientific publications related to land tenure from 1950 to 2020. The three most active countries in this field are the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. The three most active countries in this field are the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, with the three main institutions being Wageningen University & Research, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Three different research periods have been identified in this domain. In the period from 1950 to 1999, the main research clusters identified were related to socioeconomics and demography issues. In the second period, from 2000 to 2009, the main research clusters identified were related to specific geographical areas and land rights issues, with an emphasis on countries in Africa or South America. In the third period, from 2010 to 2020, the main research clusters identified were related to environmental aspects. It has been found that land tenure studies have always been linked to what subsequently became the sustainable development goals, especially those related to the elimination of poverty and hunger in the first period, economic growth and reducing inequalities in the second period, and climate change in the third period. From a geographical point of view, the first two periods were characterized by terms related to continents such as Africa, Asia, or Latin America, with Africa being the most frequently used term in the first two periods. In the third period, studies on specific countries stood out, especially those related to China and Mexico. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
How climate change interacts with inequity to affect nutrition,"Climate change poses a growing threat to the achievement of optimal nutritional status, both directly through affecting food production and indirectly through altering social and economic influences in people's lives. These adverse nutrition outcomes are not evenly distributed across the world, and vulnerable populations are the most impacted. Understanding how different forms of inequity interact with climate change and adverse nutritional outcomes is a novel area of research in today's challenging environment of increased climate change pressures. This article presents the results of a systematic literature search undertaken to identify the connections, trends and pathways between climate change, inequity and nutrition outcomes. Forty-six peer-reviewed studies are identified that explore these complex interactions with a specific focus on the extent to which equity is a fundamental component of climate change and nutrition research. The pathways captured in this body of evidence are mapped to current framework thinking to identify trends and gaps. While there is a trend for studies to acknowledge an unfair distribution of vulnerability to adverse nutrition outcomes, there is less attention given to the (lack of) recognition of the social situations which increase these groups' vulnerability and the absence of representation or inclusion of these groups as vital decision-makers. Studies that do incorporate these core dimensions of equity take mixed-method and qualitative approaches. This highlights an inherent value in stepping outside the usual scope of empirical climate change research, one that incorporates the voices of those most affected.

Impacts of Rapid Urban Expansion on Peri-Urban Landscapes in the Global South: Insights from Landscape Metrics in Greater Cairo,"Cities in the Global South are experiencing profound demographic shifts, rapid economic growth, and unchecked urban sprawl, resulting in significant transformations in peri-urban landscapes. This paper focuses on assessing the impacts of chaotic urban expansion in the peri-urban areas (PUAs) of Greater Cairo (GC), serving as a notable case study in the Global South. By analyzing satellite imagery from 2001, 2011, and 2021, this study examines changes in land use/cover (LUC) within GC’s PUAs. Employing five landscape metrics—Landscape Expansion Index (LEI), Percentage of Landscape (PLAND), Fractal Dimension Index (FDI), Mean Patch Size (MPS), and Largest Patch index (LPI)—the research elucidates the adverse effects of unplanned urban expansion in GC’s PUAs. The analysis reveals a substantial loss of over 51 thousand hectares of arable land, raising concerns about food security in the region. Notably, the LEI identifies edge expansion as the predominant urban expansion pattern, while PLAND, FDI, and LPI metrics underscore landscape fragmentation within the peri-urban landscape. These findings have significant implications for authorities and researchers engaged in sustainable development efforts in PUAs. This study lays a crucial foundation for the formulation of successful management strategies to mitigate the adverse consequences of unplanned urban expansion in the PUAs of GC and similar regions worldwide. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Water strategies and water–food Nexus: challenges and opportunities towards sustainable development in various regions of the World,"The twenty-first century is witnessing an explosion in global population, environmental changes, agricultural land disintegration, hunger, and geopolitical instabilities. It is difficult to manage these conditions or standardize improvement systems without thinking of the three main elements or subsystems that are necessary for any meaningful development—namely water (W), energy (E), and food (F). These key elements form what is globally agreed upon as the “WEF Nexus.” While considering them, one should think about the other key factors that influence WEF Nexus, including population’s growth, impacts of environmental changes (including climate change), moderation and adaptation regimes to climate change and climate resilience, loss of biodiversity, and sustainable nature. Together, the WEF Nexus subsystems represent a framework to ensure environmental protection that should be seen as an ethical and socioeconomic obligation. Issues, such as protection of water resources, and strategies and management tools or mechanisms for the use of water assets and agricultural innovations under the obligations of sustainable use, are investigated in this paper. Attention is paid to the relationship between water and food (WF Nexus) or water for food security in various world regions, including the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Central Asia countries and the Caucasus, China, Africa, and Canada. This paper also presents analyses of a great number of up-to-date publications regarding the “Nexus” perspective and its applications and limitations. This paper suggests that the Nexus’ approach, in its different concepts (WEF, WE, WF and EF), can promote sustainable development and improve the quality of life of communities, while preserving natural, human, and social capital, addressing sustainability challenges, and protecting natural resources and the environment for long-term use. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Microplastics: From Intrinsic Properties to Environmental Fate,"The prevalence of microplastics (MPs) in the environment is an escalating global concern, driven by their increasing abundance and potential adverse effects. Their detrimental environmental consequences and risks to public health necessitate urgent action to mitigate their impacts. To better understand MP accumulation within the environment, estimate their impacts, and develop effective mitigation strategies, it is imperative to advance our knowledge of MPs’ environmental fate and how this fate is linked with plastics’ intrinsic properties. We highlight the current research on MPs’ accumulation within different environmental sinks and identify the critical knowledge gaps in understanding the flux of MPs between these sinks. We also discuss how the intrinsic properties of MPs, including polymeric backbone, structure, chemical additives, crystallinity, molecular weight, and hydrophilicity, influence their environmental behavior and degradation pathways. Among these properties, the polymeric backbone and functional groups serve as primary drivers of MP stability when exposed to external physical and chemical factors, thereby influencing the pathway and rate of MP degradation. Other intrinsic properties and environmental conditions mostly impact the rate of MP degradation. As MPs undergo environmental degradation, changes in their intrinsic characteristics can lead to further fragmentation. This process potentially enhances environmental harm due to the resulting particles’ increased surface area, greater environmental mobility, and higher potential for contaminant transport. These factors collectively contribute to the complex dynamics of MPs’ fate and impact on the environment. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Socio-economic and environmental factors influenced the United Nations healthcare sustainable agenda: evidence from a panel of selected Asian and African countries,"The objective of the study is to evaluate socio-economic and environmental factors that influenced the United Nations healthcare sustainable agenda in a panel of 21 Asian and African countries. The results show that changes in price level (0.0062, p < 0.000), life risks of maternal death (4.579, p < 0.000), and under-5 mortality rate (0.374, p < 0.000) substantially increases out-of-pocket health expenditures, while CO2 emissions (5.681, p < 0.003), prevalence of undernourishment (15.184, p < 0.000), PM2.5 particulate emission (1557, p < 0.000), unemployment, and private health expenditures (30.729, p < 0000) are associated with high mortality rate across countries. Healthcare reforms affected by low healthcare spending, unsustainable environment, and ease of environmental regulations that ultimately increases mortality rate across countries. The Granger causality estimates confirmed the different causal mechanisms between socio-economic and environmental factors, which is directly linked with the country’s healthcare agenda, i.e., the causality running from (i) CO2 emissions to life risks of maternal death and under-5 mortality rate, (ii) from depth of food deficit to incidence of tuberculosis and unemployment, (iii) from PM2.5 emissions to infant mortality rate, (iv) from foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to PM2.5 emissions, (v) from trade openness to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and (vi) from mortality indicators to per capita income, while there is a feedback relationship between health expenditures and per capita income across countries. The variance decomposition analysis shows that (i) under-5 mortality rate will increase out-ofpocket health expenditures, (ii) unemployment rate will increase mortality indicators, and (iii) health expenditures will increase economic well-being in a panel of selected countries, for the next 10 years. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019.",Not About Sufficiency
Linking livelihoods and conservation: A conceptual framework and scale for assessing the integration of human needs and biodiversity,"Although there has been increasing interest in trying to link the livelihoods of people living near natural resources to the conservation of those resources, there has been little attempt to systematically assess or measure this linkage. We develop a conceptual framework for defining the linkage between livelihood activities and conservation. We then develop a scale to assess the strength of linkage across five dimensions: species, habitat, spatial, temporal and conservation association. We test the framework and scale by evaluating 39 project sites in the Biodiversity Conservation Network. Finally, we discuss the relevance of linkage to designing appropriate conservation strategies.

Natural resource policies and standard of living in Kazakhstan,"This paper evaluates Kazakhstan's natural resource policies and their impact on the standard of living of the Kazakhstan population within the framework of three determinative factors: globalization and international markets Soviet legacy and 'resource nationalism' and Nursultan Nazarbayev and his authoritarian leadership. It argues that natural resource policies of Kazakhstan failed to improve the living standards of the majority of people in Kazakhstan, especially the poor and those living in oil-producing and rural areas, despite increasing oil prices and revenues. The argument will be supported with an analysis of Kazakhstan's oil wealth distribution in light of global initiatives as well as with evidence derived from official reports and statistical data to find out whether Nazarbayev's widely discussed 'resource nationalism' is 'nationalistic' enough to favour the whole nation. © 2014 Southseries Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease Burden: Changing Patterns and Implications for Public Health in India,"Introduction: The link between air pollution-attributed cardiovascular disease (APACVD) burden and its contributing factors can aid in detecting vulnerabilities and providing forewarnings for India. Methods: We examined the association between the status and trends of the APACVD burden obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases and Injuries study with the two development metrics in India; the human development index (HDI) and indirect indices of economic development, namely annual new motor vehicle registration and the number of functional factories for 10 years from 2009 to 2019. Lorenz curves and concentration index were used to estimate the inequalities in the state-APACVD burden and the burden per 100,000 population. Results: At the state level, APACVD burden was inversely related to the HDI value in India for the years 2009 (r=-0.48), 2014 (r=-0.47), and 2019 (r=-0.37), and the association was statistically significant (p<0.05). The correlation between state-level APACVD burden with the annual new motor vehicle registration and the number of functional factories in India for these years was also positive and significant (p<0.05). The APACVD was 53% unequally distributed across the states, with a concentration index of 0.53 in 2009. Discussion: We observed that at the state level, the APACVD burden was inversely related to HDI. But the APACVD burden increased with the country's economic development. Also, the excess APACVD burden appears to be attributable to the economically developed states. Conclusion: At the state level, APACVD burden decreased as HDI rose over time, indicating that the burden increased with the country's economic development. It is noticeable that the economically developed states may be contributing a higher share of the APACVD burden in India. © 2022 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)",Not About Sufficiency
A research framework for studying social impacts: Application to the field of mining,"Given the growing amount of attention shown to the social dimension of natural resources and mining governance, there is a need for more informed research-oriented approaches to studying social impacts. This article analyzes the features of Social Impact Assessment (SIA) studies from the academic research perspective and presents a framework for social impact research. By academic research, the article refers to studies on social impacts conducted purely for research purposes, not impact assessment processes. Research is always one aspect of the SIA process. At the same time, there is a lack of general methodological literature offering guidance on how assessing social impacts can contribute to social studies research. The guiding documents on SIA are largely intended for practical-level planning and management processes, which limits their applicability for academic purposes. The proposed framework draws both from traditional social science methods and existing scholarly and guiding literature on SIA. The research framework consists of four interlinked phases: 1) research preparations, 2) background studies (including proposed project, national and local context), 3) fieldwork, and 4) analysis. The framework is designed to direct attention to the relevant aspects of research methods, theory building, fieldwork implementation, and research choices for data analysis. Thus, the framework provides a flexible, but comprehensive, multi-level approach for examining social impacts, which can be adapted for a wide range of social-scientific mining research. The analysis and developed framework will help academic researchers better study the social impacts of mining and make better use of existing SIA studies in academic life. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of Climate Change on Bangladesh: International Legal Discourses and National Legal Responses,"This introductory chapter explores the profound impacts of climate change on Bangladesh. It begins by identifying various adverse impacts of climate change, including the increased frequency of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and threats to food and water security. It examines the interplay between the law of the sea and climate law as an example of how legal regimes interconnect. This chapter argues that climate change is already a reality in Bangladesh. This country bears a disproportionate burden of the impacts of climate change. International climate law should address this unequal distribution of burden, particularly in adaptation as well as loss and damage-related discussions. It advocates for integrating the principle of equity in global and national climate actions to ensure climate justice. It urges the upholding of the rights of nature and the promotion of sustainable development. This chapter also summarises the book’s six parts and 20 chapters, providing an overview of the comprehensive legal and policy responses to climate change discussed throughout the book, highlighting Bangladesh’s unique challenges and legal strategies. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of Climate Change on Livelihood Security and Biodiversity – Issues and Mitigation Strategies,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our day, posing a threat to the lives and livelihoods of billions of people worldwide. Natural disasters, biodiversity loss, and rising temperatures destroy crops, diminish ecosystems, put livelihoods in jeopardy, and accelerate the spread of fatal diseases. Climate change mixes population trends, migration, and greater urbanisation, putting the most vulnerable people at risk. Climate change is the most important impediment to achieving sustainable development through biodiversity conservation, and it threatens to impoverish millions of people. Species distributions have changed to higher altitudes at a median pace of 11.0 m and 16.9 km per decade to higher latitudes as a result of climate change. As a result, under migration scenarios, extinction rates for 1103 species range from 21–23% with unrestricted migration to 38–52% with no migration. When an environmental change happens on a period shorter than the plant’s life, a plastic phenotypic may emerge as a reaction. Phenotypic flexibility, on the other hand, might protect species against the enduring impacts of climate change. Climate change also has an impact on food security, especially in people and areas that rely on rainfed agriculture. Crops and plants have growth and yield limits that must be respected. As a result, agricultural productivity in Africa alone might plummet by more than 30% by 2050. Climate change is already wreaking havoc on people’s lives, especially the impoverished. Because rural people rely on natural resources, their livelihoods are jeopardised by frequent climate change. The impact of climate change on natural resource-based rural livelihoods is anticipated to be uneven and ecosystem resilience will be strengthened as a result of biodiversity conservation, and ecosystems will be better able to deliver critical functions in the face of increasing climate stresses. Moreover, as a consequence of global influence, the warming trend has changed significantly over the years. In addition to ensuring the livelihood security of rural people, a number of adaptation approaches species and ecosystems in a changing climate may be recommended. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Crop establishment and weed control options for sustaining dry direct seeded rice production in eastern india,"Dry direct seeded rice (DSR) has emerged as an economically viable alternative to puddled transplanted rice to address emerging constraints of labor and water scarcity and the rising cost of cultivation. However, wide adoption of DSR is seriously constrained by weed management trade-off. Therefore, the availability of effective weed control options is critical for the success and wide-scale adoption of DSR. A field study was conducted at ICAR-National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, India, in the dry seasons of 2015 and 2016 to evaluate the performance of three crop establishment methods and five weed control practices on weed management, productivity, profitability and energetics of dry DSR. The results demonstrated that weed density and weed dry weight was lower in drill seeding than broadcast seeding by 26–36% and manual line-seeding by 16–24%, respectively, at 30 and 60 days after crop emergence (DAE). Among herbicides, post-emergence application (17 DAE) of azimsulfuron was most effective in controlling weeds compared to early post application of bispyribac-sodium and bensulfuron-methyl+pretilachlor. Weed competition in the weedy check treatment resulted 58% reduction in rice yield. Among establishment methods, drill-seeding was most profitable with US $ 685 ha−1 higher net income than broadcast seeding primarily due to higher yield. Among weed control treatments, azimsulfuron was most profitable resulting in US $ 160 and 736 ha−1 higher net income than weed free and weedy check, respectively. The specific energy was lowest for drill seeding among establishment method and azimsulfuron among weed control practices, suggesting lowest energy consumed in producing per unit of grain yield. © 2021 by the authors.

Emerging paradigms of viral diseases and paramount role of natural resources as antiviral agents,"In the current scenario, the increasing prevalence of diverse microbial infections as well as emergence and re-emergence of viral epidemics with high morbidity and mortality rates are major public health threat. Despite the persistent production of antiviral drugs and vaccines in the global market, viruses still remain as one of the leading causes of deadly human diseases. Effective control of viral diseases, particularly Zika virus disease, Nipah virus disease, Severe acute respiratory syndrome, Coronavirus disease, Herpes simplex virus infection, Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and Ebola virus disease remain promising goal amidst the mutating viral strains. Current trends in the development of antiviral drugs focus solely on testing novel drugs or repurposing drugs against potential targets of the viruses. Compared to synthetic drugs, medicines from natural resources offer less side-effect to humans and are often cost-effective in the productivity approaches. This review intends not only to emphasize on the major viral disease outbreaks in the past few decades and but also explores the potentialities of natural substances as antiviral traits to combat viral pathogens. Here, we spotlighted a comprehensive overview of antiviral components present in varied natural sources, including plants, fungi, and microorganisms in order to identify potent antiviral agents for developing alternative therapy in future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Organizational characteristics of the firm, including firm size, competitive position and degree of internationalization moderate these influences, leading to a firm's corporate environmental performance.

Rural Electrification and Transition to Clean Cooking: The Case Study of Kanyegaramire and Kyamugarura Solar Mini-Grid Energy Cooperatives in the Kyenjojo District of Uganda,"Access to electricity is fundamental to ensure basic human activities and is a direct measure of energy poverty. In recent years, significant steps towards rural electrification have been fostered by intergovernmental organisations with the scope to ensure energy security to all—especially rural people, the poor and the vulnerable. Cooking is a basic daily household activity and is strictly related to energy security. Nevertheless, in most developing countries and the rural world, cooking is still done through polluting, ineffective and dangerous kerosene stove and animal manure and primordial tools. To tackle this issue, pushed-down energy policies calibrated to enhance environmental, social and economic performances of rural households have to face ancient habits. This book chapter aims to analyze the feasibility of environmental preservation policies within cooking activities in Kyenjojo District of Uganda in terms of sustainability performance. The study is predicated on the field survey data with 63 households. The performed analyses indicate that electrification has not substantially changed the cooking behaviors of the households. Furthermore, the study analyses the causes for the lagging transition to clean energy use in cooking. We find that besides behavioural and taste aspects affordability and level of education play an important role in the context of the household-level energy transition. This significance of education may be imputed to the fact that poor rural people have not been educated about environmental protection and paves the way for new research explorations, bottom-up projects, sustainable development policies and energy transition modeling. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy Transition and Climate Justice After Paris Agreement: Achievements and New Goals in South America,"The objective of the chapter is to analyze the evolution of the decarbonization process of electricity generation in South America after the Paris Agreement in terms of climate justice, taking into account that this is a region with a low level of historical incidence of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), particularly in terms of emissions from the energy sector, and also a high degree of vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. The gathering of information and analysis techniques are based on documentary research, using two types of secondary sources of information: on the one hand, quantitative data on installed power, electricity generation, and sectoral emissions to analyze the relative position of the region and its recent evolution; on the other hand, qualitative data from the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), in order to examine the goals, sources, and obstacles to achieve electricity decarbonization. The findings corroborated the working hypothesis because the region as a whole has rapidly increased the incorporation of low-carbon sources in its electricity generation in relation to the group of the six highest emitting countries, despite the fact that South America started from a higher level in the decarbonization of the electricity mix and that climate change is affecting the generation capacity of its hydroelectric power plants. Likewise, nuances should be noted when analyzing the cases at the national level, given that the fast progress of some countries compensates for the slower speed of others. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Choosing the best city of the future,"This paper describes various possibilities of the cities of futures considering various constraints and demand of society, environment and geography. The need for future cities arises because of the rapid growth in population and thereby causing a decline in the living standards. In the United States itself, many people are moving to cities every day. Today cities are getting crowded and if the influx continues at the same rate, current cities will become unmanageable and unlivable. More population means faster consumption of natural resources which eventually leads to ecological imbalance. Already more than 80% of world׳s forests are gone. The food consumption has also doubled over the last fifty years and this has exerted pressure on the landscape through the use of artificial fertilizers. The use of artificial agents to boost agricultural productivity has significantly marred the flora and fauna leading to loss of a huge amount of bio diversity. Another problem with the increasing population and population migration to cities is the rise of congestion on the city roads. In the United States a person drives 7500 miles in 1600 h with an a average speed of 4.68 mph. To accommodate the population approximately 2000 trees are cut in a minute in the Amazon alone. On top of all that, with increasing wealth the average house size has almost doubled since 1970 and this has further caused the decline of arable land and forests. To deal with the problem of rising population and congestion within the cities, we need to plan cities of the future that will be able to utilize the available resources in a more efficient and cleaner manner. The future city project aims to delve into details of various future city models and aims to find out which model will be best suitable depending upon the strategic criteria that we have used to evaluate the various merits of the BOCR model. The four alternative kinds of cities are analyzed below according to their merits. They are A. Compact City, B. Elevated City, C. Green House City, and D.

Rwanda.,"Rwanda's population characteristics, history, government, political situation, economy, and foreign relations were briefly discribed. Rwanda, a small African country, covers an area of 10,160 square miles and is situated between Zaire, Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania. During the 1400s, Tutsi cattle breeders moved into the region and turned the Hutu farmers, the original occupants of the region, into serfs. The Tutsi maintained their dominant position until 1959. Rwanda was a German protectorate between 1899-1916 and a territory under the administration of Belgium following World War I. During the 1950s, the Tutsi resisted efforts by the Belgians to democratize the country, and in 1959, the Party of the Hutu Emancipation Movement (PARMEHUTU) overthrew the Tutsi monarchy. The PARMEHUTU leader, Gregoire Kayibanda was selected by the elected unicameral National Assembly to head the government following the granting of independence to Rwanda in 1962. In 1973 growing government inefficiency and corruption led to the takeover of the country by the military leader, Major General Juvenal Habyarimana, who in 1975 formed the National Revolutionary Movement for Development. Although civilian rule is being gradually restored, Habyarimana, who is now the elected president of the country, retains considerable power. In addition to the president, the country is run by a 17-member cabinet and a 70-member elected legislative body, the National Development Council. The current goverment is strongly committed to the developing the country's economy. Rwanda is a poor and overpopulated country, and its economy is based mainly on subsistence level farming. 93% of the work force is engaged in agriculture. 35% of the gross national product (GNP) is derived from agriculture, and the main agricultural products are tea, pyrethrum, and cinchona. Small-scale industries account for another 21.6% of the GNP. The government is working to increase the country's energy sources and to attract foreign investments. The country has some mineral desposits which contribute toward the country's foreign exchange. In 1984, the GNP was US$1.7 billion, the annual economic growth rate was 2.9%, the per capita GNP was US$270, and exports and imports were US$147.9 million and US$204.9 million respectively. Rwanda's population size is 6.3 million, and 85% of the population is Hutu and 14% is Tutsi. The annual population growth rate is 3.7%. The dominant religion is Christianity. The literacy rate is 37%, schooling is compulsory for 8 years, the infant mortality rate is 102/1000 live births, and life expectancy is 48 years. In 1981, the government established the National Population Office to develop and implement a national family planning policy. Rwanda follows a moderate and nonaligned course in foreign matters and maintains friendly relations with the US. In 1984 the US provided Rwanda with US$6.2 million in development assistance and US$1.5 million in food assistance. Most US aid is directed toward agricultural and health development.",Not About Sufficiency
Edible urbanism 5.0,"Urban and peri-urban agriculture can have negative effects (i.e., ecosystem disservices) to the city ecosystem. In the last two decades, urbanists and landscape planners have promoted urban agriculture and food systems with little attention to ecosystem disservices. At present, increased urbanisation, environmental degradation, population growth and changes in food systems require a novel concept that considers trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices. Considering the Sustainable Development Goal 2 of ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030, as well as the food revolution 5.0 of feeding up to ten billion people, edible urbanism 5.0 is a supportive component in reaching these goals. In this comment, edible urbanism via an edible green infrastructure (EGI) approach is examined against current urbanistic concepts that have common food production systems in cities. Moreover, a discussion on issues and challenges of public policy and governance for the implementation of sustainable food systems is shown with findings that consider current industrial intensive farming as somewhat unsustainable. Edible urbanism integrates three main principles of sustainability by fulfilling food security, resilience and social inclusion. It links site-specific, best-practices by integrating EGI-based governance with modernised food production techniques. Example cities showing EGI- and sustainability-oriented food concepts are presented. Recommendations for future edible urbanism (as a part of the next food revolution) are established. © 2019, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Mangrove ecosystem services: Contribution to the well-being of the coastal communities in Klang Islands,"Mangroves continue to be extensively replaced for alternative land uses despite global recognition of their value for ecosystem services. Limited effort has been directed into understanding how changes in mangrove ecosystems affect human well-being, especially in Asia. Using the inhabited Klang Islands, Selangor, Malaysia as a case study, this paper explores the relationships between mangrove ecosystem services and human well-being by adapting and modifying three existing conceptual frameworks. Semi-structured interviews with island residents were conducted to explore mangroves’ contribution to human well-being. Analysis revealed that respondents recognised examples of regulating, cultural, and provisioning ecosystem services resulted from their interaction with mangroves. While all three ecosystem services contributed to both basic human needs and subjective well-being, provisioning and cultural services were reported to also contribute to economic needs and regulating services, more strongly to environmental needs. These findings contribute to more inclusive decision-making processes concerning development and conservation planning in the fast-urbanised Klang which would affect the overall well-being of the communities in general, largely the Malay, Chinese and Mah Meri communities, and the fishers specifically. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Quinoa biodiversity and sustainability for food security under climate change. A review,"Climate change is rapidly degrading the conditions of crop production. For instance, increasing salinization and aridity is forecasted to increase in most parts of the world. As a consequence, new stress-tolerant species and genotypes must be identified and used for future agriculture. Stress-tolerant species exist but are actually underutilized and neglected. Many stress-tolerant species are indeed traditional crops that are only cultivated by farmers at a local scale. Those species have a high biodiversity value. Besides, the human population will probably reach nine billion within coming decades. To keep pace with population growth, food production must increase dramatically despite the limited availability of cultivable land and water. Here, we review the benefits of quinoa, Chenopodium quinoa Willd., a seed crop that has endured the harsh bioclimatic conditions of the Andes since ancient times. Although the crop is still mainly produced in Bolivia and Peru, agronomic trials and cultivation are spreading to many other countries. Quinoa maintains productivity on rather poor soils and under conditions of water shortage and high salinity. Moreover, quinoa seeds are an exceptionally nutritious food source, owing to their high protein content with all essential amino acids, lack of gluten, and high content of several minerals, e.g., Ca, Mg, Fe, and health-promoting compounds such as flavonoids. Quinoa has a vast genetic diversity resulting from its fragmented and localized production over the centuries in the Andean region, from Ecuador to southern Chile, and from sea level to the altiplano. Quinoa can be adapted to diverse agroecological conditions worldwide. Year 2013 has therefore been declared the International Year of Quinoa by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Here, we review the main characteristics of quinoa, its origin and genetic diversity, its exceptional tolerance to drought and salinity, its nutritional properties, the reasons why this crop can offer several ecosystem services, and the role of Andean farmers in preserving its agrobiodiversity. Finally, we propose a schematic model integrating the fundamental factors that should determine the future utilization of quinoa, in terms of food security, biodiversity conservation, and cultural identity. © 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.",Not About Sufficiency
Global Health Governance for Developing Sustainability,"Health is an intrinsically and indisputably global endeavor. Global challenges to the health of populations and to the planet are on the rise, as are concomitant calls for innovative strategies and “solutions” that aspire to contribute to the development of sustainability (Bensimon & Benatar, 2006). Increased economic globalization; the flow of trade, capital, and labor; widening gender and health inequities; increased migration; and planetary health are among the many complex issues that challenge nation-states, global institutions, and the overall governance of the global commons (or the commonly pooled resources at global, international, and supranational levels). Health has also become highly vulnerable in a global policy context dominated by growing interests in national security and economic competitiveness (Labonte, 2014). Efforts to “depoliticize” health and the work of global institutions such as the World Health Organization (WHO) dedicated to the achievement of health for all have not necessarily succeeded, and suggestions that health is not political have been repeatedly refuted (Kickbusch & Reddy, 2015). © Cambridge University Press 2011, 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
The variable paths to sustainable intensification in agriculture,"Continuing environmental degradation amidst economic growth and population increase has underscored the desirability of pursuing sustainable intensification in agriculture. In theory, it would increase the volume of agricultural production without further degrading the natural environment or compromising the food security of the world’s poorest people. In practice, difficult choices involving trade-offs between agricultural development and environmental protection have characterized most efforts at sustainable intensification. Against this backdrop, a series of studies have tried to identify an optimal strategy for sustainable intensification. This article argues that there is no one optimal strategy. Rather, optimal strategies vary across socio-ecological contexts. Distinct strategies of sustainable intensification have emerged (1) in peri-urban agriculture, (2) on large farms situated on prime agricultural lands, and (3) in smallholder-dominated agricultural districts. Government interventions to promote sustainable intensification should recognize and build on these distinct, place-based economic, and agro-ecological dynamics. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Unique extremophilic Bacillus: their application in plant growth promotion and sustainable agriculture,"A number of extreme soil environments exist due to variation in soil temperature, salinity, pH, etc. Extremophile microbes, specifically the Bacillus sp. residing in these soils or when added externally can adapt to such extreme environments, can enrich such soil with both macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) and micronutrients (zinc, iron, magnesium, etc.). A number of plant-rhizospheric Bacillus sp. are capable of fixing these nutrients, such as B. subtilis. B. mycoides are shown to survive in temperature range of 0°C-5°C with a rate of 3.9×106 and 107 cells/g of rhizosphere. Extremophilic strains have been found, and they can carry out plant growth-promoting activities in soils where there is drought stress, temperature stress (both high and low), pH stress, or salinity issues. Several cyclic lipopeptides, iturin A analogs secreted as volatile exudates and metabolites from species like B. vallismortis, B. licheniformis, B. subtilis, and B. megaterium have shown an immense role in accelerating the jasmonate signaling pathway of plant ISR (induced systemic resistance) inducing the broad spectrum resistance in plants. The Bt toxin secreted by B. thuringenesis is well-known for its insecticidal property. Species like B.insolitus, B. methylotropicus, B. mojavensis, etc. are known to directly affect the biomass, and other physiological attributes of crops. Various other secondary metabolites secreted by members of this family along with their endophytic nature and macro- and micronutrient fixing capabilities have been shown to improve plant nutritional grades and productivity. Thus this review aims to scale the impact of multifaceted enzymes, metabolites, and roles played by the members of the Bacillus sp. family toward sustainable agricultural practices. Thus using thermotolerant or thermophilic Bacillus sp. in high temperature regions, psychrophilic Bacillus sp. in cold stress areas, alkalophilic Bacillus sp. in alkaline soils, and acidophilic Bacillus sp. in acidic soils can enhance soil fertility in such areas and make the soil sustainable for plant growth and cultivation without chemical interference. Metalophilic Bacillus sp. on the other hand, found in highly metal contaminated areas, can have huge plant growth promotion activity in heavy metal-contaminated soils. Xerophilic Bacillus sp. in places of water scarcity and oligotrophic Bacillus sp. in low nutrient-containing infertile soils can also make such extreme soils fit for plant growth and agriculture. Therefore this chapter will shine a light upon extremophilic Bacillus sp. isolated from a variety of extreme conditions and their potential in plant growth promotion and soil sustenance. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Evaluation at the nexus: Evaluating sustainable development in the 2020s,"Evaluation is finally starting to recognise that humans, and our goals for human development, rights and security rest on our extraction from the natural system. Evaluators have until recently ignored the natural system, which has created a systematic positive and silo reinforcing bias in evaluation and risks rendering evaluation irrelevant for the major issues of the day - extinction and the climate crisis. As evaluation recognises and addresses its responsibilities to contribute to forestalling extinction it will need to mainstream sustainability, meaning that all evaluation will need to start from the nexus with connected human and natural systems. This requires an evaluation capacity and functions that are ready for sustainability. The pathway to evaluation that is sustainability-ready requires that all evaluation undertakings value the natural system and immediately recognise and address important differences between human and natural systems, scale, units of account and connectivity. The knowledge and methods exist in evaluation, social and biophysical sciences. The challenge is therefore not technical but political. It is political because the origins of evaluation and the social sciences on which evaluation rests are in the values and structures that are strongly founded on a claim that humans have dominion over all other things and that all value rests upon human effort. This claim of dominion extends to other, that is, non-European, humans and underpins colonialism and racism. Mainstreaming sustainability will prove challenging and for evaluation to progress it will have to elevate the importance of pursuit of use. The premise of this chapter is that evaluation has an important role in assisting sustainable development efforts get closer to a sustainable and productive nexus where we can make gains in poverty reduction and improve the environment in the present, thereby contributing to a sustainable and better future. Much has changed in the six years since the first edition of this volume was published. The inextricable connection between human and natural systems has been demonstrated with increasing intensity and frequency; wildfires, drought, flooding, cyclones and most recently the Covid-19 pandemic are translating the repeated forecasts and warnings of impending climate and sustainability crises into indisputable realities. What was termed climate change five years ago is now framed as climate crisis or extinction. We are clearly reaching the limits to extraction from the natural system, limits beyond which there does not appear to be a return. We also appear to be reaching new limits to the ability of capital to increase exploitation through increasing technology, destruction of labour and social protections, globalisation and state capture. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Juha I.

The ‘Palo a Pique’ long-term research platform: First 25 years of a crop–livestock experiment in Uruguay,"Mixed crop–livestock long-term experiments (LTE) are critical to increase the understanding of sustainability in complex agroecosystems. One example is the ‘Palo a Pique’ LTE which has been running for 25 years in Uruguay (from 1995 to present), evaluating four pasture–crop rotations under livestock grazing with no-till technology in soils with severe limitations. The results demonstrate that cropping systems reduced soil organic carbon (SOC) compared with permanent pastures, and that perennial pastures rotating with crops were critical to mitigate SOC losses. Data from the ‘Palo a Pique’ LTE has contributed to the establishment of new national policies to secure the sustainability of agricultural-based systems. Although the original purpose of the LTE was oriented to crops and soils, a demand for sustainable livestock intensification has gathered momentum over recent years. As a result, the current approach of the ‘Palo a Pique’ LTE matches each pasture–crop rotation with the most suitable livestock strategy with the common goal of producing 400 kg liveweight/ha per year. General approaches to the pursuit of sustainable livestock intensification include shortening the cycle of production, diversifying animal categories, increasing liveweight gain and final animal liveweight, and strategic livestock supplementation. Prediction of trade-offs between environmental, economic, and production indicators can be addressed through monitoring and modeling, enabling the timely anticipation of adverse sustainability issues on commercial farms. The ‘Palo a Pique’ LTE serves as a framework to address contemporary and future questions dealing with the role of ruminants on climate change, competition for land, nutrient dynamics, and food security. © 2020 by the authors.

Ecoresponsible actions in operating rooms: A health ecological and economic evaluation,"Background: In the current context of climate change, actions must be taken to improve the hospital's ecological footprint, particularly in the operating room, which is a major consumer of medical devices. Methods: This prospective pilot study assessed the ecological and economic impacts of sustainable actions targeting medical devices designed by a multidisciplinary working group and implemented in the 24 operating rooms of a University Hospital over one year. The ecological analysis was based on the life cycle assessment method and categorized in seven impacts. The economic impact was assessed by a micro-costing analysis and divided in four main expense items: human and material resources, logistics, and waste management. Results: In total, 13 actions were implemented with the aim of reducing waste volume, improving waste sorting, and increasing eco-responsible purchases. In one year, these 13 actions allowed avoiding the emission of 203 tons eq CO2. The environmental and human toxicity benefits were 707.8 and 156.2 tons of 1.4 dichlorobenzene, respectively. Concerning non-renewable resources, these actions avoided the extraction of 9 tons of oil (petroleum) and 610 kg of copper per year. These actions led to a land occupation reduction of 1071.3 m2year and to water saving of 552 m3. From the economic side, the implementation of these actions brought a gain of €3747.9 for the first year and of €5188.2 for the following years. Conclusion: The integration of sustainable measures in operating rooms leads to important ecological benefits and also generating savings. This more eco-responsible approach should be considered in all healthcare establishments that generate a significant annual volume of waste. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus of Myriophyllum spicatum L. under anthropopression – a case study from Upper Silesian,"The current type of global economy and environmental management requires a change in its approach to the use of natural resources in order to meet human needs. A system approach and an analysis of the importance of anthropogenic ecosystems appears to be an effective tool for sustainable development of urban and post-industrial areas. One example of anthropogenic ecosystems are mining water reservoirs, formed in the basins of subsidence, affecting the increase of biodiversity in the area poor in the surface water reservoirs. This study presents analysis of the impact of water quality in anthropogenic reservoirs on the Myriophyllum spicatum L. photosynthetic apparatus efficiency. Five reservoirs with different water quality were analysed. The photosynthetic apparatus performance of macrophytes was measured using the chlorophyll fluorescence signal through a Pocket PEA fluorimeter. The results showed that electron transport decreased with deteriorating water quality of reservoirs. This leads to a weakening of the population of Myriophyllum spicatum, which, as a further consequence, may lead to an acceleration of eutrophication of reservoirs. © 2019, Scientific Publishing House of the Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University.

The macroeconomic impact of future water scarcity: An assessment of alternative scenarios,"In this paper we consider some of the economic implications of climate change scenarios as described in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). By comparing potential water demand with estimates of (sustainable) water availability in different regions, we identify regions that are likely to be constrained in their future economic growth potential by the scarcity of water resources. We assess the macroeconomic impact of water scarcity under alternative allocation rules finding that, by assigning more water to sectors in which it has a higher value, shifting production to less water intensive sectors, and importing more water intensive goods, constrained regions can effectively neutralize these water related climate risks and adapt to a changing water environment. However, this adaptation effort is likely to imply some radical changes in water management policies. © 2017",Not About Sufficiency
System-Wide Implications of Changing Water Availability and Agricultural Productivity in the Mediterranean Economies,"We evaluate the structural consequences of water availability scenarios in the Mediterranean, following a multidisciplinary approach and a sequential modeling methodology. This includes an assessment of future water availability and a general equilibrium macroeconomic analysis of changes in agricultural productivity. Lower productivity in agriculture, induced by reduced water availability, generates negative consequences in terms of real income and welfare. The magnitude of the loss depends on the amount of the productivity shock, but also on the share of agricultural activities in the economy and on the stringency of the environmental regulation. We find evidence of a dramatic cut in the supply of water for agriculture in the Middle East. We consider alternative scenarios, differing in terms of stringency of environmental regulation and assumptions about water efficiency. The largest welfare losses turn out to be in Morocco and Tunisia, especially in the worst scenario NM. Other very relevant impacts can be observed in Turkey, Greece, Spain, Italy and Rest of Middle East and North Africa (XMENA). There are also clear differences among the scenarios. First, applying a constraint on the access to environmental water reserves only for Europe does make a big difference for non-European countries, implying that governments in the Middle East could respond to increasing water scarcity by accepting, to some extent, lower environmental quality (deterioration of aquatic environments). To avoid large drops in income and welfare, countries such as Tunisia and Morocco would not devote to environmental flows more than 10% and 5%, respectively, of their blue water resources. Second, improvements in water efficiency, as envisaged in the simulation exercise, appear to curb the economic impact of water scarcity quite significantly. This is especially true for countries in the North, whereas efficiency does not compensate for a strict environmental policy in the South. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Not About Sufficiency
The trouble with democracy: Political modernity in the 21st century,"Shows why the perception that we live in an era of human rights and incessant democratisation is dangerously misleading Western political thought has long maintained that democracy, once achieved, is here to stay. This view appears to be supported by successive 'waves of democratisation' across the world but, in truth, the political situation of our time is much more ambiguous. On the one hand, the commitment to democracy seems to be more widely shared than ever; on the other, popular will has ever less impact on political decisions because of alleged constraints in an era of 'globalisation'. Existing democracies suffer from a combination of technocratic governance and populist reactions. Global political communication has foundered with addressing urgent problems such as climate change, global social justice and economic-financial crises. By placing political condition of our time in its long-term historical context, this book radically reconsiders key issues of political thought and gives you a comparative exploration of the current experiences of democracy in several world-regions.

Cassava about-FACE: Greater than expected yield stimulation of cassava (Manihot esculenta) by future CO 2 levels,"Globally, cassava is the second most important root crop after potatoes and the fifth most important crop overall in terms of human caloric intake. In addition to its growing global importance for feed, fuel, and starch, cassava has long been vital to food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. Climate change is expected to have its most severe impact on crops in food insecure regions, yet little is known about how cassava productivity will respond to climate change. The most important driver of climate change is globally increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration ([CO 2]). However, the potential for cassava to enhance food security in an elevated [CO 2] world is uncertain as greenhouse and open top chamber (OTC) study reports are ambiguous. Studies have yielded misleading results in the past regarding the effect of elevated [CO 2] on crop productivity, particularly in cases where pots restricted sink growth. To resolve these conflicting results, we compare the response of cassava to growth at ambient (ca. 385 ppm) and elevated [CO 2] (585 ppm) under field conditions and fully open air [CO 2] elevation. After three and half months of growth at elevated [CO 2], above ground biomass was 30% greater and cassava root tuber dry mass increased over 100% (fresh weight increased 89%). High photosynthetic rates and photosynthetic stimulation by elevated [CO 2], larger canopies, and a large sink capacity all contributed to cassava's growth and yield stimulation. Cassava exhibited photosynthetic acclimation via decreased Rubisco capacity early in the season prior to root tuber initiation when sink capacity was smaller. Importantly, and in contrast to a greenhouse study, we found no evidence of increased leaf N or total cyanide concentration in elevated [CO 2]. All of our results are consistent with theoretical expectations; however, the magnitude of the yield increase reported here surpasses all other C 3 crops and thus exceeds expectations. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Methods for Measuring Greenhouse Gas Balances and Evaluating Mitigation Options in Smallholder Agriculture,"This book provides standards and guidelines for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions and removals in smallholder agricultural systems and comparing options for climate change mitigation based on emission reductions and livelihood trade-offs. Globally, agriculture is directly responsible for about 11% of annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and induces an additional 17% through land use change, mostly in developing countries. Farms in the developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia are predominately managed by smallholders, with 80% of land holdings smaller than ten hectares. However, little to no information exists on greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation potentials in smallholder agriculture. Greenhouse gas measurements in agriculture are expensive, time consuming, and error prone, challenges only exacerbated by the heterogeneity of smallholder systems and landscapes. Concerns over methodological rigor, measurement costs, and the diversity of approaches, coupled with the demand for robust information suggest it is germane for the scientific community to establish standards of measurements for quantifying GHG emissions from smallholder agriculture. Standard guidelines for use by scientists, development organizations will help generate reliable data on emissions baselines and allow rigorous comparisons of mitigation options. The guidelines described in this book, developed by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) and partners, are intended to inform anyone conducting field measurements of agricultural greenhouse gas sources and sinks, especially to develop IPCC Tier 2 emission factors or to compare mitigation options in smallholder systems. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and the Author(s) 2016.",Not About Sufficiency
Toilets in the hills.,"Population and Community Development Association (PDA) in Chieng Rai province in northern Thailand implemented its Environmental Sanitation for the Hill Tribes Project in March 1988 to reduce parasite infection and generate interest in self help development projects. As of early 1990, the hill tribes population growth rate stood at 4.5% compared to 1.5% in lowland Thailand. Other problems included villagers defecating around dwellings, not drinking safe water (since none was available), and not wearing shoes all of which contributed to a high rate of parasite infection. In fact, an analysis of stool samples revealed that parasites infected a mean of almost 70% of the villagers. PDA staff informed villagers about basic environmental health information which influenced them to improve sanitation conditions. They also demonstrated how to build the 1st model latrine. After that, each villager designed and constructed his own latrine. Each villager took out a Baht 150 (US$6) loan to pay for the construction materials (squat casings and cement) provided by PDA. Over the following 10 months, the staff returned to the villages to collect payments and to provide technical assistance. Those villagers that constructed a latrine persuaded others to also construct a latrine. In fact, villagers, not always PDA staff, have even transferred the knowledge to other villages. As of early 1990, villagers and staff have built 1000 squats and 993 latrines. With the health education and latrine use, PDA hoped to see a subsequent reduction in parasite infections. With the help of volunteer contraceptive distributors, PDA has also been able to expand its family planning program to 250 villages. It has also initiated a parasite control pilot project in the area in which infection rates have steadily decreased.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological change and the future of the human species: Can physicians make a difference?,"Global environmental change is occurring so rapidly that it is affecting the health and threatening the future of many of Earth's inhabitants, including human beings. Global warming; contamination of the air, water, and soil; and rampant deforestation have led to a collapse in biodiversity that threatens the integrity of the biophysical systems upon which all organisms depend. A basic cause of environmental degradation is human overpopulation and the nonsustainable consumption of natural resources by the human community. Everything that we have accomplished in the fields of medicine and public health could be undermined if we do not pay attention to these rapid environmental changes. As healers, human beings, and members of the biological community, we need to broaden our perspective on health and disease. Unless we devote our attention to stabilizing and repairing the ecosystem, our professional and personal accomplishments as health professionals may be swept away. Health care providers-particularly physicians-can play a role by adopting an ecosystem health perspective as we ply our trade.

Systematic review on urban ecosystem services in south-east asia: Asean countries,"Urban ecosystem services refer to all the benefits of nature especially to the urban community and economy for maintaining human well-being. This concept links to the economic, community and environmental aspects and shows how nature conservation is important for human and economic principles. However, the view of urban ecosystem services assessment based on essential categories with current urban development is provided. So, this paper reviews the aim to analyze the types and assessing the categories of urban ecosystem services and the meth-odological used in ASEAN countries. Furthermore, understanding studies about urban ecosystem services are important in long-term studies for monitoring purpose. As a result, 8 out of 10 ASEAN countries excluding Laos and Brunei have studied urban ecosystem services. In this context, the result also shows the most studies specify the significance of the ecosystem services given by the urban as regulating (waste absorption, climate regulation, water purification, flood regulation, and disease control) and followed by cultural (tranquility, social relations, and rec-reation). Thus, exploring urban ecosystem interaction in current ASEAN countries may have added benefits in terms of improving the urban ecosystem services to streamline the urban area planning. Finally, we conclude that all the ASEAN countries should play an important role to make sure the countries maintain sustainable and more livable with the right policies and guidelines like can fit in Paris Agreement especially in Climate Strategies and plans. © 2022, Politechnika Lubelska.

Spatial analysis of the impact of flood and drought on food security index,"This research aims to spatially analyze the impacts of climate change, specifically flood and drought on the level of food security in the Bengawan Solo watershed. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is significantly affected by the phenomenon. Flood and drought disrupt agricultural productivity, resulting in farmers having difficulty accessing their livelihoods. This has the potential to threaten food security. This research was conducted in the Bengawan Solo watershed which flows through three provinces on the island of Java. Widespread watersheds and inadequate infrastructure make it difficult to monitor so that the areas through which rivers flow are vulnerable to flood and drought. The impact of these climate-related problems on food availability makes this research important. This research was started with the calculation of the food security index in each regency/city in the Bengawan Solo watershed regions and mapped it with a Geographic Information System (GIS). The step then proceeded to the impact assessment of flood and drought on food security using the quantitative method of panel data regression in the 2014-2018 period. To sum up, flood and drought contributed in a negative way to the level of food security. Information about food security is useful in planning the allocation of resources by the government. Therefore, efforts to strengthen food security can be more directed according to the needs. © 2021 Technoscience Publications. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental innovation and the food, energy and water nexus in the food service industry","The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of environmental innovation on the balance of the food, energy, and water (FEW) nexus in the food service industry. The study was carried out through the completion of questionnaires by managers of food service companies in Brazil. Structural equation modeling (SmartPLS) was used for the analysis, which was based on 206 responses. The results show that food waste can be reduced by innovation in the planning of menus and purchases and in the process of food preparation. Furthermore, the reduction of natural resource consumption, especially of water and energy, can be achieved by leveraging changes in internal processes. In this sense, the typical trade-offs associated with the FEW nexus can be solved through environmental innovation. In addition, collaborative approaches between farms, suppliers and governments are essential for the implementation of the innovation processes. The paper presents suggestions for scholars, policy makers and managers in the food service industry to address the FEW nexus challenges. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency
Learning from integrated management approaches to implement the Nexus,"In the 1990s, the emergence of Integrated Management Approaches to water, land and waste established a widely accepted understanding on integration of environmental systems. Nexus Approaches try to often build on these. This paper assesses i) the intended goals and features of three Integrated Management Approaches (Integrated Natural Resources Management - INRM, Integrated Water Resources Management - IWRM and Integrated Solid Waste Management - ISWM) and two Nexus Approaches (Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus and Water-Soil-Waste (WSW) Nexus), and ii) how target systems and their integration are viewed in each of the Integrated Management Approaches. From this we assess commonalities and some lessons-learned for the Nexus. The method is based on a systematic literature review and a document analysis. From 1652 articles 52 peer reviewed papers were analysed. The results show that in terms of goals the Nexus Approaches are very similar to Integrated Management Approaches with the addition of clearly wanting to address governance and policy aspects e.g. in the WEF Nexus. Nexus Approaches try to move away from a single-resource centric view (e.g. WSW Nexus) and intend to go beyond resources towards sectors (e.g. WEF Nexus). It cannot be confirmed, that integration is clearly addressed in the analysed Integrated Management Approaches and what integration means is hardly defined. To provide some clarity for Nexus Approaches we propose a concept to describe integration by using “categories of integration” and the term “aspect” which includes systems, subsystems and other aspects alike. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
THE CURRENT ROLE AND IMPORTANCE OF AGROFORESTRY – A REVIEW ARTICLE,"Agroforestry has recently gained attention as it is capable of having multiple outlooks in both economic as well as product-oriented ways, also with its full potential can result in a sustainable life.

But, altogether cannot be solved in a single stretch except Agroforestry. The reason behind this is Agroforestry with its four dimensions namely regulating services, supporting services, cultural services and provisioning services has the potential to solve all these problems at a single stroke. The current area under agroforestry in India is estimated as 25.32 m ha, or 8.2% of the total geographical area of the country which should be increased to meet all the above-mentioned recommendations. The benefits which we get from agroforestry are innumerable. Additionally, substantial extent of areas of unproductive crop, grass, and forest lands as well as degraded lands could be brought under agroforestry. The places which are under the government but not used to its full potential has to be brought under agroforestry for the purpose of not only utilizing the land but also to derive some of the environmental and ecological benefits which it provides. Our knowledge on these issues is unfortunately rudimentary. Until such problems and negotiations are surmounted, the full potential and environmental benefit of the agroforestry will continue to be underappreciated and underexploited. © 2024, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.",Not About Sufficiency
Intraspecific trait changes in response to drought lead to trait convergence between—but not within—species,"Drought is expected to increase in future climate scenarios. Although responses to drought of individual functional traits are relatively well-known, simultaneous changes across multiple traits in response to water scarcity remain poorly understood despite its importance to understand alternative strategies to resist drought. We grew 52 herbaceous species in monocultures under drought and control treatments and characterized the functional space using seven measured above- and below-ground traits: plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, specific root length, average root diameter, and root dry matter content. Then, we estimated how each species occupied this space and the amount of functional space occupied in both treatments using trait probability density functions. We also estimated intraspecific trait variability (ITV) for each species as the dissimilarity in trait values between the individuals of each treatment. We then mapped drought resistance and ITV in the functional space using generalized additive models. The response of species to drought strongly depended on their traits, with species that invested more in root tissues and conserved small size being both more resistant to drought and having higher ITV. We also observed a significant trend of trait displacement towards less conservative strategies. However, these changes depended strongly on the trait values of species in the control treatment, with species with different traits having opposing responses to drought. These contrasting responses resulted in lower trait variability in the species pool in drought compared to control conditions. Our results suggest strong trait filtering acting on conservative species as well as the existence of an optimal part in the functional space to which species converge under drought. Our results show that changes in species trait-space occupancy are key to understand plant strategies to withstand drought, highlighting the importance of individual variation in response to environmental changes, and suggest that community-wide functional diversity and biomass productivity could decrease in a drier future. Knowing these shifts will help to anticipate changes in ecosystem functioning facing climate change.

From ecosystem integrity to ecosystem condition: a continuity of concepts supporting different aspects of ecosystem sustainability,"The current emphasis on sustainable development and ecosystem services promotes the need to better understand long-term ecosystem integrity and ecosystem functioning. This secures long-term provision of ecosystem services and ecosystem conservation. Ecosystem integrity or related notions are referred to in several national and international biodiversity and ecosystem policies that couples ecosystem integrity with human well-being. However, it is still poorly defined. The scientific literature has mobilized an array of terms and notions attempting to conceptualize and describe degrees of ecosystem intactness or alteration. Based on a review of papers proposing ecosystem integrity indicators, we identify five forms of ecosystem integrity which we define their specificities: ecosystem integrity of wilderness, ecosystem functional and structural integrity, ecosystem stability and reliance, ecosystem condition and ecosystem quality and value. These five forms gather into two main strands by the link to conservation ecology or to ecosystem services. Through this clarification, this work provides a platform for more streamlined and comprehensible development of policies and scientific agendas for sustainable development/conservation purposes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptive rangeland decision-making and coping with drought,"Grazinglands support the livelihoods of millions of people around the world, as well as supply critical ecosystem services. Communities reliant on rain-fed rangelands are potentially the most vulnerable to increasing climate variability given their dependence on highly climate-sensitive resources. Droughts, which are gradual natural hazards, pose substantial and recurrent economic and ecological stresses to these systems. This study examined management decision-making based on survey responses of 479 California ranchers to: (1) identify the types of drought strategies in-place across California's rangelands and the operation variables driving strategy selection; and (2) examine how individual drought adaptation is enhanced by decision-making factors. Four types of in-place drought strategies were identified and ordered along a gradient of increasing intensity (number) of practices used. Significant background variables driving strategy selection were operation experience with drought, type of livestock operation, grazing system, and land ownership types. Information resource networks, goal setting for sustainable natural resources, and management capacity all acted to enhance individual drought adaptation-defined here by active drought planning and the number of both reactive and proactive drought practices used. Overall, analyses revealed that flexibility in management is a key component of adapting to and coping with drought. Climate policy planning should take into account the diversity of strategies that have been developed by ranchers for multiple generations and within the context of their unique operations, as well as support these working landscapes via a range of adaptation and mitigation options to reduce vulnerability across all types of operations. © 2016 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency
Physiological and agronomic response of young ‘Verna’ lemon trees to the application of partial root irrigation compared to conventional deficit irrigation under conditions of high evaporative demand,"The cultivation of lemon fruits for the fresh market in Spain is located mainly in the southeastern region of the country, an area characterized by a high evaporative demand and the scarcity of rainfall, chiefly during the summer. Under these conditions, it is common to suffer scarcity of water resources, which forces lemon growers to apply irrigation doses that are below the water requirements of the crop. An alternative to optimize the use of available water is the application of deficit-irrigation strategies, such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and partial rootzone drying (PRD). Many studies were conducted on mature trees, but there is little information regarding the use of RDI and PRD in young lemon trees. Thus, this study was carried out to compare the effects of RDI and PRD during a period of high evaporative demand on plant physiological response, yield, and fruit quality of 2-year-old ‘Verna’ lemon trees during the first years of the plantation (2017-2019) in an experimental orchard located in southeastern Spain (Torre Pacheco, Murcia). Irrigation treatments included: i) full irrigation (control), where 100% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was supplied; ii) RDI, and iii) alternate PRD, where the irrigation dose was reduced at 75% ETc during the period comprised between May and mid-August. For the PRD treatment, during this period, the irrigated side was alternated every 28 days. Main results showed a better behaviour with PRD than with RDI. On the one hand, PRD reduced stomatal conductance and vegetative growth compared to fully-irrigated trees due to a change in the distribution of resources. On the other hand, PRD trees conserved a similar yield as that of control trees, and it allowed for the maintenance of crop water productivity. Based on these results, under water scarcity conditions, we recommended using PRD in young lemon trees; with this treatment, the entry into production of the crop was less affected. © 2024 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Governance to enable climate resilient development of healthcare systems – A conceptual overview,"Climate resilient development (CRD) is a future-focused solutions framework encapsulating climate adaptation and mitigation activities. It aims to prevent and prepare for the worst impacts of climate change whilst supporting sustainable development. When considering sustainability in healthcare systems, CRD goes beyond the current narrow focus on adaptation and mitigation to a more productive and integrated focus on how healthcare systems must equitably develop and transform to preserve the interconnected health of human and natural systems. The field of governance has received insufficient attention as a key determinant of CRD in healthcare systems, despite being a crucial enabling condition. It is through governance that climate resilient development policies are created, supported, implemented, and monitored. In this perspective we share a review that found no papers concerning how governance can enable CRD of healthcare systems followed by a broadened search which revealed a growing focus on elements of CRD (climate adaptation and mitigation) and barriers to climate adaptation and mitigation in healthcare systems. To respond to this gap, this perspective suggests there is value in jointly considering healthcare systems, climate resilient development and governance. We argue that transdisciplinary research combining these topics could provide practical and novel guidance for stakeholders involved in the pursuit of CRD of healthcare systems and could strengthen policy responses and actions. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Clarifying the current role of a social licence in its legal and political context: An examination of mining in Western Australia,"Despite growing prominence of the social licence to operate concept in natural resource developments, its role relative to legal and political approval processes remains unclear. This paper aims to identify social, political and legal license avenues and to understand their representation of public interest by examining mining in Western Australia. To achieve this we employed the social, actuarial/legal and political risk and licensing (SAP) model . The SAP model provided definitions of social, legal and political licences based on the assumption that all licences should represent public interest. Definitions from the model helped us to identify licence avenues from the relevant academic and grey literature and the assumption relating to public interest representation was examined by evaluating levels of direct public participation in the requirements and information gathering and decision-making processes of each licence avenue. Social licence avenues included social acceptance research, social impact assessments, social media, protesting and blockading. Legal licence avenues included the Mining Act 1978 (WA), Environmental Protection Act 1986 (WA), the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth), the Native Title Act 1992 (Cth), the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA) and the Mines Safety and Inspection Act 1994 (WA). Political licence avenues included State-agreements, government policies and State elections. Evaluating each avenue revealed strengths and weaknesses. General strengths in social licence avenues included higher levels of public interest representation through greater direct public participation, but weakness in the clarity of the decision-making process. Conversely, clarity in the decision-making process was a strength in legal and some political licence avenues, while lower levels of direct public participation were generally weaknesses. On this basis, we conclude that despite limitations, social licence avenues could have an important role to play in representing public interest in the West Australian mining context. Further consideration is given to how information from social licence avenues could inform legal and political licence avenues thereby strengthening political and legal licences to facilitate better outcomes for all parties involved. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Public preferences for policy intervention to protect public health from maritime activities: A 14 European country study,"Marine ecosystems provide a wide range of goods and services that directly and indirectly benefit economies and support human health and wellbeing. However, these ecosystems are vulnerable to anthropogenic influences such as climate change, pollution and habitat destruction. The European Union (EU) recognises the role of the blue economy in providing jobs and contributing to economic growth, with the EU Integrated Maritime Policy being a cross-sectoral framework within which maritime activities are managed and coordinated. Sustainability is a central tenet, ensuring that sectors such as aquaculture and offshore wind energy, which are earmarked for growth, must develop in ways that do not negatively impact the health of the marine environment. However, there is currently little consideration of how these activities might impact public health. The current research used survey data from 14 European countries to explore public perceptions of these issues, broadly focusing on 10 maritime activities, with a specific focus on five activities related to the EU's 2012 Blue Growth Strategy. The respondents appreciated the interconnections between these maritime activities, environmental protection and public health, as well as the potential trade-offs. Preferences for policy intervention to protect public health from different activities were predicted by both marine contact (marine sector employment, recreational activities) and socio-demographic (political attitudes, gender, age) variables, potentially aiding future engagement and communication initiatives. Substantive differences observed across countries in terms of policy preferences for different activities, however, warn against generalising for the European population as a whole. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Is Mining an Environmental Disamenity? Evidence from Resource Extraction Site Openings,"Extractive industries are often challenged by nearby communities due to their environmental and social impacts. If proximity to resource extraction sites represents a disamenity to households, the opening of new mines should lead to a decrease in housing prices. Using evidence from more than 6000 new extraction sites in Chile, this study addresses whether the heavy environmental and social impacts of digging activities outweigh their local economic benefits to the housing market in emerging economies. Findings from a spatial difference-in-difference nearest-neighbor matching estimator reveal that households near mining activity get compensated with lower rental prices, mostly in places with high perceptions of exposure to environmental pollution. Further analysis suggests that this compensation is lower among new residents of mining towns, which constitutes evidence of a taste-based sorting across space. Results in this study bring to light the need of incorporating welfare effects of potential social and environmental disruptions in future studies addressing the economic impact of new mining operations. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Concepts associated with health from the perspective of sustainable development,"The concept of health is a social construction defined by the historical-cultural contexts of societies. At the moment, this context is characterized by global challenges such as climate change, energy crisis, the north-south divide, and poverty, among others. In view of these challenges, sustainable development has emerged as a proposal to cope with these drawbacks of the Western development model. In this sense, it is plausible to suppose, in accordance with a new global scenario of sustainable development, that a new conception of health is also emerging. For that reason, this paper aims at identifying this renewed concept of health, together with related concepts which are mentioned in the official documents on sustainable development originated in the world summits. Despite the fact that the concepts of health and sustainable development have been understood as being equivalent, none of the aforementioned official documents has provided societies with an explicit concept of health. It was verified that the concept of health has been associated with that of need satisfaction and preservation of ecosystems, whereas the construct of illness is associated with the concepts of poverty and high consumption levels. Finally, it is concluded that health is an intermediate goal of sustainable development and not an end in itself.",Not About Sufficiency
Qualitative soil moisture assessment in semi-arid Africa - The role of experience and training on inter-rater reliability,"Soil and water management is particularly relevant in semi-arid regions to enhance agricultural productivity. During periods of water scarcity, soil moisture differences are important indicators of the soil water deficit and are traditionally used for allocating water resources among farmers of a village community. Here we present a simple, inexpensive soil wetness classification scheme based on qualitative indicators which one can see or touch on the soil surface. It incorporates the local farmers' knowledge on the best soil moisture conditions for seeding and brick making in the semi-arid environment of the study site near Arusha, Tanzania. The scheme was tested twice in 2014 with farmers, students and experts (April: 40 persons, June: 25 persons) for inter-rater reliability, bias of individuals and functional relation between qualitative and quantitative soil moisture values. During the test in April farmers assigned the same wetness class in 46 % of all cases, while students and experts agreed on about 60 % of all cases. Students who had been trained in how to apply the method gained higher inter-rater reliability than their colleagues with only a basic introduction. When repeating the test in June, participants were given improved instructions, organized in small subgroups, which resulted in a higher inter-rater reliability among farmers. In 66 % of all classifications, farmers assigned the same wetness class and the spread of class assignments was smaller. This study demonstrates that a wetness classification scheme based on qualitative indicators is a robust tool and can be applied successfully regardless of experience in crop growing and education level when an in-depth introduction and training is provided. The use of a simple and clear layout of the assessment form is important for reliable wetness class assignments. © Author(s) 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
Productivity and water use efficiency in processing tomato under deficit irrigation in Southern Italy,"In water limited environment, the irrigation of tomato crop should be performed to increase the water use efficiency, optimizing the fruit yield, the farmers income and preserving the water resource. The present study aimed to evaluate irrigation water deficit strategies, based on different levels of restoring the water used by the crop (crop coefficient method) in Southern Italy. Although by increasing the irrigation water (354-631 mm) the fresh fruit resulted raised (+ 20%), the water use efficiency resulted higher when the crop was submitted to water stress. The gross income resulted equal to 9588 £ ha-1 when irrigation fully satisfied the water consumption and of 1888 £ ha-1 greater than the stressed treatments. On the other hand, the net income per mm of water applied, resulted improved of 41% when comparing the stressed with the well watered treatment. The deficit irrigation strategies could play a key role in the water scarcity, water price raising and environmental safeguard perspective for tomato in Mediterranean environment.",Not About Sufficiency

Food stability model: A framework to support decision-making in a context of climate change,"Global environmental changes coupled with socioeconomic changes are major challenges to food security. Changes in climate affect most food crops, particularly in countries that rely on agriculture for subsistence. The article proposes a model to analyze food stability in the context of climate change. Genetic improvement, agrobiodiversity, sustainable intensification, climate monitoring, and market monitoring were considered key perspectives for the balanced scorecard to achieve stability in food production. The set of perspectives and indicators were validated by 185 experts, which supported the creation of a balanced scorecard map to assist decision-making. Therefore, the model could serve as an addition to FAO's approach to food security, driving actions related to global food policy.

The role of Eco-tourism in sustainable development: case study eco-tourism challenges in Iran,"Sustainable development is a new concept formed after the industrial revolution and the problems created concerning industrialization of cities and technological development of cities and linking different economic, cultural, political, and social development and exceptional attention to ecological considerations. Sustainable development has a comprehensive, integrated and human-oriented approach. It includes valuable concepts in preserving, promoting, and improving health and ecological integrity in the long term and providing human needs. Without destroying the next generation's ability and achieving economic dynamism, a livable environment and social equality are critical dimensions. The importance of conservation of natural resources in the urban environment is as significant as one of the essential areas of development of communities and, at the same time, a criterion for improving the quality of life. The consequences of urban development and the complexity of environmental problems have the inevitable existence of green spaces and their development. Due to the role of urban management in achieving sustainable urban development, this research tries to explain the concept of urban management, its objectives, and its components and provide effective urban management to achieve sustainable development. Eco-tourism is mainly based on resources that the natural environment is available to tourists that use it and appropriate conditions and requires protection of natural resources, which can be realized through evaluation of capability and capacity of the natural environment to attract tourists. The unique geography and diversity of natural phenomena caused Iran to be recognized as the fifth most crucial natural diversity globally, but planning for using these conditions is still not provided. In addition, the country's eco-tourism is faced with social, economic, and environmental problems, and for planning in the field of overcoming this challenge, we first need to recognize these challenges. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

An umbrella review of health co-benefits from actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"BACKGROUND: There have been many modelled studies of potential health co-benefits from actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but so far there have been no large-scale attempts to compare the magnitude of health and climate effects across sectors, countries, and study designs. METHODS: As part of the Pathfinder Initiative project an umbrella review of studies was done, and 26 previous reviews were identified with 57 primary studies included. Studies included in the review were required to have quantified changes in greenhouse gas emissions and health effects (or risk factors) from defined actions to reduce climate effects. Study data were extracted and harmonised by standardising impact measures per 100 000 of the national population (or urban population for city-level actions), averaging effects over a 1-year period and aggregating actions into their respective sectors by use of a predefined framework. FINDINGS: From 200 mitigation actions, the majority were in the agriculture, forestry, and land use sector (103 actions [52%]), followed by the transport sector (43 actions [22%]). The largest effects on greenhouse gas emissions were seen from actions in the energy sector, and these actions also had substantial health co-benefits in lower middle-income countries, although benefits were smaller in high-income settings. The greatest health benefits were seen from actions to change diets and introduce clean cookstoves. The major pathways to health were through reduced air pollution, healthier diets, and increased physical activity from switching to active travel modes. Effect sizes tended to be larger from national modelling studies and smaller from localised or implemented actions. INTERPRETATION: The potential co-benefits to health from actions to reduce climate change are large, but most evidence still comes from modelling studies and from high-income and middle-income countries. There are also major context-dependent differences in the magnitude of effects found, so actions need to be tailored to the local context and careful attention needs to be paid to potential trade-offs and spillover effects.

Social-ecological systems approaches: Revealing and navigating the complex trade-offs of sustainable development,"Studies of social-ecological systems (SES) have highlighted key elements including diversity, feedbacks, cross-scale dynamics, non-linearities and resilience in our understanding of the complex interactions between ecosystem services, human well-being and poverty alleviation. This chapter reviews studies on SES, particularly focusing on the conceptual and analytical advances made by projects and publications from the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) programme, to reveal often hidden patterns in trade-offs, power asymmetries, global and regional drivers, and historic and threshold effects, which were not previously obvious in the poverty contexts being studied. ESPA studies highlight the value of a wide diversity of interdisciplinary modelling approaches, teamed with concerted efforts to collect fit-for-purpose and long-term social, ecological and social-ecological data, as critical to the detection and avoidance of undesirable future trajectories and known or suspected thresholds. The Sustainable Development Goals, together with learning from the ESPA programme, provide a fertile ground to recognise and govern the complex social-ecological dynamics and feedbacks, the cross-scale drivers of trade and financial flows, the power asymmetries at work in the world, and the rapidly approaching tipping points in the climate and earth system. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Kate Schreckenberg, Georgina Mace and Mahesh Poudyal; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency

Substance Use among Emerging Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review through the Lens of Sustainable Development Goals,"Public health initiatives, including lockdowns to reduce the spread of COVID-19, have resulted in societal stressors like loneliness, job loss, and economic collapse linked to worsening mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and coping-related substance use. The various psychosocial stressors caused by the pandemic have potentially led to the increased use of substances across the globe, particularly among emerging adults. The current study summarises the literature on substance use among emerging adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The terms “coronavirus”, “COVID-19”, “substance use”, “substance abuse”, “drug use”, drug abuse”, “emerging adults”, and “young adults” were all used in different combinations throughout the search, using the Scopus, PubMed, and JSTOR databases. Using this method, a total of 28 English-language citations published between 2020 and 2023 were obtained. Following a study of the articles mentioned above, 16 papers were removed. The remaining 12 papers were included in this review. Even though substance use dropped when COVID-19 lockdowns began, it rose when restrictions were removed, particularly among those with prior substance use. Studies related to mental health need to assess substance use, as many emerging adults use substances to cope with distress, including isolation and loneliness, which are part of the current mental health crisis among emerging adults. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Forecasting Life Expectancy using Latent and Observable Factors: Effects of Urbanization on Mortality Modelling,"Sustainable development of the future is influenced by population growth, population ageing, migration, and urbanization. However, urbanization have adverse effects on environmental, social behaviour and health aspects, such as mortality risks due to climate change and infectious diseases. As the urban population is growing rapidly, there is a need to accurately forecasts these risks in anticipation of future ageing population, by developing a model to estimate and forecast mortality. Many existing extrapolative mortality models are described by latent factors, and it is difficult to understand the underlying dynamics of these factors. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis on the relationship between mortality index and urbanization growth were conducted. This study also aims to propose a new model that incorporates urbanization as an observable factor in modelling and forecasting mortality, by extending the Lee-Carter model. Result indicates that there is a possible long-run relationship between mortality and growth of urban population for all countries in the study. The proposed model provides better in-sample fitting for all countries. This study also predicts the life expectancy at birth based on the proposed model and life expectancy is forecast to reach age 85 for selected countries. Results also show that Malaysian adults ages between 20 and 40 years old are more likely to be affected by an increase in urbanization growth. Urbanization and mortality are key factors in planning for sustainable development of the future. Therefore, it is important to develop a mortality forecasting model that can account for the uncertainty surrounding urbanization. © 2025 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Redefining public health leadership in the sustainable development goal era,"Adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by member states of the United Nations (UN) has set a new agenda for public health action at national and global levels. The changed context calls for a reframing of what constitutes effective leadership in public health, through a construct that reflects the interdependence of leadership at multiple levels across the health system and its partners in other sectors. This is especially important in the context of Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) that are facing complex demographic and epidemiological transitions. The health system needs to exercise leadership that effectively mobilises all its resources for maximising health impact, and channels trans-disciplinary learning into well-coordinated multi-sectoral action on the wider determinants of health. Leadership is essential not only at the level of inspirational individuals who can create collective vision and commitment but also at the level of supportive institutions situated in or aligned to the health system. In turn, the health system as a whole has to exercise leadership that advances public health in the framework of sustainable development. This commentary examines the desirable attributes of effective leadership at each of these levels and explores the nature of their inter-dependence. © 2016 World Health Organization.",Not About Sufficiency
Indigenous food production in a carbon economy,"Indigenous communities in the North American Arctic are characterized by mixed economies that feature hunting, fishing, gathering, and trapping activities—and associated sharing practices—alongside the formal wage economy. The region is also undergoing rapid social, economic, and climate changes, including, in Canada, carbon taxation, which is impacting the cost of fuel used in local food harvesting. Because of the importance of local foods to nutrition, health, and well-being in Arctic Indigenous communities, there is an urgent need to better understand the sensitivity of Arctic food systems to social, economic, and climate changes and to develop plans for mitigating potential adverse effects. Here, we develop a Bayesian model to calculate the substitution value and carbon emissions of market replacements for local food harvests in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Canada. Our estimates suggest that under plausible scenarios, replacing locally harvested foods with imported market substitutes would cost over 3.1 million Canadian dollars per year and emit over 1,000 tons of CO2-equivalent emissions per year, regardless of the shipping scenario. In contrast, we estimate that gasoline inputs to harvesting cost approximately $295,000 and result in 315 to 497 tons of emissions. These results indicate that climate change policies that fail to account for local food production may undermine emissions targets and adversely impact food security and health in Arctic Indigenous communities, who already experience a high cost of living and high rates of food insecurity.

Eco-physiological and Biochemical Responses of Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) to Abiotic Stresses: Consequences and Mitigation Strategies,"Rapeseed yield parameters have been altered due to the increased exposure to abiotic stresses. The changing climatic conditions have reduced biomass production and seed yield, which ultimately affect the success of rapeseed crops. The severity and ability of abiotic stresses to act in tandem are a growing concern for agriculture producers across the globe. Rapeseed is one of the most vital cultivars in the world, serving as a major player in edible oil production. Abiotic stress conditions impose various effects on plant metabolism associated with growth stages, soil water storage capacity and plant physiological aspects. Modern agriculture aims to increased plant productivity to ensure global food security for the future. This can be achieved using quality seed, appropriate agricultural practices, measuring pest reduction techniques and understanding crop production challenges. Important tools, including conventional breeding and biotechnological approaches, can be employed to develop abiotic stress tolerance rapeseed. This review highlights the physiological and biochemical responses of rapeseed to abiotic stresses. The review also addresses conventional and modern stress mitigation strategies for the development of climate-smart rapeseed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"The nexus between intercropping systems, ecosystem services and sustainable agriculture: A review","In the face of aggravating environmental challenges, achieving food security while preserving natural ecosystems, the present-day agriculture demands transformative strategies. Intercropping, an age old yet under-recognized practice, offers a promising direction towards sustainable agriculture by elevating biodiversity, optimizing resource use and delivering critical ecosystem services. Intercropping contributes to climate change mitigation by improving soil health and carbon sequestration, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and long-term soil fertility restoration through nutrient cycling. Intercropping system aligns with agroecology principles, integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services into agricultural systems. Intercropping enhances provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services through multiple mechanisms. One of its key advantages is the promotion of biodiversity, which is essential for agroecosystem sustainability. By increasing species richness, intercropping nurtures pollinators, beneficial insects, and microbial communities, ultimately boosting productivity and resilience against environmental stressors. Moreover, intercropping represents an ecologically and economically viable alternative to conventional farming, confronting critical global concerns such as soil degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change. However, challenges such as choosing compatible crops, planning planting patterns, and coordinating harvest schedules pose huge tasks. Research findings on crop combinations, climate-resilient systems, mechanization tools, and region-specific information can help to overcome these issues. The review article focuses on the alignment of an intercropping system with ecosystem services targeting agricultural sustainability. © 2025, Gaurav Publications.

The impact of energy sector pollution on human development and inequality amidst climate change,"The provision of energy is a primary contributor to climate change and environmental pollution, the latter including air pollution from aerosol emissions and a broad range of other human health effects and ecosystem damages. At the same time, aerosol emissions also reduce radiative forcing, leading to a masking of part of the warming due to rising CO2 concentrations and temporarily reducing the adverse impacts of climate change. Using an energy-economy-climate model linked to atmospheric chemistry, health impact and life cycle assessment models, we show that the societal costs of the health impacts of environmental pollution substantially exceed the economic benefits from masked warming. We further highlight the unequal burden of these issues on developing countries and explore the implications for human development, global inequality and international climate policy. © 2024 The Author(s).

Holistic energy system modeling combining multi-objective optimization and life cycle assessment,"Making the global energy system more sustainable has emerged as a major societal concern and policy objective. This transition comes with various challenges and opportunities for a sustainable evolution affecting most of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We therefore propose broadening the current metrics for sustainability in the energy system modeling field by using industrial ecology techniques to account for a conclusive set of indicators. This is pursued by including a life cycle based sustainability assessment into an energy system model considering all relevant products and processes of the global supply chain. We identify three pronounced features: (i) the low-hanging fruit of impact mitigation requiring manageable economic effort; (ii) embodied emissions of renewables cause increasing spatial redistribution of impact from direct emissions, the place of burning fuel, to indirect emissions, the location of the energy infrastructure production; (iii) certain impact categories, in which more overall sustainable systems perform worse than the cost minimal system, require a closer look. In essence, this study makes the case for future energy system modeling to include the increasingly important global supply chain and broaden the metrics of sustainability further than cost and climate change relevant emissions. © 2017 The Author(s).

Sustainability assessment of virtual water flows through cereal and milled grain trade among US counties,"Transference of the embedded water, so-called virtual water, in the trade of crops among regions within a country is often neglected, leading to no information about the impacts on the water resources of exporting regions, especially if those regions are water-stressed or, worse, water-scarce. Virtual water trade, if not considered through the lens of sustainability, could lead to adverse effects on the water resources of an exporting region. Previous related studies have quantified virtual water trade among the states in the United States providing valuable insights; however, information for specific crop trade among counties, its water footprint (WF) at the county scale, the resultant virtual water flow among counties, and the sustainability assessment of those virtual water flows are lacking. In this study, we calculate the green and blue WF of cereal and milled grain products at the county level and then, using trade data, calculate the virtual water flows among the counties. Then, we assess the sustainability of the import by introducing unsustainable import fraction (UIF), which is the ratio of virtual water imported from water-scarce counties to that of total virtual water imported in the form of cereal and milled grains. Finally, we quantify the change in UIF from the 2007-2017 period. A few of the significant insights discovered through this analysis include: (i) most of the cereal and milled grains trade is occurring among neighboring counties; ii) one-third of US counties import 75% or more virtual water from water scarce regions; (iii) in 2017, Texas and Missouri were the largest importer and exporter, respectively; and (iv) the number of counties importing cereals and milled grains from water-scarce counties increased from 2007 to 2017. Recommendations on alleviating the negative effects of the unsustainable import of cereal and milled grain are provided toward the end of the discussion. © 2023 The Author(s).

THE ROLE OF THE HIMALAYAN MOUNTAIN SYSTEMS IN FOOD SECURITY AND AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY IN SOUTH ASIA,"Although South Asian countries made impressive progress in food production during 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the dynamism in the agricultural sector has, however, lost recently. Productivity of major food grains has slowed down and even declined, for some crops and food production is failing to keep pace with population growth. Therefore, food security has remained a major concern in South Asian countries. The linkage between food production and the Himalayan mountains is poorly understood though the Himalayan mountains are the major source of dry season water in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan for irrigated rice and wheat, which are the staple food in South Asia. In view of that this article briefly examines the role of the Himalayan mountain systems in food production and agricultural sustainability in South Asian countries looking at the emerging challenges posed by the increasing water stress and climate change. The analysis suggests that a common challenge is being faced by all South Asian countries-for increased food production to meet the demand of burgeoning population, the growing stress of water as rice and wheat, the staple food in South Asia, require huge amounts of water. Moreover, the increased food production in South Asia has to come from the same amount of land, by increasing productivity through bringing additional land under irrigation, as the frontier for expansion of agricultural land has almost been exhausted. The availability of irrigation water is, therefore, critical for increased food production and agricultural sustainability in entire South Asia. Climate change introduces a new challenge to agriculture and food security in South Asia. Recent studies suggest that the impact of climate change on cereal production in South Asia could be negative and that may be as high as 18.2-22.1 per cent. Our analysis reveals that the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain systems play a significant role in agriculture and food security in South Asia through water supply, climate and wind regulation, groundwater recharge and in sustaining wetland ecosystems. It is the major source of dry season water for several large river systems, such as the Indus, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra from the snow and glacier melt of the Himalayas, which provide the main basis for surface and groundwater irrigation. These three rivers form the largest river basins (Indo-Ganga-Brahmaputra) which are the major source of rice and wheat in South Asia. Besides surface water, the contribution of mountain discharge to groundwater is also significant, which makes it an important resource for agriculture and food security in South Asia. In addition to providing surface and groundwater, the Himalayan mountain system provides huge inputs to agriculture through regulating micro-climates as well as wind and monsoon circulation, and by supporting river and wetland ecosystems in South Asia. It is estimated that the Ganges river ecosystem alone supports 25,000 or more species, ranging from micro-organisms to mammals, which support agricultural sustainability and provide livelihoods for millions of people. This article concludes that the long-term agricultural sustainability and food security of South Asia is heavily dependent on the water and other ecosystem services it receives from the Himalayan ecosystems. Attention therefore must be paid to conserve the Himalayan ecosystems in order to ensure sustained flow of ecosystem services required for agriculture, food production and overall well-being of Himalayan and downstream population. Options and opportunities for enhancing the agricultural sustainability and food security by sustainable utilization of Himalayan resources and ecosystem services are briefly analyzed and suggestions have been made.",Not About Sufficiency
Embedding justice into climate policy and practice relevant to tourism,"Climate change in tourism discussions rarely address justice concerns. This work critically examines the intricate relationship between climate change, climate justice, and tourism, emphasising the urgent need for a holistic approach to address the interconnected challenges of tourism-related sustainable development. The paper builds on a climate justice framework encompassing recognition, procedural, distributive, and restorative justice to systematically connect justice dimensions to the climate change-tourism nexus. A shift towards a performative justice framework includes all notions of justice and underscores the significance of examining the various justice challenges when embedding justice into climate policymaking. Enhancing visibility of climate justice should foster collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and advocates for climate justice. Ultimately, this article advocates for the development of just climate policies and practices, and an inclusive socio-economic transition at the local, global, and intergenerational levels. © 2024 The Author(s).

Efficiency of small-scale farmer’s conservative behavior on their food security status in Iran,"There is a strong relationship between water and soil conservation practices and food security in Lorestan province in Iran. Socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors effect adoption of conservation practices in the region. The food security status of 296 random households was assessed with face-to-face interviews using the Household Food Insecurity Assess Scale. Our findings revealed that 78.7% of the sampled households experienced varying levels of food insecurity, including marginal (22%), moderate (10%), and severe (46%) status, while 21.3% were food secure. Among the surveyed farmers, water conservation exhibited a stronger correlation with food security compared to soil conservation. We identified several key factors, including education, employment, microcredit funds, NGOs’ supports, and government subsidies that influenced the adoption of different water and soil conservation practices. To effectively manage water and soil resources while considering socioeconomic factors, food security status, and the preservation of limited resources, it is crucial to reevaluate the existing practices and policies governing resource management in the study area. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Does intercropping enhance yield stability in arable crop production? A meta-analysis,"The adverse effects of climate change are significantly decreasing yield levels and yield stability over time in current monocropping systems. Intercropping (IC), i.e. growing more than one species simultaneously in the same field, often increases resource use efficiency and agricultural productivity compared with growing the component crops solely and can enhance yield stability. This meta-analysis of published IC literature quantified and analysed yield stability in IC compared with the respective sole crops, focusing on the effect of intercrop components (e.g. cereal-grain legume, non-cereal-grain legume), experimental patterns (e.g. experiment over years, experiment over locations), IC design (e.g. additive and replacement) and climatic zone (e.g. tropical, subtropical, and temperate). In total, 33 articles were analysed. The coefficient of variation (%CV) of yields was used for assessing yield stability, with lower CV value indicating higher yield stability. The analysis showed that cereal-grain legume IC (CV = 22.1) significantly increased yield stability compared with the respective grain legume sole crops (CV = 31.7). Moreover, compared with the respective cereal and legume sole crops, IC in the cereal-grain legume systems gave higher yield stability than IC in the non-cereal-grain legume systems. Compared with the respective cereal (CV = 25.3) and legume (CV = 30.3) sole crops, IC (CV = 19.1) in a replacement design had significantly (P < 0.05) higher yield stability. Also intercropping in replacement design gave more stable yields than IC in an additive design. In tropical regions, cereal sole crops (CV = 26.3) showed lower yield stability than IC (CV = 17.7) and legume sole crops (CV = 21.7). However, IC in all climatic zones showed higher yield stability than both sole crops. Moreover in our analysis, it was found that a higher yield level provided higher yield stability in crop production. Thus, increasing crop diversification through IC of cereals and grain legumes can enhance yield stability and food security, making an important contribution to eco-functional, ecological or sustainable intensification of global food production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Food security under unreliable rainfall: The case study of a rural community in Limpopo Province, South Africa","The present study assessed the use of a geothermal hot spring water flow as an adaptation practice to improve subsistence crop production. The aim of this study is to contribute towards natural resource use and management as an adaptation measure to the problem of rainfall scarcity in subsistence production. Focus group discussions with 45 subsistence farmers were conducted in a community garden in which subsistence crops are grown and maintained through a hot spring irrigation system. The study results show that the farmers are aware that rainfall in Sagole community is becoming scarce. The scarcity of rainfall is impacting negatively on subsistence crop production which is characterised by poor productivity. However, the farmers developed an irrigation system downstream of the geothermal hot spring in which the water is furrowed to the garden to irrigate vegetables and fruits throughout the year. © 2020 The Author.",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental change, aquatic conditions, and household food security: evidence from Lake Malawi","Food insecurity is a key barrier to improving global health and achieving sustainable development. Nearly 30% of the world’s population experiences moderate or severe food insecurity, and rates of hunger have risen in recent years. Environmental change is a major factor driving this increase, as warming air and water temperatures, extreme weather, and land use change can threaten food production. We argue that an important, yet underexplored, pathway between environmental change and food insecurity is through aquatic conditions and fisheries. We focus on Malawi, which is heavily dependent on fish consumption and experiences high rates of food insecurity. By linking nationally representative household survey data from 2010 through 2020 to remotely sensed chlorophyll and lake surface temperature data from Lake Malawi, we examine the relationship between changing aquatic conditions and food security among households located near the lakeshore. We find that warmer-than-average lake temperatures are negatively associated with multiple food security indicators including Food Consumption Score, self-reported adequacy of food consumption, consumption of dried fish, and consumption of animal protein during four of more days in the prior week. These findings provide insight into the linkages between environmental change, aquatic conditions, and population health, and can inform policies to reduce food insecurity, particularly among fisheries-dependent communities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Climatic conditions and household food security: Evidence from Tanzania,"Food security and adequate nutrition are critical for achieving progress toward sustainable development. Two billion people worldwide experience moderate to severe food insecurity, and rates of hunger have increased over the past several years after declining steadily for decades. The FAO attributes this increase in large part to climate change, though empirical evidence on the relationship between climatic conditions and food security remains limited. We examine this question by linking nationally representative longitudinal data from four rounds of the Tanzania National Panel Survey to high-resolution gridded climate data. We then estimate a set of fixed effects regression models to understand the linkages between recent rainy season precipitation and temperature and two indicators of household food security: Food Consumption Score (FCS) and reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI). We find that low rainfall—particularly dry and cool conditions—is negatively associated with food security. Moving from a typical rainfall year to a particularly dry one increases the risk of being food insecure on both measures simultaneously by 13 percentage points. This suggests that a lack of rainfall impedes households’ ability to access food, likely through reduced agricultural production and increased food prices, leading to lower dietary diversity and food shortages. Vulnerability is higher among households with fewer working age members, suggesting that households with a greater supply of labor can better withstand droughts. As climate change alters precipitation and temperature patterns over the coming decades, policies to increase resilience will be critical for improving food security, particularly among populations heavily reliant on agriculture. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Virtual water - Part of an invisible synergy that ameliorates water scarcity: Commentary,"Prof. Allan (this volume) argues that there is sufficient water in the world to meet current and future water needs, mainly because there are three processes in what he calls a threefold synergy: soil water, virtual water and the socioeconomic development that enables economies to trade their way to water security. In these comments, I argue that the virtual water argument does not hold true and that, although it is a useful concept to remind us of the water scarcity in some regions of the world, it is a concept that does not have significant implications on water and agricultural policy. These comments also include some reflections about the question regarding a possible water crisis in the future, the supply and demand of water resources, and the EU/USA agricultural subsidies.

Yield and economic impact of less-water consumption techniques in tank irrigated rice (Oryza sativa) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) crops,"A study was conducted with a view to reduce uncertainty of inflows in supply channels, weed infestation in tank bed and water scarcity during poor monsoon seasons. The less-water consuming technologies and use of improved implements along with matching crop production techniques were demonstrated to improve water productivity. Altogether, the mind-set of tank farmer that more the irrigation, more the yield was changed to controlled irrigation for more production. The new habit of 'measure and use' policy even in irrigation water was infused. The water productivity was realized in such a way that the productivity of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in whole command increased from 4.6 kg/ha/mm in 2005 to 7.3 kg/ha/mm in 2009; in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) from 5.6 kg/ha/mm in 2005 to 6.5 kg/ha/mm in 2009. Hence the economic impact of 'measure and use' policy was proved its superiority for less-water consumption management in tank irrigation in the cases of rice and groundnut. © 2015, Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

"Stimulus of developmental projects to landscape dynamics in Uttara Kannada, Central Western Ghats","Unplanned large scale developmental projects in recent times have been causing alterations in land use land cover [LULC] at spatial and temporal scales with the substantial changes in the landscape. Uttara Kannada district has the distinction of having highest forest cover in India. Forest ecosystems in the district have witnessed major transformations due to industrialization during the post-independence. Impact of developmental activities during the post-independence era, is evident from barren hill tops due to deforestation. The analysis of temporal spatial data acquired through space borne sensors highlights the decline of evergreen-semi evergreen forest cover from 67.73% (1973) to 32.08% (2013). The ad-hoc approaches adopted in the implementation of developmental projects in the ecologically sensitive regions has impaired the ecosystem services affecting the people's livelihood. The changes in the landscape structure with LULC changes have altered the functional abilities of an ecosystem evident from lowered hydrological yield, disappearing perennial streams, higher instances of human-animal conflicts, declined ecosystem goods, etc. About 64355 Ha of forest land is diverted for various non-forestry activities during the last four decades by the government apart from encroachment of 7072 Ha of forest area for agriculture, horticulture activities, etc. Encroachment of forest land has resulted in the land degradation leading to reduced productivity. Alterations in bio-geo chemical and hydrological cycles have necessitated the restoration of native forests in the region to ensure water and food security, and livelihood of the local people. Monitoring and visualization of landscape dynamics helps in evolving appropriate management strategies. LULC dynamics analyses considering agents (developmental projects) through fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated with Markov cellular automata (CA) indicate the developmental projects such as West Coast Paper Mill (WCPM) and Kaiga Nuclear Power House (KNPH) will lead to further fragmentation of forests with spurt in urbanization by 2022. This necessitates framing appropriate policy measures to sustain natural resources focusing on the landscape's ecological, hydrological, economic and social factors. © 2016 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable development of biofuels: Prospects and challenges,"In the context of shrinking crude oil reserves, rising demand and the resultant rise in prices of petroleum, as well as the concerns about global climate change and energy security, bioenergy is becoming increasingly relevant as a possible and potential alternative to fossil fuels. However, with many developed countries pursuing aggressive policies for encouraging the production and use of biofuels, there are strong apprehensions that as more and more land is brought under biofuel crops, food prices would increase substantially affecting poor consumers, particularly those from low-income net food importing countries. Keeping in view these facts, this paper presents a brief overview of the current state of affairs of biofuels at the global level, with a special emphasis on the ongoing efforts of biofuel expansion in India. It throws light on the various policies at the national and regional levels and also on the implications of biofuels for changes in land utilisation, food security, social welfare and the environment. © 2009, Economic and Political Weekly.

Water pollution by industrial effluents in India: Discharge scenarios and case for participatory ecosystem specific local regulation,"Around the world as countries are struggling to arrive at an effective regulatory regime to control the discharge of industrial effluents into their ecosystems, Indian economy holds a double edged sword of economic growth and ecosystem collapse. This situation if mishandled can cause irreparable ecological harm in the long term well masked by short term economic prosperity. Considering that Industries comply with environmental regulations based on the level of enforcement and their ability to spend for waste treatment, this paper endeavours to sketch probable industrial effluent discharge scenarios under various market-enforcement conditions and proposes possible strategies for effective regulatory regime in India. The authors point out that as India moves towards stricter regulation of industrial effluents to control water pollution greater efforts are required to reduce the risk to public health as toxic pollutants which are mainly colourless and odourless can be expected to be released into the ecosystems. Examples of emerging cases like Tiruppur and Plachimada are presented to assert that ecosystem specific discharge standards is the solution and local communities are ready to participate in environmental decision making to safeguard their resources. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Pro-environmental behavior: The role of public perception in infrastructure and the social factors for sustainable development,"The importance of public participation in the successful implementation of climate change-related policies has been highlighted in previous research. However, existing environmental behavioral studies have not sufficiently addressed the relationship among perceptions of climate change, living conditions, social demographic factors and environmentally friendly behavior. Therefore, this paper investigates whether environmental perception and other social determinants such as living conditions and the subjective evaluation of social inequality affect environmentally friendly behavior. We use survey data (N = 1500) collected in Mumbai, India, and analyze our hypotheses using a structural equation model (SEM). The empirical results confirm the direct and indirect influences of environmentally related perceptions, the subjective evaluation of living environments, social factors and other demographic characteristics on pro-environmental behavior. In particular, we find a robust positive effect of education level on pro-environmental behavior, where we observe both a direct impact and an indirect impact through positive effects on environmental knowledge. Thus, we confirm the importance of living environment, social equality and education in sustainable urban planning and efforts to mitigate climate change. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Field assessment of yield and its contributing traits in cowpea treated with lower, intermediate, and higher doses of gamma rays and sodium azide","Across the globe, plant breeders of different organizations are working in collaboration to bring preferred traits to crops of economic importance. Among the traits, “high yielding potential” is the most important as it is directly associated with food security and nutrition, one of the sustainable development goals. The Food and Agriculture Organization acknowledges plant breeders’ role and efforts in achieving local and global food security and nutrition. Recognizing the importance of pulses and increasing pressure on food security, the United Nations General Assembly declared 2016 the “International year of Pulses” owing to their preferred traits such as climate change resilience, wide adaptability, low agriculture input, and protein- and nutrient-rich crops. Keeping all these developments in consideration, we initiated an induced mutagenesis program by treating cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) with different doses of gamma rays and sodium azide aiming to enhance the yielding potential of an otherwise outstanding variety viz., Gomati VU-89 and Pusa-578. We noticed a substantial increase in mean values of agronomic traits in putative mutants raised from seeds treated with lower and intermediate doses of mutagens. Statistical analysis such as correlation, path, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to assess the difference between mutagenized and control populations. A significant and positive correlation of yield with yield-attributing traits was recorded. However, among all the yield attributing traits, seeds per pod (SPP) depicted the maximum direct impact upon yield, and therefore, working on this trait may yield better results. A widely used PCA revealed 40.46% and 33.47% of the total variation for var. Gomati VU-89 and var. Pusa-578, respectively. Cluster analysis clustered treated and control populations into separate clusters with variable cluster sizes. Cluster V in the variety Gomati VU-89 and cluster V and VI in the variety Pusa 578 comprised of putative mutants were higher yielding and hence could be recommended for selection in future breeding programs. We expect to release such mutant lines for farmer cultivation in Northern parts of India depending on the performance of such high-yielding mutant lines at multilocations.

Biotic and Economic Impacts of Plant Invasions,"The invasion of alien species manipulates the structure, function, and composition of the recipient ecosystem causing ecological, economic, and social impacts. However, these impacts can be positive or negative, depending on the effect and context of the invasion. In some cases, invasions enhance primary productivity of the ecosystem and increase species richness. On the other hand, in the majority of cases, the invasive species displace native species, adversely impacting native ecosystem and jeopardizing natural resources. The outcome of the impacts is based on several factors, such as mode of introduction, type of invasive species, condition of the invaded habitat, and characteristics of native species. For instance, specialist native species are predicted to suffer adverse effects, while generalists may flourish even when invasive species are abundant. There has been considerable debate in recent times about whether claims of severe impacts of invasive species are exaggerated and whether efforts to manage them are unnecessary or even harmful, and some unintended consequences of invasive species management have been documented. Regardless of the lack of consensus on the impacts of invasive species, they are posing a measurable cost to society. Invasive species severely affect agriculture, fisheries, tourism, forestry, and property values. Countries that rely on agriculture with small landholders are the most vulnerable to the invasion of exotic species. The rate of spread of invasive species is currently surging due to increased travel, trade, and transport in combination with climate change. Accurate and comprehensive information on economic and environmental impacts of invasive species is seriously lacking, and more research is needed to develop management strategies based on the impacts of invasive species. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment and selection of the best treatment alternative for infectious waste by Sustainability Assessment of Technologies (SAT) methodology,"The objective of this paper was to select the best infectious waste treatment alternative by Sustainability Assessment of Technologies (SAT) methodology. This study was carried in four educational hospitals of Ardabil University of Medical Sciences. The average waste produced in hospitals was 4.7 kg/bed/day. The average of common waste, infectious waste, sharp waste, and chemical and pharmaceutical waste was 2.18, 2.42, 0.04, and 0.05 kg/bed/day, respectively. In detailed assessment, a weighted sum matrix method was used to rank the different technologies of infectious wastes treatment. Finally, the highest score was found for Autoclave with a shredder (64.53), and hydroclave (63.32), autoclave (60.61), central incineration (55.12) and chemical treatment (54.25) were ranked second to fifth, respectively. Most participants emphasized the need for an autoclave with a shredder in the treatment of infectious hospital waste in Ardabil. However, the environmental and economic criteria and other aspects of treatment infectious hospital waste should be considered. Implications: Today health-care wastes (HCWs) have become a substantial public health and environmental concern all over the world, particularly in developing countries. In response to the need for a technology assessment framework to identify and select the best possible environmental technology option, IETC-UNEP developed a new methodology known as Sustainable Assessment of Technologies (SAT). The methodology takes a systems approach and stresses information, expertise and stakeholder participation. In applying this methodology to developing countries, it seems necessary to make some changes on its criteria, based on local conditions. © 2020, © 2020 A&WMA.",Not About Sufficiency
Determinants of life expectancy in most polluted countries: Exploring the effect of environmental degradation,"Background Better understanding of the determinants of national life expectancy is crucial for economic development, as a healthy nation is a prerequisite for a wealthy nation. Many socioeconomic, nutritional, lifestyle, genetic and environmental factors can influence a nation's health and longevity. Environmental degradation is one of the critical determinants of life expectancy, which is still under-researched, as the literature suggests. Objectives This study aims to investigate the determinants of life expectancy in 31 world's most polluted countries with particular attention on environmental degradation using the World Bank annual data and British Petroleum data over the period of 18 years (2000-2017). Methods The empirical investigation is based on the model of Preston Curve, where panel corrected standard errors (PCSE) and feasible general least square (FGLS) estimates are employed to explore the long-run effects. Pairwise Granger causality test is also used to have short-run causality among the variables of interest, taking into account the cross-sectional dependence test and other essential diagnostic tests. Results The results confirm the existence of the Preston Curve, implying the positive effect of economic growth on life expectancy. Environmental degradation is found as a threat while health expenditure, clean water and improved sanitation affect the life expectancy positively in the sample countries. The causality test results reveal one-way causality from carbon emissions to life expectancy and bidirectional causalities between drinking water and life expectancy and sanitation and life expectancy. Conclusion Our results reveal that environmental degradation is a threat to having improved life expectancy in our sample countries. Based on the results of this study, we recommend that: (1) policy marker of these countries should adopt policies that will reduce carbon emissions and thus will improve public health and productivity; (2) environment-friendly technologies and resources, such as renewable energy, should be used in the production process; (3) healthcare expenditure on a national budget should be increased; and (4) clean drinking water and basic sanitation facilities must be ensured for all people. © 2022 Rahman et al.

Analysis of Climate Change Impacts on the Food System Security of Saudi Arabia,"Climate change poses a challenge to the security and long-term viability of the global food supply chain. Climate unpredictability and extreme weather events have significant impacts on Saudi Arabia’s vulnerable food system, which is already under stress. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia faces distinct challenges in comparison to other dry locations across the world. Here, the per capita water demand is high, the population is growing, the water resources are extremely limited, and there is little information on the existing groundwater supplies. Consequently, it is anticipated that there will be formidable obstacles in the future. In order to make data-driven decisions, policymakers should be aware of causal links. The complex concerns pertaining to the Saudi Arabian food system were analyzed and rationally explained in the current study. A causality analysis examined different driving factors, including temperature, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, population, and gross domestic product (GDP) that cause vulnerabilities in the country’s food system. The results of the long-run causality test show that GDP has a positive causal relationship with the demand for food, which implies that the demand for food will increase in the long run with an increase in GDP. The result also shows that Saudi Arabia’s GDP and population growth are contributing to the increase in their total GHG emissions. Although the Kingdom has made some efforts to combat climate change, there are still plenty of opportunities for it to implement some of the greatest strategies to guarantee the nation’s food security. This study also highlights the development of appropriate policy approaches to diversify its import sources to ensure future food security. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Workshop 4 (synthesis): Securing food production under climate variability - Exploring the options,"Climate variabilities may result in different types of dry spells, droughts or flood situations, having harmful effects on agricultural productivity and food security. Long-term trends in climate variabilities and climate extremes may be a consequence of an on-going climate change and would thus result in a more permanent change in the pre-conditions for food production. The presentations and discussion during the workshop concentrated on some different measures to be taken in addressing these kind of situations and in particularly on the adverse effects of dry spells, droughts and to some extent also floods. The different areas presented were examples from Bangladesh, the Indus river and delta region, examples from India (Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh), Israel, Sri Lanka and Uzbekistan. © SIWI 2004.",Not About Sufficiency
Enhancing rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge efficiency with multi-dimensional LSTM and clonal selection algorithm,"Rainwater harvesting stands out as a promising solution to alleviate water scarcity and alleviate pressure on conventional water reservoirs. This work introduces a pioneering strategy to elevate the efficiency of rainwater harvesting systems through the fusion of Multi-Dimensional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA). The Multi-Dimensional LSTM networks serve to model intricate temporal and spatial rainfall patterns, enabling precise predictions regarding the optimal times and locations for rainwater abundance. This insight is pivotal in refining the design and operation of rainwater harvesting setups. Drawing inspiration from the immune system, the Clonal Selection Algorithm is employed to optimize site selection and resource allocation, ensuring the maximal utilization of harvested rainwater. The adaptability and robustness of CSA prove invaluable in tackling the dynamic nature of rainfall patterns. This research endeavor is dedicated to enhancing groundwater levels and optimizing its sources through the implementation of efficient harvesting techniques. By delving into innovative methodologies, it aims to contribute significantly to sustainable water management practices and ensure a reliable supply of groundwater for various societal needs. The experiments are conducted to study the effectiveness of rainwater harvesting systems, where the proposed method achieves increased efficiency, thereby reducing dependence on conventional water sources and contributing to sustainable water management practices. The proposed CSA-LSTM model demonstrates superior performance compared to ACO-ANN and PSO-BPNN, achieving higher training, testing, and validation accuracies while exhibiting lower training, testing, and validation losses. Additionally, CSA-LSTM showcases excellent site suitability, high resource utilization, and robustness to changes, with a fast response time, emphasizing its potential for efficient and effective applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of future agricultural change on ecosystem service indicators,"A future of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, changing climate, growing human populations, and shifting socioeconomic conditions means that the global agricultural system will need to adapt in order to feed the world. These changes will affect not only agricultural land but terrestrial ecosystems in general. Here, we use the coupled land use and vegetation model LandSyMM (Land System Modular Model) to quantify future land use change (LUC) and resulting impacts on ecosystem service indicators relating to carbon sequestration, runoff, biodiversity, and nitrogen pollution. We additionally hold certain variables, such as climate or land use, constant to assess the relative contribution of different drivers to the projected impacts. Some ecosystem services depend critically on land use and management: for example, carbon storage, the gain in which is more than 2.5 times higher in a low-LUC scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 4 and Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0; SSP4-60) than a high-LUC one with the same carbon dioxide and climate trajectory (SSP3-60). Other trends are mostly dominated by the direct effects of climate change and carbon dioxide increase. For example, in those two scenarios, extreme high monthly runoff increases across 54% and 53% of land, respectively, with a mean increase of 23% in both. Scenarios in which climate change mitigation is more difficult (SSPs 3 and 5) have the strongest impacts on ecosystem service indicators, such as a loss of 13%-19% of land in biodiversity hotspots and a 28% increase in nitrogen pollution. Evaluating a suite of ecosystem service indicators across scenarios enables the identification of tradeoffs and co-benefits associated with different climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies and socioeconomic developments. © 2020 Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Unveiling Environmental Crime Trends and Intensity in the EU Countries Through a Sustainability Lens,"Environmental crime poses a significant threat to global ecosystems, biodiversity, and human well-being, encompassing activities such as pollution, illegal waste disposal, trade in protected species, and natural resource degradation. Understanding the dynamics of these crimes is essential for devising effective mitigation strategies and promoting sustainability at micro, meso, and macro level. The aim of the study is to examine environmental crimes in the EU, focusing on their current trends, patterns, and Intensity, as well as the impact on sustainability across its three dimensions. Fourteen EU countries environmental crime data from 2016 to 2021were analysed to reveal variations and trends. Geographic information systems (GIS) utilized to identify countries with elevated environmental crime rates, emphasizing the need for interventions in pollution control, waste management, and resource conservation. Results indicate high environmental pollution intensity in Italy, Sweden, and Denmark. Moreover, Italy emerges as the epicentre of illegal waste dumping, with notable cases also present in Belgium and France. Additionally, France, Slovakia, and Italy show alarming levels of illegal wildlife trade. Furthermore, France and Sweden exhibit the highest density of natural resource degradation cases. In addition, the study unveiled a positive correlation () between environmental pollution, trade in protected species, and natural resource degradation with population growth, while waste disposal exhibited a negative correlation (). Moreover, trade in protected species and resource degradation correlated negatively () with the poverty ratio. Addressing environmental crimes aligns with the pursuit of green justice, recognizing the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and economic factors. The findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, environmentalists, and communities, guiding interventions towards a sustainable and resilient future. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Adapting agriculture to climate shifts: managing crop water needs for environmental resilience in Sindh, Pakistan","Sindh is an important hub for the agricultural production in Pakistan. Therefore, this study was aimed to model the air temperature trend in Sindh and its impacts on the seasonal water requirement for Rice, Wheat, and Sugarcane under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. In this study, RegCM4 with GFDL-ESM2M was used and the bias correction of RegCM4 simulations was done using Quantile Mapping. As per the analysis, the average annual temperature over the study area may rise by about 1.2 to 1.8 °C and 2.8 to 3.3 °C under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios respectively. Seasonally, warming is expected to be higher in spring and winter seasons, whereas, diurnally, the daytime temperature may increase by about 1.2 to 1.7 °C and 2.6 to 3.2 °C, while the nighttime temperature may rise by about 1.4 to 2.7 °C and 3.0 to 3.5 °C under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios respectively. Consequentially, the seasonal water requirement for Rice in Sindh may increase by about 50–100 mm and 100–200 mm under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios respectively. For Wheat, the water requirement may rise by about 60 mm and 100 mm, whereas for Sugarcane, it may soar by about 100–150 mm and 150–200 mm under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios respectively. Conclusively, the rising crop water consumption may cause increased irrigation requirements, low crop water productivity and yield, and rising local water disputes thereby endangering the crop production and water security in the province. © 2024, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

"The nexus of geopolitics, decarbonization, and food security gives rise to distinct challenges across fertilizer supply chains","Fertilizers are essential for agricultural production and vital to global food security. Nevertheless, the production and use of fertilizers, primarily the nitrogen type, contribute substantially to global greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, fertilizer markets are closely intertwined with a changing geopolitical landscape and disruptions induced by the war in Ukraine. Despite a growing number of studies that have explored these various dimensions of fertilizers, the intricate interdependencies across these different variables along global fertilizer supply chains remain insufficiently examined. Adopting a nexus perspective, this review unravels a reshaping of the global fertilizer landscape led by intertwined driving forces, namely the mounting quest for a more secure supply of fertilizers, efforts to decarbonize production with local renewable energy feedstocks, and the pursuit of industrial upgrading and geopolitical goals. The intertwined nature of these trends, this review argues, warrants a distinct agenda of nexus-based research to dissolve socio-political and environmental conundrums for more sustainable global fertilizer supply chains. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Crop yields response to water pressures in the Ebro basin in Spain: Risk and water policy implications,"The increasing pressure on water systems in the Mediterranean enhances existing water conflicts and threatens water supply for agriculture. In this context, one of the main priorities for agricultural research and public policy is the adaptation of crop yields to water pressures. This paper focuses on the evaluation of hydrological risk and water policy implications for food production. Our methodological approach includes four steps. For the first step, we estimate the impacts of rainfall and irrigation water on crop yields. However, this study is not limited to general crop production functions since it also considers the linkages between those economic and biophysical aspects which may have an important effect on crop productivity. We use statistical models of yield response to address how hydrological variables affect the yield of the main Mediterranean crops in the Ebro river basin. In the second step, this study takes into consideration the effects of those interactions and analyzes gross value added sensitivity to crop production changes. We then use Montecarlo simulations to characterize crop yield risk to water variability. Finally we evaluate some policy scenarios with irrigated area adjustments that could cope in a context of increased water scarcity. A substantial decrease in irrigated land, of up to 30% of total, results in only moderate losses of crop productivity. The response is crop and region specific and may serve to prioritise adaptation strategies. © Author(s) 2011.",Not About Sufficiency
Costa Rica's national strategy for sustainable development: A summary,"The Costa Rican National Conservation Strategy for Sustainable Development (ECODES) is an official programme of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mines within the Costa Rican government. It began as a conservation strategy but has been greatly enlarged in both methodology and scope. ECODES integrates many of the sectors typically found in national 21st century studies, including economics, urbanization, agriculture, water resources, demography, industry, mining, tourism, energy, and science and technology. The programme began with the identification of national objectives and then proceeded to the identification of specific policies which the nation must adopt if it is to reach those objectives. In the programme, sustainable development is seen not just as an integration of environment and economics, but as the search for a whole way of life based on individual and group responsibility, social justice, and peaceful civil and international relations. © 1990.",Not About Sufficiency
Judicial Innovation in Enhancing Forest Carbon Sinks: Evidence from China,"Sustainable forest management plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation and adaption, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Recognizing the significance of sustainable forest management, China has implemented a range of the legislative measures and policies for the conservation and restoration of key forest ecosystems and has launched the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program and other key forest programs, resulting in an increase in forest coverage and forest carbon sinks. In addition to forestry ecological restoration projects (FERPs) initiated by the administration and project developers, the Chinese courts have also actively engaged in exploring various strategies to enhance forest carbon sinks. In both criminal and civil cases, afforestation and reforestation activities, buying forest carbon credits, and participation in forest management and other restoration activities by offenders have been regarded as factors in determining legal responsibility. Moreover, the courts have also established forest restoration centers, either independently or in collaboration with local governments. These judicial innovations in China have provided positive incentives for the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of forests, thereby significantly contributing to the achievement of the Climate Action Goals (SDG 13). However, these developments also raise several concerns, particularly the fair application of forest carbon sink mechanisms, the comparability in ecosystem service between damaged natural resources and compensatory measures, and the interconnection of the various SDGs. It is imperative to establish clear guidance on buying forest carbon credits, to develop standards and procedures to assess forest carbon sinks, and to strengthen cooperation between the judiciary and governmental agencies. Additionally, it is essential to integrate the forest carbon sink with broad economic development goals and social justice frameworks to ensure sustainable and inclusive outcomes. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Vegetation dynamics in response to climate change from the wetlands of Western Himalaya, India: Holocene Indian summer monsoon variability","India’s agricultural output, economy and societal well-being are strappingly dependent on the stability of the southwest summer monsoon precipitation, its variability and extremes. Deviations in the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) precipitation may profoundly impact the agricultural productivity and gross domestic product (GDP) of the country. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ISM precipitation during the Holocene is significant in many respects, particularly in terms of human development and establishment of centres of civilisations. Here, pollen records of the variability in ISM precipitation and their interpretation in terms of vegetation and climate change from two wetlands (Gharana and Nanga; Ramsar sites) of the Western Himalaya (India) is presented. The results suggest that between ~8536 and 5296 cal yr BP, mixed conifer/broad-leaved forests occurred in the Jammu region (Gharana Wetland sediment profile) under a cool and dry climate, probably indicating decreased monsoon precipitation. Subsequently, they were succeeded by mixed broad-leaved/conifer forests between ~5296 and 2776 cal yr BP under a warm and humid climate with increased monsoon precipitation, partly corresponding to the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO). Between ~2776 and 1376 cal yr BP, with more expansion of broad-leaved forest elements in response to a warm and more humid climate the dense mixed broad-leaved/conifer forests came into existence in the region, indicating a further increase in monsoon precipitation. From ~1376 cal yr BP to present, the climate deteriorated, as manifested by the replacement of dense mixed broad-leaved/conifer forests by mixed conifer/broad-leaved forests in the region. The palaeoclimatic inferences drawn from the Nanga Wetland sediment profile of Samba District match with the Gharana Wetland sediment profile of Jammu District for the late-Holocene. This study provides insights into the vegetation dynamics, associated climate change and the ISM variability from the poorly understood wetland ecosystems of Southeast Asia during the Holocene. © The Author(s) 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
A Modified Self-adaptive Method for Mapping Annual 30-m Land Use/Land Cover Using Google Earth Engine: A Case Study of Yangtze River Delta,"Annual Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change information at medium spatial resolution (i.e., at 30 m) is used in applications ranging from land management to achieving sustainable development goals related to food security. However, obtaining annual LULC information over large areas and long periods is challenging due to limitations on computational capabilities, training data, and workflow design. Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE), which provides a catalog of multi-source data and a cloud-based environment, we developed a novel methodology to generate a high accuracy 30-m LULC cover map collection of the Yangtze River Delta by integrating free and public LULC products with Landsat imagery. Our major contribution is a hybrid approach that includes three major components: 1) a high-quality training dataset derived from multi-source LULC products, filtered by k-means clustering analysis; 2) a yearly 39-band stack feature space, utilizing all available Landsat data and DEM data; and 3) a self-adaptive Random Forest (RF) method, introduced for LULC classification. Experimental results show that our proposed workflow achieves an average classification accuracy of 86.33% in the entire Delta. The results demonstrate the great potential of integrating multi-source LULC products for producing LULC maps of increased reliability. In addition, as the proposed workflow is based on open source data and the GEE cloud platform, it can be used anywhere by anyone in the world. © 2021, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"Effects of private car ownership, economic growth and medical services on healthcare expenditure in China: a dynamic panel data analysis","Vehicle exhaust emissions are identified as one of the main determinants of air pollution and play an important role in the environmental sustainable improvement of countries. This research utilizes a panel data of 30 Chinese provinces during the period between 1997 and 2012 to examine the existence of inverted U-shaped relationship between public healthcare expenditure per capita and private car ownership across geographical regions (east, middle and west China) employing panel generalized method of moments estimates for robust estimates. The findings also show the income per capita significantly and positively impacts on health expenditure per capita at the national level. The other results indicate that sulfur dioxide emissions and people over age 65 significantly increase healthcare expenditure per capita except the western region; soot emissions have a significantly positive impact on public health expenditure per capita for only the whole country and the western region; the number of doctors per capita may decrease public health expenditure per capita caused by environmental pollution. These results have important policy implications for promotion of new energy vehicles and for improving air quality and medical and health services. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantification of cultivar change in double rice regions under a warming climate during 1981–2009 in China,"Maintaining high double rice productivity in China is very important for ensuring the food security of China. However, the double rice production system is sensitive to changes in both climate and management practices. Previous studies showed that rice production has been negatively impacted by global warming without considering the changes of cultivars and management practices. However, cultivar improvements and the impact of cultivar change must not be ignored in any assessment. In the current study, we combined data analysis with crop modeling to investigate the impacts of changes in climate and cultivars on rice productivity at three different double rice sites (Nanchang, Hengyang, and Gaoyao) in China. The results showed a warming trend at the study sites during 1981–2009, and the temperature increase rates (maximum, average, and minimum temperatures) in the late rice growing season were larger than in the early rice growing season. Global warming has led to a reduction in the length of the rice growth period. Adopting new rice cultivars may partially mitigate the declining trend of the growing duration and grain yield, but it would not completely compensate for the negative impact observed in double rice regions. In general, the changes in cultivars prolonged the growing duration by increasing the basic vegetative phase and the photoperiod formation phase. The main reasons for yield improvement were the increase in the percentage of filled grains for early rice and the increase in grain number per spike for late rice. In the face of future warming, breeding efforts are necessary for producing new cultivars that are resilient to the negative impacts of future climate change on agriculture. © 2019 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Challenges Threatening Agricultural Sustainability in Central Asia: Status and Prospect,"Agriculture provides humanity with the most basic products to sustain life and raw materials for production, closely linking human society and nature together. The sustainable development of agriculture, an inevitable choice to maintain long-term social stability, steady economic growth, and ecological security, is the key to the coordinated development of the economy, society, and environment in developing Central Asia economies. We attempted to evaluate the trend of agricultural sustainability in Central Asia between 2002 and 2017 by adopting analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method in this study. It was found that the overall sustainability level of regional agriculture is rising, which is mainly driven by economic progress, with social and ecological dimensions contributing much less. Accordingly, we advanced four suggestions: enhancing water productivity, optimizing planting techniques, improving agricultural cooperatives, and promoting digital land management to boost the agricultural sustainability of the region. © 2022 by the authors.

Understanding livestock production and sustainability of grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt,"Background: Companioned by economic development, a dietary shift toward higher meat consumption is seen in developing countries and transitional economies, where the demand for livestock production has been increasing in response to such a dietary shift. In the Asian Dryland Belt, approaches to meet this demand have focused on grazing intensification, cropland conversion for animal feed, and supplemental feeding. With the scarcity of water, energy, and food in the region, a key question is whether or not the current approaches are sustainable. If not, what are the pathways to increase livestock production while protecting the region’s environment for a sustainable future? We provide our reviews and discuss current approaches in response to these dietary shifts and assess their environmental resilience with a focus on the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Results: While current approaches alleviate the urgent need for short-term livestock production, they lead to long-term vulnerability in food security. Trade-offs between short gains and long-term losses, between food for humans and for animals, and between agricultural intensification and environmental degradation need to be holistically examined for the sustainable development of the region. A grassland water, energy, and food nexus framework is proposed with specific recommendations to increase livestock production while considering other ecosystem services of the dryland grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt. Conclusions: Current practices to increase livestock production are likely to lead to long-term, large-scale ecological degradation of the grassland ecosystems in the Asian Dryland Belt and are thus unsustainable. By considering the trade-offs in the nexus of water, land, food, and livelihoods, sustainable pathways were articulated and recommended.

The Future of Unconventional Water Resources,"The water scarcity challenge continues to grow and intensify in arid and semi-arid areas. There is a need to build a diversified portfolio of water management strategies to face this challenge. With unconventional water resources as the common theme, the following strategies have the potential to help address global water scarcity: (1) promoting further research and practice on both technical and nontechnical aspects of unconventional water resources; (2) ensuring that unconventional waters provide benefits, not cost to the environment; (3) positioning unconventional waters as a reliable source of water in times of uncertainty; and (4) supporting complementary and multidimensional approaches such as addressing water scarcity and climate change together because most climate change impacts are expressed through water issues. Such a focus on unconventional water resources needs to continue and be supported by on-the-ground projects in water-critical areas to connect water experts, practitioners, young professionals, the private sector, the media, and policymakers to learn and exchange pertinent knowledge and practices. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable ruminant production to help feed the planet,"Ruminant production has been an essential part of human activities worldwide since ancient times. The expected increase in world population and per capita income, with an increase in the amount and prevalence of animal products in human diet, urbanisation, with a concentration of population in urban areas and an increase in losses in the supply chain, and the growing concern over the environmental impact of animal farming require a long-term global strategy for a more intensive and sustainable ruminant production. Therefore, solutions to increase the supply of high-quality products of ruminant origin, without harming human health, animal welfare, and environment, should consider the following interconnected issues discussed in this review: (a) effects of meat, milk and dairy products consumption on human health, focussing on the imbalance caused by their insufficient consumption, and the alleged increased incidence of certain diseases due to their consumption; (b) importance of the sustainable intensification of ruminant production systems (e.g. better feed conversion and higher production output per unit of input introduced into the farming system); (c) environmental impact of ruminant production; (d) improvement of animal performance by improving animal welfare; (e) adaptation of ruminants to climate change; (f) sustainable ruminant feeding (e.g. precision feeding techniques, optimisation of grazing systems, and use of unconventional feeds); (g) challenges posed by production intensification to animal breeding and conservation of animal biodiversity; and (h) strategies to increase ruminant production in developing countries, thus achieving food security in vast areas of the planet affected by fast growth of human population. © 2016 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Contextualizing sustainable forest management and social justice in community-based forest management (CBFM) program in the Philippines,"The Philippines' Community-Based Forest Management (CBFM) Program is the primary strategy for sustainable forest management and social justice in the uplands. The upland communities provided a catalytic role to restore degraded forestlands and protect the remaining forest cover in the country, but unlike the timber license agreement (TLA) concessionaires, they do not have enough assets to fulfill their needs and responsibilities. They are also subjected to restrictive policies beyond their capacity to follow. While numerous works of literature have been written on the successes and failures of different modes of community forestry in Asia and the Pacific for the past two decades, very limited, if any, attention has been given to the role of community welfare as a prerequisite for sustainability and social justice in forestry. Using the data on national CBFM assessment in the Philippines, this paper critically examines the CBFM Program after more than two decades of implementation using the community welfare lens. Thematic analysis of results revealed that in achieving sustainability and social justice in forestry, the following crucial elements should be taken into account: (1) land tenure is a crucial aspect of community welfare but the complexity of social-ecological relations must be taken into account; (2) skewed priority towards biophysical targets undermines the importance of socio-economic needs and considerations in the uplands; and (3) restrictive and conflicting policies significantly diminishes the potential of CBFM for transformative change. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency

Toward a quantification of risks at the nexus of conservation and health: The case of bushmeat markets in Lao PDR,"Trade of bushmeat and other wildlife for human consumption presents a unique set of challenges to policy-makers who are confronted with multiple trade-offs between conservation, food security, food safety, culture and tradition. In the face of these complex issues, risk assessments supported by quantitative information would facilitate evidence-based decision making. We propose a conceptual model for disease transmission risk analysis, inclusive of these multiple other facets. To quantify several processes included in this conceptual model we conducted questionnaire surveys with wildlife consumers and vendors in semi-urban centers in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, Laos) and direct observations of consumer behaviors. Direct observation of market stalls indicated an estimated average of 10 kg bushmeat biomass per stall per hour. The socio-demographic data suggested that consumption of bushmeat in urban areas was not for subsistence but rather driven by dietary preference and tradition. Consumer behavioral observations indicated that each animal receives an average of 7 contacts per hour. We provide other key parameters to estimate the risk of disease transmission from bushmeat consumption and illustrate their use in assessing the total public health and socio-economic impact of bushmeat consumption. Pursuing integrative approaches to the study of bushmeat consumption is essential to develop effective and balanced policies that support conservation, public health, and rural development goals. © 2019",Not About Sufficiency
Collaboration networks for social innovation in the context of social incubators: Constitutive elements,"Social innovation is a concept that arises in a complex environment. Problems related to climate change, the global epidemic of chronic diseases and social inequality are challenges that the current political structure has not treated in an egalitarian approach. Experiences in social innovation point to collaborative work. Several types of players relate to finding solutions to the problems inherent in the less favored population. In this sense, the objective of this article is to identify the constituent elements of the collaboration network, which emerge in the context of social innovation. This is a qualitative and descriptive research, of the case study type, applied in a social incubator. The authors used documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews to collect the data. Based on the thematic analysis of the primary data, it was concluded that the constituent elements of the collaboration network in the context of social incubators are: partnerships (networks of players and types of partnerships); collaboration (mutual aid, commitment and trust); self-management (shared leadership, joint decision-making and shared processes); resources (financial, material and human); learning (training, lecture and sharing of experiences).

Recent contributions of air- and biomarkers to the control of secondhand smoke (SHS): A review,"Since the publication of the US Surgeon General Reports in 1996 and 2006 and the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency in 1999, many reports have appeared on the contribution of air and biomarkers to different facets of the secondhand smoke (SHS) issue, which are the targets of this review. These recent studies have allowed earlier epidemiological surveys to be biologically validated, and their plausibility demonstrated, quantified the levels of exposure to SHS before the bans in various environments, showed the deficiencies of mechanical control methods and of partial bans and the frequently correct implementation of the efficient total bans. More stringent regulation remains necessary in the public domain (workplaces, hospitality venues, transport sector, etc.) in many countries. Personal voluntary protection efforts against SHS are also needed in the private domain (homes, private cars). The effects of SHS on the cardiovascular, respiratory and neuropsychic systems, on pregnancy and fertility, on cancers and on SHS genotoxicity are confirmed through experimental human studies and through the relationship between markers and prevalence of disease or of markers of disease risk. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
The 3D characterisation of the zone of human interaction and the sustainable use of underground space in urban and peri-urban environments: case studies from the UK,"Meeting the challenges of sustainable development and regeneration to support city growth requires the provision of attributed 3D geological and geotechnical data, information and process understanding in the urban subsurface. This provides a 3D framework for the characterisation of the spatial variability of the properties and processes within the shallow subsurface to aid sustainable land use planning and regeneration. The subsurface has to provide the resources and ecosystem services to sustain and create economic growth and meet societal needs, now and in the future while minimising the environmental impact of development. The 3D variability of the ground results from anthropogenic (man-made) processes as well as geological. Human exploitation of the subsurface and rapid land use change in response to population growth and urbanisation, result in temporal and spatial modification of the ground. The integration of 3D geological and anthropogenic deposits models is therefore essential for the characterisation of urban ""zone of human interaction"" and its response to anthropogenic environmental change. Model integration to aid land use planning has been applied in the formerly heavily industrialised cities of NW England and Northern Ireland to provide a basis for linear transport assessment, urban planning and the assessment of aquifer vulnerability. © 2010 E.

Farm resilience to climatic risk. A review,"Increasing our understanding of farm resilience drivers to climate-related risks is critical for designing innovative farm systems, especially for smallholders that are highly vulnerable to climatic hazards and expected to follow a pathway toward sustainable development. However, the literature is fragmented on the concepts and methods to measure farm resilience. Moreover, quantitative assessments of options to enhance farm resilience to climate risks are scarce. Resilience can be defined as the ability of a system to recover, reorganize and evolve following external stresses and disturbances. Such definition can be applied to farm systems. In this study, we systematically reviewed how changes in resilience-enhancing attributes (reserves, openness, modularity, tightness of feedbacks and diversity) impacted farm performance and resilience to climate-related risks, with a specific attention to smallholder farms. Our analysis showed that reviewed studies assessed farm resilience using the agricultural and economic dimensions of performance, often excluding the socio-environmental dimensions. To assess performance, the average value of indicators was most commonly employed, sometimes combined with variability metrics or the probability of exceeding a critical threshold. Improving one resilience attribute increased one dimension of farm performance for a given metric in most of the studies, but some studies showed the opposite effect. The lack of comprehensive assessments exploring different attributes and their impact on several dimensions of performance using diverse metrics prevents a robust conclusion on how to improve farm resilience to climate-related risks. Therefore, we recommend to pay more attention to quantitative assessments of farm resilience, including a systematic investigation of the temporal variability of performance and the socio-environmental dimensions of performance. Finally, we emphasize the need to focus on the recovery of smallholder farms after a disturbance, with the goal of achieving growth in farm performance rather than simply reverting to their current state of food insecurity and poverty. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of climate change on agricultural productivity in Romania. A country-scale assessment based on the relationship between climatic water balance and maize yields in recent decades,"The impact of climate change on agricultural systems has become a reality that currently threatens food security in numerous regions worldwide. However, concrete consequences of climate change on agricultural yields still remain unknown in many countries around the world, including Romania. This study conducts a first-ever analysis of the impact of climate change on maize productivity in Romania, the European Union's leader in maize harvested production, which holds almost 30% of the European maize production. The paper explores complex statistical relationships between the climatic water balance (CWB)/its constituting parameters precipitation (P) and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and maize yields (Zea mays L.) recorded nationally from 1990 to 2013, a key-period in Romania in terms of climate and socio-political changes. The analysis of various agro-climatic data, based on well-established methods (linear regression and bootstrapping), showed that the countrywide dependence of maize yields variability to changes in the analyzed climatic variables was considerable and reached peak values of roughly 60% for the CWB-yield relationship and around 50% for the P-yield and ETo-yield relationships. At the same time, a significant sensitivity of maize yield dynamics was found in response to a 1-unit climate change, which, on average, was quantified at 5 kg/ha/yr for a 1-mm variation of the CWB, and at 19 kg/ha/yr and 11 kg/ha/yr for a 1-mm change in P and ETo, respectively. In addition to this agricultural impact, our findings regarding the economic impact associated to concrete climatic trends (CWB decreases and ETo increases over the 24 years, consistent with an overall increase of the humidity deficit, and P increases, consistent with humidity surplus) indicate total costs of approximately 53 mil € (or almost 1% of the national agricultural gross domestic product) for the CWB-yield relationship, and of ~200 mil € (~3%) for ETo-yield. It was found that the separate influence of P in maize dynamics was positive, with net financial gains of up to ~130 mil € (~2%). However, our findings show that only the economic costs associated with the impact of ETo on maize productivity are highly statistically reliable. Our results issue a warning about the urgent measures to fight climate change effects on agriculture in Romania, which are necessary especially in the counties located in the Extra-Carpathian regions, highly vulnerable to climate dynamics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Assessing the sustainability of agriculture: A case of Mae Chaem Catchment, northern Thailand","Sustainability is not a new concept but rather a prominent concept at the present time. Researchers have categorized sustainability indicators into economic, social, and ecological aspects. Sustainability of agriculture in the context of development efforts has to meet production efficiency, resilience of ecosystems, appropriate technology, maintenance of the environment, cultural diversity, and satisfaction of the basic needs. The research objective of this study is to determine the critical indicators of agricultural sustainability in the Mae Chaem Catchment, northern Thailand. In assessing sustainability, the authors applied the sustainability indicator analysis developed by FAO. The results of the study show that food sufficiency in the Wat Chan subcatchment is the most sustainable aspect of agriculture. The least sustainable facets of agriculture in the Wat Chan subcatchment are land holding size, land tenure, and water shortage. While expansion of agricultural land in the watershed area is not legally permitted, a practice of agroforestry is recommended. Insecure land tenure may result in reduced incentives to improve land productivity. Thus, official recognition of land ownership is required. As the problem of water shortage is most critical in the lower reaches, increased participation in the allocation scheme by downstream villagers should be encouraged. Finally, the construction of a small-scale water storage in the lower part of the catchment to increase water supply should be considered. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The knowledge economy,"We define the knowledge economy as production and services based on knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technical and scientific advance, as well as rapid obsolescence. The key component of a knowledge economy is a greater reliance on intellectual capabilities than on physical inputs or natural resources. We provide evidence drawn from patent data to document an upsurge in knowledge production and show that this expansion is driven by the emergence of new industries. We then review the contentious literature that assesses whether recent technological advances have raised productivity. We examine the debate over whether new forms of work that embody technological change have generated more worker autonomy or greater managerial control. Finally, we assess the distributional consequences of a knowledge-based economy with respect to growing inequality in wages and high-quality jobs.",Not About Sufficiency
Russia: Austerity and deficit reduction in historical and comparative perspective,"This paper looks at Russian experience with austerity programmes since the breakdown of the former Soviet Union in 1991. Downsizing of the state was one of the major elements in a reform package designed to transform the centrally planned economy into a market one (together with deregulation, privatisation, macroeconomic stabilisation and the opening up of the closed economy). This downsizing, however, proved to be the single most important reason for the collapse of state institutions, which in turn deepened the transformational recession, contributed to the dramatic rise of income inequalities, corruption and crime, and the decline in life expectancy. The story of the successes and failures of transition is not really the story of consistent shock therapy and inconsistent gradualism. The major plot of the postsocialist transformation 'novel' is the preservation of strong institutions in some countries (very different in other respects-from Central Europe and Estonia to China, Uzbekistan and Belarus) and the collapse of these institutions in other countries. At least 90% of this story is about government failure (the strength of state institutions) and not about market failure (liberalisation).The Author 2012.

"Agricultural sciences and the environment: Reviewing recent technologies and innovations to combat the challenges of climate change, environmental protection, and food security","Agricultural production systems currently face multiple challenges: Climate change, natural resource depletion, and supply chain disruption, together with global population growth. As sustainable agriculture must simultaneously deliver myriad services (e.g. provide food security, maintain natural resources, retain and improve framers’ profitability, and sustain biodiversity), a systemic and multidisciplinary approach is thus needed. In this context, new technologies based on sensors, automatic machines, robots, and digital applications show much potential. The special section of the Agronomy Journal, entitled, “Agricultural and Biological Sciences: Plant, Soil, Animal and Environment Nutrient Management,” brings together a coherent set of research studies. All papers published in this special section address current, relevant topics for agriculture, biology and environmental sciences with a multidisciplinary approach aimed at generating new scientific information on digital technologies, bioinformatics, plant science, soil resources, agricultural waste, and environmentally conscious approaches. A total of 58 papers were submitted, each of which was evaluated by expert reviewers using a double-blind reviewing process and 25 full text papers were accepted for publication in the special section. The present paper highlights the findings of the published papers, with the aim of bringing cutting-edge innovation to applied research in agriculture and biology. The published papers here provide new knowledge and viable solutions for better performance in agricultural and biological sciences. New technologies will change the concept of farming and agribusiness making it more profitable, efficient, safer, attractive, simple, smart, and finally sustainable. Rural development and food security policies must support and finance the easiest possible access to new technologies for agricultural producers. © 2022 The Authors.

Examining the environmental impacts of the dairy and baby food industries: Are first-food systems a crucial missing part of the healthy and sustainable food systems agenda now underway?,"Food systems are increasingly being understood as driving various health and ecological crises and their transformation is recognised as a key opportunity for planetary health. First-food systems represent an underexplored aspect of this transformation. Despite breastfeeding representing the optimal source of infant nutrition, use of commercial milk formula (CMF) is high and growing rapidly. In this review, we examine the impact of CMF use on planetary health, considering in particular its effects on climate change, water use and pollution and the consequences of these effects for human health. Milk is the main ingredient in the production of CMF, making the role of the dairy sector a key area of attention. We find that CMF use has twice the carbon footprint of breastfeeding, while 1 kg of CMF has a blue water footprint of 699 L; CMF has a significant and harmful environmental impact. Facilitation and protection of breastfeeding represents a key part of developing sustainable first-food systems and has huge potential benefits for maternal and child health. © 2021 by the authors.

"Rainfall shocks, child mortality, and water infrastructure","I study the effect of rainfall shocks on child mortality at a sub-national level for a global set of developing countries. I establish that negative (positive) shocks to rainfall lead to an increase (drop) in child deaths overall. Low-income countries (LICs) and the group of countries reliant on agriculture are affected the most due to negative rainfall shocks. In LICs, the impact of negative rainfall shocks is mitigated by around 60% in districts located downstream to dams, an effect predominant among less affluent districts; in addition, the effect of rainfall fluctuations is persistent, lasting for up to three years following the shock. Results remain robust to the inclusion of relevant controls, to the consideration of relevant issues such as selective fertility and migration, and various other robustness tests. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Social acceptance of renewable energy: Some examples from Europe and developing Africa,"Current energy systems are in most instances not fully working sustainably. The provision and use of energy only consider limited resources, risk potential or financial constraints on a limited scale. Furthermore, the knowledge and benefits are only available for a minor group of the population or are outright neglected. The availability of different resources for energy purposes determines economic development, as well as the status of the society and the environment. The access to energy grids has an impact on socio-economic living standards of communities. This not fully developed system is causing climate change with all its related outcomes. This investigation takes into consideration different views on renewable energy systems-such as international discussions about biomass use for energy production, ""fuel versus food"", biogas use-and attempts to compare major prospects of social acceptance of renewable energy in Europe and Africa. Can all obstacles to the use of renewable energy be so profound that the overall strategy of reducing anthropogenic causes of climate change be seriously affected?",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability-risk-resilience: How does the case of the good agricultural and environmental conditions measure up?,"Farmers are challenged to reconcile the demand for environmental goods, food security, and the viability of rural societies, by negotiating price volatility, land use drivers, climate change, and demographic issues. Alongside such challenges, a new, widely discussed concept of farm resilience has emerged. The triangle of sustainability, resilience, and risk enables the basis to be set for a conceptual framework of Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC). Herewith, it is demonstrated how the proportions of this triangle change; reasons for the implementation of GAEC as sustainability standards for EU farms are analysed. Firstly, ways in which its principles have evolved over the past two and a half decades are investigated. The question of whether and how the GAEC framework reflects its own starting points linked to sustainability, risk, and resilience is also examined. These have evolved into something different, due to success having created new economic actors, seeking more complex, open economic, and political institutions than those provided by a state-centric model of development. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Indoor temperature variability in the Sahel: a pilot study in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso","Abstract: Very little research has documented the exposure of populations in Africa to extreme heat. We measured indoor air temperature and humidity hourly for 13 months in seven houses of contrasted architecture and construction materials all in the northern neighbourhoods of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. These measurements are compared to air temperatures recorded at the synoptic weather station of Ouagadougou airport and to land surface temperature estimates from Landsat satellite images at seven dates with clear-sky conditions. The results reveal huge temperature differences (exceeding 10 °C) between houses, especially in the afternoon hours of the warmest season. Indoor temperature is also much more variable than land surface (outdoor) temperature in the same locations, as estimated by satellite imagery. Houses with greater thermal inertia smooth the afternoon temperature peak, reducing heat exposure. Heat stress bioindicators reveal that danger thresholds, while rarely reached in some houses, are frequently exceeded in others year round except for the core of the cold winter season (December and January). In spring, the hottest season, the danger threshold is almost permanently exceeded in these dwellings, exposing their inhabitants to significant heat stress. This pilot study shows the primary role of housing in modulating indoor temperature, raising questions of public health and habitability of Sahelian regions in a warming world. This issue will be of increasing importance with ongoing climate change, hence the need for further, more detailed instrumented campaigns in African settlements. Highlights: 1. Indoor temperatures vary tremendously between houses. 2. Contrasts between houses are greatest in the hottest hours of the warm season. 3. Thermal danger or extreme danger levels are often exceeded in some houses. 4. In some houses, heat stress may occur in all seasons except winter. 5. More instrumented campaigns for heat stress in African housing are needed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the Sustainability Impact of Land Management with the Ecosystem Services Concept: Towards a Framework for Mediterranean Agroforestry Landscapes,"The concept of sustainability is used to estimate the state and potential of an area or an activity to achieve ‘sustainable development’. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) operationalizes sustainability from a human-centred ecosystems perspective, with indirect driving forces (e.g. population, technologies, and lifestyles) translating into direct drivers (e.g. land use changes) that put pressure on ecosystem services, which directly affect human well-being. All interactions act at different scales, from the local to the global. Ecosystem services, ‘the benefits people obtain from ecosystems’ (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2003: 53), are the core of the framework, grouped into 21 single services within four broad categories of provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. The MA puts a special focus on the identification of trade-offs and synergies between different ecosystem services that depend on specific management practices in an ecosystem. © 2011 Zoran Roca, Paul Claval and John Agnew.",Not About Sufficiency
"Equity, externalities and energy subsidies The case of kerosine in Indonesia","This paper examines two arguments used to justify the subsidy provided kerosine, the primary commercial fuel of Indonesian households. One argument holds that the subsidy reduces deforestation externalities resulting from wood gathering. Econometric analysis of a large cross-section of households finds that firewood/kerosene substitution is very limited in Java, where the deforestation problem is most severe, so that kerosene subsidy is not an effective means of alleviating the problem. The second argument holds that social equity requires the subsidization of 'basic needs' such as kerosene. It is found that the kerosene subsidy disproportionately benefits urban and wealthier households. © 1985.",Not About Sufficiency
Biodiversity research still falls short of creating links with ecosystem services and human well-being in a global hotspot,"Understanding the links between biodiversity, ecosystem services (ES) and human well-being (HWB) is a prerequisite for furthering the agenda of several multilateral environmental agreements and global goals. We performed a systematic review to discuss the extent to which biodiversity research has addressed the interface between ES and HWB and we focused on Brazil as a case study of global relevance. We found that biodiversity research in Brazil remains focused predominantly on biological processes and that research on the links with ES and HWB is in its early phases, exhibiting scarce connections with provisioning and cultural services. This pattern reveals the nature of existing funding policies and scientific gaps in the country. Given the global relevance of Brazil's stock of biodiversity and ES, we argue that research on their links with HWB will be a crucial element of the national and global process of achieving Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. © 2018",Not About Sufficiency
Trends in global greywater reuse: A bibliometric analysis,"The increase in water demand in recent years led to the expansion of research and public policies on the reuse of water, especially greywater (GW). Given the diversity of research in the area, this paper proposes an analysis of the evolution of the area through an objectivity metric. Metadata of 1,524 publications indexed in the Scopus database between 1974 and 2021 were analyzed using the VOSviewer tool, and showed exponential growth in publications from 2013. Six different spelling variations were found for GW in the database. Despite the highly geographical scattering of academic production, developed countries, who began researching greywater earlier, had more connections and published more papers; except for Israel, which had the highest average of citations per article. While developed countries lead the research area, developing countries are emerging in GW reuse research. These aspects reveal both the dispersion of the research structure development and a trend of intellectual production in GW from developed to developing countries. Also, we noted that countries suffering from water scarcity stood out with the highest activity in paper publishing. Thus, we expect that future research on GW reuse will take place in developing countries that face water scarcity. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Linking biodiversity indicators, ecosystem functioning, provision of services and human well-being in estuarine systems: Application of a conceptual framework","Assuming that human well-being strongly relies on the services provided by well-functioning ecosystems, changes in the ecological functioning of any system can have direct and indirect effects on human welfare. Intensive land use and tourism have expanded in recent decades along coastal ecosystems, together with increasing demands for water, food and energy; all of these factors intensify the exploitation of natural resources. Many of the interrelations between ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services (ES) still require quantification in estuarine systems. A conceptual framework to assess such links in a spatially and temporally explicit manner is proposed and applied to the Mondego estuary (Portugal). This framework relies on three consecutive steps and discriminates among biodiversity structural components, ecosystem functioning and stability and the services provided by the ecosystem. Disturbances in abiotic factors were found to have a direct effect on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and the provision of ES. The observed changes in the species composition of communities had a positive effect on the ecosystem's productivity and stability. Moreover, the observed changes in the estuarine ES provision are likely to arise from changing structural and abiotic factors and in the present case from the loss or decline of locally abundant species. This study also indicates that linear relationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services provision are unlikely to occur in estuarine systems. Instead, cumulative and complex relations are observed between factors on both temporal and spatial scales. In this context, the results suggest several additional conclusions: (1) biodiversity and ecosystem functioning interaction with human well-being need to be incorporated into decision-making processes aimed at the conservative management of systems; (2) the institutional use of research results must be part of the design and implementation of sustainable management activities; and (3) more integrative tools/studies are required to account for the interactions of estuarine ecosystems with surrounding socio-economic activities. Therefore, when performing integrated assessments of ecosystem dynamics, it becomes essential to consider not only the effects of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning on services provision but also the effects that human well-being and ES provision may have on estuarine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The proposed framework implies taking into account both the functional and the commodities points of view upon natural ecosystems and by this representing a line of thought which will deserve further research to explore more in detail the conceptual links between biodiversity-ecosystem functioning-services provided. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Peasants’ struggle for land in China,"Tens of millions of Chinese peasants have been affected by the loss of their land in the past two decades (Gilboy and Heginbotham 2004: 258; Forbes News Agency 2006; Radio Free Asia 21 March 2007; China Daily 23 January 2008). This has given rise to many disputes, often culminating in physical resistance to land takings and evictions (Radio Free Asia 17 October 2007). Wrongful takings have been among the factors preventing the development of a sound law on land tenure and property rights. If these disputes are not handled well, the resulting protests may ultimately lead to major social and political upheaval. The principal cause of land grabbing is China’s rapid urbanization, estimated to see the migration of hundreds of millions more people into urban areas within the next few decades, perhaps 850 million in the next 25 years (Jiang 2006). In 2006, almost 770 square kilometers of land were being built on annually, a figure that was increasing by almost 6% annually (Jiang 2006). While this process sometimes involves unnecessary or irrational construction, for instance in cases in which construction projects are ill-executed, wasteful of natural resources or environmentally harmful (Jiang 2006), urbanization itself is unstoppable. Nor is it necessarily bad for peasants. But many peasant grievances result from the wrongs done in the context of the takings processes. Peasants are denied equal legal status with urban residents. Their individual legal rights in the land are weak, and there are virtually no legal protections against the government taking the land “in the public interest” from the larger collectives to which the peasants belong. In many cases, peasants fail to get the compensation due to them, and in other cases, the government’s interpretation of what is due according to current law is far less than they ought to get. Viewed as a group, peasants are denied equal opportunities to participate in a growing Chinese market economy, and they are also denied equal access to public services. Yet much economic growth could not have happened without trade in, and use of, what was once rural land and the basis of their livelihood. Many rural citizens feel victimized and aggrieved, because they do not want to give up their land, or because they want a share in the profits from property development and urbanization. There are reports suggesting that increasingly, peasants express a sense of ownership in the land, which is only imperfectly reflected in the current law. This paper provides a brief overview of China’s land rights and land tenure system, and of the legal status of its peasants today. It describes how expropriations happen in rural China, and avenues of redress and forms of protest and resistance chosen by the peasants in such cases. Various attempts to circumvent restraining legal rules and allow for an “informal” acquisition of property directly from peasant communities are discussed later. The last part addresses instances of open defiance of legal rules that disadvantage peasants.

The Impact of Village Savings and Loan Associations as a Financial and Climate Resilience Strategy for Mitigating Food Insecurity in Northern Ghana,"In semi-arid Northern Ghana, smallholder farmers face food insecurity and financial risk due to climate change. In response, the Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) model, a community-led microfinance model, has emerged as a promising finance and climate resilience strategy. VSLAs offer savings, loans, and other financial services to help smallholder farmers cope with climate risks. In northern Ghana, where formal financial banking is limited, VSLAs serve as vital financial resources for smallholder farmers. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how VSLAs can bridge financial inclusion and climate resilience strategies to address food insecurity. From a sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) perspective, we utilized data from a cross-sectional survey of 517 smallholder farmers in northern Ghana’s Upper West Region to investigate how VSLAs relate to food insecurity. Results from an ordered logistic regression show that households with membership in a VSLA were less likely to experience severe food insecurity (OR = 0.437, p < 0.01). In addition, households that reported good resilience, owned land, had higher wealth, were female-headed, and made financial decisions jointly were less likely to experience severe food insecurity. Also, spending time accessing the market increases the risk of severe food insecurity. Despite the challenges of the VSLA model, these findings highlight VSLAs’ potential to mitigate food insecurity and serve as a financially resilient and climate-resilient strategy in resource-poor contexts like the UWR and similar areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. VSLAs could contribute to achieving SDG2, zero hunger, and SDG13, climate action. However, policy interventions are necessary to support and scale VSLAs as a sustainable development and food security strategy in vulnerable regions. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Navigating the path to human well-being amidst climate change in Asian countries,"This study advances the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, specifically focusing on Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and Goal 13 (Climate Action). This study uses novel analytical techniques that consider cross-sectional dependencies, intra-cluster correlation, endogeneity, and parameter heterogeneity to explore the relationship between climate change and human well-being in Asian countries from 1990Q1 to 2019Q4. Our empirical results show three things. First, an inverse relationship exists between temperature and human well-being in Asian countries. Second, we observe a robust positive impact of rainfall on human well-being in Asian countries. Lastly, there is a one-way causal effect from rainfall to human well-being and a two-way causal relationship between temperature and human well-being. Our robust results, therefore, suggest that developing comprehensive economic plans to promote public welfare can create a positive feedback loop where enhanced well-being drives greater economic engagement and prosperity. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"The status, obstacles and policy recommendations of shale gas development in china","The Chinese government has introduced numerous policies and development plans to boost its shale gas industry in recent years. However, China's shale gas exploration and development is still in the initial stage and has been confronted with many challenges. This paper systematically analyzes the current status of China's shale gas industry from five aspects for the first time-resource situation, exploration and development status, policy and planning situation, technology status and international cooperation-then respectively elaborates on the different obstacles of shale gas development in the short run and the medium and long term. We argue that short-term barriers to the Chinese shale gas industry mainly include objective factors, such as geological and surface conditions, shale gas proven reserves, technology innovation and environmental concerns, while some man-made obstacles (except for water scarcity) may restrict shale gas development in the medium and long term. In order to better tackle the short-term challenges, this paper proposes policy recommendations from five perspectives: strengthening the investigation and evaluation of China's shale gas resources; perfecting shale gas industry policy; establishing a national shale gas comprehensive experimental zone; enhancing scientific and technological research; and establishing a shale gas regulatory system with an emphasis on environmental protection and supervision. © 2015 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Disruptive education based on action characterizing ecoenvironmental variables to mitigate global warming,"This article develops the proposal of a new method of education.

Western Cape bush medicine: Hunting and gathering coloured healing traditions,"Radical change in South Africa over the last two decades has created impetus for many emergent socio-political movements. Rastafari, a globally recognized religion, is practiced throughout South Africa and has revitalized traditional herbal practices in the exceptionally biodiverse Western Cape region. This chapter examines the interface between the sociopolitical factors that relate to the knowledge, use and trade of medicinal plants by Cape Rastafari. In the Western Cape, contemporary Rasta bush doctors describe themselves as coloured and are proud of their KhoiSan ancestry combining one of the oldest cultures in the world with one of the world's most modern. Bush doctors, who are Rasta's cultural leaders in the region, endorse racial equality, sustainable lifestyles and affordable health care in opposition to capitalistic post-colonial realities. Bush doctors exemplify a non-violent natural alternative to the common gangster lifestyle attractive to township youth, which include drug and alcohol abuse and criminal activities. The shift toward Rastafari began nearly thirty years ago when bush doctors began to collect the healing traditions of the KhoiSan and those of the coloured community. Bush doctors facilitate membership into the Rastafari movement by being visible members of the community, creating medicinal plant gardens in townships and trading at bus and transportation hubs. These herbalists promote the Rasta ethos of healthier and environmentally sustainable lifestyles. Acquiring bush doctor status requires an informal apprenticeship, where trial and error consumption of medicinal plants and transmission of plant knowledge and collection techniques are shared during informal Rastafari gatherings. Interviews with a third of the estimated 200 bush doctors in the Western Cape Region reveal that their shared mission is ""to heal all people."" The ""people"" referred to are the majority of South African citizens living in townships, who struggle with persistent poverty, high rates of unemployment, and poor access to health care. These emergent herbalists reintroduce and practice the healing traditions of the KhoiSan, an ancestry that was largely rejected by coloured people during apartheid. Incredible syncretism was observed in the identity of bush doctors, who are almost exclusively middle-aged coloured males. Despite difficult working conditions including dangerous collection circumstances with little monetary return, bush doctors provide elements of physical, social and psychological healing to the disadvantaged. These herbalists are living examples of transformation that can be achieved by subscribing to the principals of Rastafari. Bush doctors employ an essentialist strategy by becoming dependent upon natural resources for health care requirements. This tactic affirms indigenous ties of coloured people to the KhoiSan and the rights and resources afforded to those of this heritage. A revival of herbalism in the coloured community reinforces ancestral ties, re-instills pride in indigenous traditions, and creates a novel positive affinity for youths in townships. Bush doctors institutionalize this re-appropriated ethnobotanical knowledge by providing a socialist platform of health care. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Win-win REDD+ approaches belie carbon-biodiversity trade-offs,"Recent practise has revealed that conservation interventions that seek to achieve multiple benefits generally face significant, if under-recognized trade-offs. REDD+ policies present prospective win-win solutions for climate change mitigation, rural development and biodiversity conservation. Notably, protecting, enhancing and restoring forests for their carbon sequestration services has the potential to additionally promote the conservation of imperiled tropical biodiversity. However, it has become increasingly apparent that efforts to design a REDD+ mechanism that optimizes emissions reductions and associated co-benefits face significant environmental and economic trade-offs. We provide a framework for conceptualizing the major related policy options, presenting the associated trade-offs as a continuum and as functions of two key factors: (1) geographic targeting, and (2) the selection of specific forest management activities. Our analysis highlights the challenges of assessing trade-offs using existing data and valuation schemes, and the difficulty of paying for and legislating biodiversity co-benefits and safeguards within a future REDD+ mechanism. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

We developed search algorithms, explicit selection criteria, and a coding questionnaire, which we used to review a total of 106 peer-reviewed articles, 145 grey literature docu-ments, and 67 national communications to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); 318 documents were reviewed in total. Quantitatively, the methodology reveals a slight increase in usage, with a focus on non-Annex 1 countries, gender issues, and capacity building. Qualitatively, we arranged the key insights into the following three categories: (1) inclusion in who or what adapts; (2) motivating inclusive processes; and (3) anticipated outcomes of inclusive CCA. We conclude, with the observation, that many issues also apply to Annex 1 countries. We also argue that the common language nature of the word ‘inclusive’ makes it applicable to other CCA-relevant contexts, including government subsidies, science policy, knowledge integration and mobilization, performance measurement, and the breadth of the moral circle that a society should adopt. © 2021 by the authors.

Sustainability in Computing Education: A Systematic Literature Review,"Research shows that the global society as organized today, with our current technological and economic system, is impossible to sustain. We are living in an era in which human activities in highly industrialized countries are responsible for overshooting several planetary boundaries, with poorer communities contributing the least to the problems but being impacted the most. At the same time, technical and economic gains fail to provide society at large with equal opportunities and improved quality of life. This article describes approaches taken in computing education to address the issue of sustainability. It presents results of a systematic review of the literature on sustainability in computing education. From a set of 572 publications extracted from six large digital libraries plus snowballing, we distilled and analyzed 89 relevant primary studies. Using an inductive and deductive thematic analysis, we study (i) conceptions of sustainability, computing, and education; (ii) implementations of sustainability in computing education; and (iii) research on sustainability in computing education. We present a framework capturing learning objectives and outcomes as well as pedagogical methods for sustainability in computing education. These results can be mapped to existing standards and curricula in future work. We find that only a few of the articles engage with the challenges as calling for drastic systemic change, along with radically new understandings of computing and education. We suggest that future work should connect to the substantial body of critical theory, such as feminist theories of science and technology. Existing research on sustainability in computing education may be considered rather immature, as the majority of articles are experience reports with limited empirical research. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Social sustainability and the argan boom as green development in Morocco,"Morocco markets argan oil as a fair-traded, organic health and beauty elixir that women extract in an ancient forest protected internationally to clean the world's air. Since the 1990s, the kingdom has partnered with global governance organizations and foreign investors to develop the argan forest as a coveted natural resource, designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1998. Large-scale investments in reforestation and “arganiculture” propose to mitigate carbon emissions, alleviate poverty, and empower women workers at proliferating state-subsidized argan oil cooperatives in the export-oriented commodity value chain. This impact evaluation of the booming argan enterprise weighs the social benefits and costs of a transnational push that prioritizes economic growth over social sustainability. Empirical data from 829 surveys with local residents depict an unregulated, informal commercial sector at odds with the inclusive neoliberal development narrative on the whole. Results show rural women and their communities exposed to risks in a centralized, market-driven extractivist industry geared toward consumers. The top-down argan boom has triggered new legislation and innovations in science and technology that have shifted control of the land, agroforestry practices, and oil extraction process from local producers to the state. Women and the rural poor have thus been divested of their patrimony and marginally sustained as manual labor rather than effectively empowered. Moving forward, rebalancing economic, environmental, and social sustainability priorities will require initiatives informed by empowerment indicators, revised regulatory policies, diversified investment strategies, and commitment to assuring compliance, transparency, and impartial assessment of benefits and costs to women workers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Psychosocial studies of migration and community: Introduction to the special Issue,"Introducing the special issue on psychosocial studies of migration and community, we briefly reflect on the global increase in, and issues related to, both international and domestic migration, particularly from rural areas of less developed countries, which has fueled rapid urbanization and intercultural tensions in both post-industrial and developing countries. Topics covered in the issue are summarized, including an Italian study of the emotional impact of discrimination against immigrant adolescents; acculturation, integration and adaptation of Muslim immigrant youth in New Zealand; perceptions of human trafficking in Moldova; Chinese migrant workers' social networks, life satisfaction and political participation; physician brain drain from sub-Saharan Africa; and a critical analysis of the oppressive and liberating impact of organizations on immigrants, multiculturalism, and social justice. The issue concludes with commentary articles by four leading international scholars of migration and community. The breadth of topics helps to address wide-ranging gaps in the literature, but more psychological and social research must connect ecologically across multiple levels and to cultural, political, economic, and environmental studies of migration and community. © 2011 Colegio Oficial de Psicólogos de Madrid.",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping and Analyzing Ecological Distribution Conflicts in Andean Countries,"The extractive sector is increasingly important in the GDP and export basket of the four Andean countries under study (ACs) (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia). The analysis of an updated inventory of 296 environmental conflicts in the EJAtlas for these four countries reaches the following conclusions: extractivism causes environmental conflicts related to mining, fossil fuels, hydropower and biomass; indigenous, Afro-descendant and peasant communities are the most affected; behind the conflicts, there are not only environmental impacts but also social impacts that concern livelihoods, land deprivation and work insecurity, and also loss of cultural practices and cultural identity; most of the forms of collective action used in protests are peaceful, most notably petitions, street marches, media activism, lawsuits, while States and companies criminalize activists and are often violent (with about 75 cases in which there are deaths or disappearance of environmental defenders); socio-environmental movements (that sometimes include environmental NGOs) have achieved relative success, stopping 59 of the 296 conflict-generating projects and giving birth to new forms of resistance. While successfully stopping single projects cannot be construed as a general critique of economic growth, such attempts are congruent with post-development, community-centric, ecologically-balanced and culturally-sensitive Andean visions such as buen vivir or sumak kawsay. They are also congruent with policy proposals put forward from a post-economic growth perspective such as “leaving unburnable fuels in the ground” and “resource extraction caps”. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability implications of Rwanda’s Vision 2050 long-term development strategy,"Improving livelihoods in Rwanda requires overcoming food insecurity and malnutrition. Vision 2050 is Rwanda’s long-term development strategy, yet little is known about its potential trade-offs for the country’s biodiversity, forest cover, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Scenario analysis can provide insights into how to achieve such goals more sustainably. Here, we use the Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land-Use, and Energy (FABLE) Calculator, a simple integrated assessment tool, to explore potential sustainability implications by 2050 through two scenarios: (1) Current Trends and (2) Vision 2050. The Vision 2050 pathway incorporates components of the government’s long-term development strategy and associated national agricultural policy targets. It includes greater increases in crop productivity and decreases in post-harvest losses, and shifts to more sustainable diets, compared to the Current Trends pathway. Results show that the Vision 2050 pathway would, relative to Current Trends, lead to a greater decrease in agricultural land area and an increase in non-forested natural land-cover area, with consequent decreases in GHG emissions from agriculture, increases in carbon sequestration, and increases in the share of land that can support biodiversity conservation. Shifts to a healthier diet in the Vision 2050 pathway would only be compatible with national agricultural priorities if these diets favor consumption of foods that underpin sustainable livelihoods in Rwanda, such as beans, cassava, potatoes, sweet potatoes, banana, and corn. We discuss the potential for integrated land-use planning and adoption of agroecological farming practices to help Rwanda achieve food security, livelihood, biodiversity, and climate mitigation goals in tandem. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Irrigation technology and water conservation: A review of the theory and evidence,"Climate change, population growth, and economic development increase competition for water and exacerbate water scarcity- and drought-related losses (IPCC 2014), resulting in the identification of water crises as the greatest global societal threat (WEF 2019). Farming currently accounts for roughly 70 percent of freshwater withdrawals worldwide (FAO 2019) and often constitutes the least productive (i.e., lowest value) use of freshwater resources (Damania et al. 2017). In this context, providing safe, stable, and profitable food production while making incremental water available to alternative uses, including the environment, requires efficiency improvements in agricultural water management (UN 2015). © The Author(s) 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
Grafting to address grand challenges,"The discovery and implementation of grafting (watermelon onto pumpkin to alleviate soil pathogen pressure on crop productivity) at the beginning of the 20th century can be considered as a small belowground revolution, with benefits still occurring today. Indeed, alleviating soilborne diseases and extending early or late yields through rootstock-mediated vigor have been the main driving-forces for the rapid implementation of this technique, mostly in intensive high-value solanaceous and cucurbitaceous crops. Although the percentage of grafting is nearly 100% in some particular crops and in some areas, it is very low in many other species and, particularly, in developing countries. Moreover, the main agronomic traits of interest remain mostly the same, linked to the narrow genetic variability underlying the existing commercial rootstocks. Hence, the potential of using grafting in vegetables worldwide is still enormous, but further development will certainly depend on its capacity to address grand societal challenges: I) securing food production for the increasing population; ii) tackling malnutrition beyond feeding people; iii) conserving natural resources (aboveground and belowground biodiversity, water and soil); and iv) mitigation of, and adaption to, the climate change. Nevertheless, contributing to those societal challenges through grafting requires addressing some scientific and technical challenges: I) identifying agronomic/societal/environmental problems that can be alleviated by changing the root system of elite crop varieties (e.g., specific soilborne or airborne diseases, abiotic stress factors, alone or in combination, use of water and fertilizers, postharvest and/or nutritional properties of the fruits, association with beneficial microorganisms in the rhizosphere, etc.); ii) establishing publicly accessible collections and databases of the germplasm available in different graftable crop species; iii) developing adequate protocols for germplasm phenotyping and selection as a whole plant and as rootstocks according to the target goal or environment; iv) identifying physiological and genetic determinants of the traits of interest for conventional or biotechnological rootstock breeding; v) on-farm demonstration of rootstock impacts and benefit/cost ratio; vi) optimisation of management practices and well-established protocols; vii) rootstock × scion × environment interaction database supporting farmer decisions; and viii) developing high throughput grafting services providing high quality and affordable transplants at the right timing. For example, developing a rootstock conferring tolerance to the parasitic broomrapes for the industry cultivars, and providing cheap transplants to the farmers, could lead to another grafting-mediated belowground revolution with huge socio-economic and environmental impact in some developing countries. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) improve the growth and nutrient use efficiency in maize (Zea mays L.) under water deficit conditions,"Drought is one of the major abiotic stresses that affects crop yield worldwide. An eco-friendly tool that can broadly improve plants' tolerance to water stress is bioionocula comprising plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). In this study, the effect of two PGPR Cupriavidus necator 1C2 (B1) and Pseudomonas fluorescens S3X (B2), singly and/or co-inoculated at two inocula sizes (S1 - 3 × 103 cells g−1 dry weight (dw) soil and S2 - 3 × 106 cells g−1 dw soil), on growth, nutrient uptake, and use efficiency was assessed in maize (Zea mays L.) plants grown at three levels of irrigation (80% of water holding capacity (WHC) – well-watered, 60% of WHC - moderate water deficit stress, and 40% of WHC - severe water deficit stress) in a greenhouse experiment. The impact of water deficit and bioinoculants on soil microbial activity (fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis) was also evaluated. Moderate and severe water deficit negatively affected soil microbial activity, as well as, maize growth, by reducing plants' shoot biomass and increasing root/shoot ratio at 60 and 40% of WHC. Bioinoculants mitigated the negative effects on shoot biomass, especially when PGPR were co-inoculated, increasing up to 89% the aerial biomass of plants exposed to moderate water deficit. Bioinoculation also increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) use efficiency, which may have led to higher maize growth under water deficit conditions. The size of the inocula applied had marginal influence on biometric and nutrient parameters, although the higher concentration of the mixture of PGPR was the most effective in improving shoot biomass under moderate water deficit. This study shows that rhizobacterial strains are able to increase nutrient use efficiency and to alleviate water stress effects in crops with high water demands and have potential applications to keep up with productivity in water stress scenarios. © 2020; Agricultural sciences; Biotechnology; Microbiology; Bioinoculants; Drought; Inocula size; Water deficit; Water scarcity; Agricultural soil science; Agricultural water management; Crop biomass; Microbial biotechnology; Nutrient availability © 2020",Not About Sufficiency
Understanding the limitations of current RFMO climate change adaptation strategies: the case of the IATTC and the Eastern Pacific Ocean,"While Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) face many challenges in their pursuit of sustainable resource development, climate change is among the most pressing and least addressed. Research has identified a host of expected or ongoing physical, biological, ecological, and social impacts of climate change on the marine environment, creating a strong climate change adaptation imperative for RFMOs. Through a case study of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), we describe two serious limitations of current RFMO climate change adaptation strategies: (1) a weakened efficacy of resource management and conservation policies caused by viewing climate change as a general climate stressor rather than a unique environmental challenge, and (2) a reliance on incremental policy reform, problematic because it may not enable a pace or scale of policy change proportional to the sustainable development challenges created by a rapidly changing ocean. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of incrementalism and outline potential solutions to the environmental and structural challenges facing the IATTC and other RFMOs, including the concept of adaptation pathways. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
A comment on 'Climate change: Social workers' roles and contributions to policy debates and interventions',"In this commenting article, I present several critical remarks about Lena Dominelli's contribution to the issue of climate change and its implications for social work. In my view, her article lacks three important considerations. First, I argue that the issue of climate change should be addressed as part of a broader, fundamental challenge: the transition of the growth-based economic system upon which our society is built. Second, within a context of social and ecological injustice, dealing with climate change inevitably requires a dimension of social struggle. Third and lastly, I emphasise social work's role in challenging the social, political and economic structures and processes that bring about climate change. © 2011 The Author(s) International Journal of Social Welfare. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the International Journal of Social Welfare.",Not About Sufficiency
The place of social work in sustainable development: Towards ecosocial practice,"Ecological questions are seldom seen to concern the social dimension and, accordingly, to be of direct concern to mainstream social work practice. However, the current 'social-ecological crisis' demands a major social transition to a sustainable society that touches all dimensions of our lives. So, social work cannot escape this process. This article argues that social work can engage in this transition starting from its social mission and tradition, provided it includes the ecological environment as an important element of practice and develops an ecosocial practice centred on empowerment, social capital formation and resilience building as both a contribution to and part of a process of social-political change. © 2011 The Author(s) International Journal of Social Welfare © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the International Journal of Social Welfare.",Not About Sufficiency

Role of groundwater in buffering irrigation production against climate variability at the basin scale in South-West India,"The basaltic aquifers of the Upper Bhima River Basin in India are highly utilized for irrigation but the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals and the agricultural production systems they support is largely unknown. Here we used hydrogeological data, supported by secondary data, to assess the effects of water scarcity over a decade-long period (1998-2007) on the groundwater resources at the regional basin scale. This reveals no evidence of systematic declines in total groundwater availability over the period; only shorter-term losses/gains in storage associated with successive dry/wet years. The clearest indicator of stress comes from the more widespread drying out of wells following lower rainfall years throughout the basin and especially in upland areas where aquifers are least developed and most easily drained. Groundwater in the basin offers an adaptive mechanism to climate variability to some degree, but the buffering capacity is constrained by low aquifer storativity and average residence times of just a few years. Around 40% of the basin is currently at a level of development that is of concern, and the number of irrigation wells is growing rapidly. However recent evidence of conversion from high to low water use crops indicates the adaptive capacity of farmers to water-related stresses. Surplus surface water flows may provide opportunities to enhance groundwater recharge but requires careful trade-off analysis of the downstream impacts. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"COVID-19 Pandemic, Climate Change, and Conflicts on Agriculture: A Trio of Challenges to Global Food Security","Global food security is a worldwide concern. Food insecurity is a significant threat to poverty and hunger eradication goals. Agriculture is one of the focal points in the global policy agenda. Increases in agricultural productivity through the incorporation of technological advances or expansion of cultivable land areas have been pushed forward. However, production growth has slowed in many parts of the world due to various endemic challenges, such as decreased investment in agricultural research, lack of infrastructure in rural areas, and increasing water scarcity. Climate change adversities in agriculture and food security are increasing. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected global food supply chains. Economic and social instability from the pandemic contribute to long-term disturbances. Additionally, conflicts such as war directly affect agriculture by environmental degradation, violence, and breaches of national and international trade agreements. A combination of food security and climate change challenges along with increased conflicts among nations and post-COVID-19 social and economic issues bring bigger and more serious threats to agriculture. This necessitates the strategic design of policies through multifaceted fields regarding food systems. In this comprehensive review, we explore how these three challenging factors, COVID-19, climate change, and conflicts, are interrelated, and how they affect food security. We discuss the impact of these issues on the agricultural sector, plus possible ways of preventing or overcoming such adverse effects. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Applying a public health context to climate change,"Human-caused climate change is creating, both directly and indirectly, profound and widespread environmental and health consequences. Mitigation (primary prevention) policies in the energy, transportation, and agriculture sectors can reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) while simultaneously providing near-term health co-benefits. Adaptation (secondary prevention) actions can reduce the health consequences of climate change, and some adaptation actions can also mitigate GHG emissions. This chapter includes some strategies, such as communicating the health relevance of climate change, building movements, and promoting climate justice, that can strengthen public and political support to address climate change. This chapter also includes textboxes on disparities and on a brief history of organizational responses to climate change, including the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). © Oxford University Press 2024.

"Planetary health indicators for the local level: opportunities and challenges in applying the happy planet index in Victoria, Australia","The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, New Urban Agenda and Paris Agreement on Climate Change are blueprints for health promotion action that mandate human health is linked inextricably to the health of the environment. In the Anthropocene, new indicators are required to promote community engagement with, and measurement of, healthy and sustainable wellbeing for people and planet. This study explored the need for a metric such as the Happy Planet Index that explicitly links human health to health of the environment for a local level scale in Australia. The project arose from an international coalition of health promoters advocating for ‘planetary health’ approaches. Qualitative description methods guided the study design involving key informant interviews (n = 17) and four focus groups (n = 27 participants) with health and/or sustainability academics, practitioners and policy-makers. Document analysis of health and environment indices and policy mandates augmented the analysis. Qualitative content analysis techniques were used to analyse the findings. There was strong interest for a local level composite indicator, such as a rescaled Happy Planet Index (life expectancy × life satisfaction × equity adjustment/ecological footprint) for use at a local level. The value of a composite index was: its ability to promote community engagement with planetary health thinking; an advocacy tool for joint health and sustainability policy; to justify programs on health and environmental co-benefits; and to provide a mechanism for correlative comparisons between local governments and national comparisons. However, disciplinary silos currently limit partnerships for health promotion and planetary health and a local composite index could help bridge these divides. © The Author(s) 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
The process of building the priority of neglected tropical diseases: A global policy analysis,"The global burden attributed to Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) is 47.9 million Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). These diseases predominantly affect disadvantaged popu-lations. Priority for NTDs has grown in recent years, which is observed by their inclusion in the sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study analyzed the process that allowed these diseases to be included on the global health policy agenda. This global policy analysis used the Shiffman and Smith framework to understand the determinants of global health political priority for NTDs. The framework comprises four categories: actor power, ideas, political contexts, and issue characteristics. Global documents and World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions were examined, key-informant interviews were conducted, and academic publications were reviewed to understand the four categories that comprise the framework. A total of 37 global policy documents, 15 WHA resolutions, and 38 academic publications were examined. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals representing different sectors within the NTD community who have been involved in raising the priority of these diseases. This study found that several factors helped better position NTDs in the global health agenda. These include the leadership of actors that mobilized the global health community, the creation of a label combining these diseases as a group to represent a larger disease burden, the presence of mechanisms aligning the NTD community, and the agreement on ways to present the NTD burden and potential solutions. The process of building the priority of NTDs in the global health agenda shows that several determinants led to positive outcomes, but these diseases continue to have low priority at the global level which requires the implementation of actions to increase their global priority. These include sustaining the commitment of current actors and engaging new ones; increasing the attention given to diseases formerly categorized as “tool-deficient”, including zoonotic NTDs; continue leveraging on policy windows and creating favorable policy moments to sustain commitment, as well as setting realistic targets. Findings from this study can help develop strategies to build the momentum and drive actions to implement the goals of the new Roadmap for NTDs in the pathway to universal health coverage (UHC) and sustainable development. © 2020 Aya Pastrana et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Air quality improvement in Los Angeles—perspectives for developing cities,"Air quality improvement in Los Angeles, California is reviewed with an emphasis on aspects that may inform air quality policy formulation in developing cities. In the mid-twentieth century the air quality in Los Angeles was degraded to an extent comparable to the worst found in developing cities today; ozone exceeded 600 ppb and annual average particulate matter <10 μm reached ~150 mg∙m–3. Today's air quality is much better due to very effective emission controls; e.g., modern automobiles emit about 1% of the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emitted by vehicles of 50 years ago. An overview is given of the emission control efforts in Los Angeles and their impact on ambient concentrations of primary and secondary pollutants; the costs and health benefits of these controls are briefly summarized. Today's developing cities have new challenges that are discussed: the effects of regional pollution transport are much greater in countries with very high population densities; often very large current populations must be supplied with goods and services even while economic development and air quality concerns are addressed; and many of currently developing cities are located in or close to the tropics where photochemical processing of pollution is expected to be more rapid than at higher latitudes. The air quality issues of Beijing are briefly compared and contrasted with those of Los Angeles, and the opportunities for co-benefits for climate and air quality improvement are pointed out.

Routledge handbook on the politics of global health,"In the early twenty-first century, key public health issues and challenges have taken centre stage on the global scene, and health has been placed at the heart of our collective aspirations for human development and well-being. But significant debate exists not only about the causes, but also about the possible solutions for nearly all of the most important global health challenges. Competing visions of the values and perspectives that should underlie global health policies have emerged, ranging from an emphasis on cost eff ectiveness and resource constraints on one extreme, to new calls for health and human rights, and renewed calls for health and social justice on the other. The role of different intergovernmental agencies, bilateral or unilateral donors, public or private institutions and initiatives, has increasingly been called into question, whilst the spread of neoliberal policies and programmes, and existing international trade regimes and intellectual property rights, are deeply implicated in relation to global health responses. This volume critically evaluates how the global health industry has evolved and how the interests of diverse political and economic stakeholders are shaping the context of a rapidly changing institutional landscape. Bringing together leading authors from across the world, the Handbook's eight sections explore: Critical perspectives on global health; Globalisation, neoliberalism, and health systems; The changing shape of global health governance; Development assistance and the politics of global health; Scale-up, scale-down, and the sustainability of global health programmes; Intellectual property rights, trade relations, and global health; Humanitarian emergencies and global health politics; Human rights, social justice, and global health. The Routledge Handbook on the Politics of Global Health addresses both the emerging issues and conceptualisations of the political strategies, policy-making processes, and global governance of global health, along with expanding upon and highlighting the critical priorities in this rapidly evolving field. It provides an authoritative overview for students, practitioners, researchers, and policymakers working in or concerned with the politics of public health around the globe. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Richard Parker and Jonathan García; individual chapters, the contributors.

Understanding ethical consumers: willingness-to-pay by moral cause,"Purpose: Moral issues such as environmental degradation and workers’ rights are no longer relegated to the political realm; today, they permeate the marketing of consumer products. Some consumer studies focus on organics, others on green goods and still others on fair trade products, but none include the full range of ethical consumption. This study, aims to investigate consumer willingness to pay for five distinct ethical narratives. Design/methodology/approach: Using original data from a national sample, this paper parses out five types of ethical narratives: fair trade, sustainable/green, American-made and two types of charitable partnerships. Using random assignment and an experimental design allows in isolating the effects of gender, age, education, income, political orientation and political involvement on how much consumers are willing to pay for each type of ethical product. Findings: This survey experiment demonstrates that the fair trade narrative is the most valuable to consumers, followed by the charitable narratives. The two charitable narratives are universally appealing, whereas fair trade, green and American-made products appeal to three distinct groups of consumers. This paper demonstrates that there is not one sort of ethical shopper, but many. Practical/implications: This study examines what sorts of stories appeal to particular demographics. It will help socially and environmentally responsible companies better understand their target demographic and how to motivate their target audience. Originality/value: Previous research yields conflicting findings about who values ethical products because each study focuses on a different form of ethical consumption. This study uses original data to investigate consumers’ valuations of five different types of ethical narratives. The results help in making sense of divergent findings in the literature and expand understanding of socially conscious shoppers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
A comparison of electricity production technologies in terms of sustainable development,"The electricity production sector has currently and for the past years been dominated by fossil fuel technologies, mostly coal, oil and natural gas. This has had various environmental consequences, such as increased gaseous emissions, soil and water pollution, global warming, as well as fossil resource depletion. As a result, the need to pursue Sustainable Development (SD), in order to reduce dependency on fossil fuel, to achieve Greenhouse Gas (GHG) mitigation and to reverse the effects of climate change has currently become imperative. SD is considered to be one of the most important factors for countries' energy policy today and efforts, such as the ones materialized through the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, are being made to promote sustainable electricity production technologies globally. Nuclear and renewable energy technologies both have the potential of contributing to the increasing global energy demands, while simultaneously lowering GHG emissions and also having a positive economic and social impact. In view of their differences and the ongoing nuclear debate, this paper aims to compare specific promising and emerging nuclear and renewable energy technologies in terms of their contribution to SD and prospects for deployment. The comparison showed that each technology contributes in its own way to SD and that political decisions, individual country energy policies and public opinion will probably determine the future deployment of each energy technology. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Food waste in the food service sector: A case study from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Every year one-third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted (FAO 2013). This wastage represents losses of valuable nutrients, energy and natural resources. At a global scale food wastage is also responsible for greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions comparable to those of the top ten GHG emitting countries in the world (FAO 2014), as well as contributing to food insecurity and posing ethical questions. How is it that the global food system leaves one in nine people malnourished or hungry and on the other hand wastes one-third of the food supplies? Food wastage represents an annual loss in economic value equal to USD 1 trillion across the global food supply chain (FAO 2013). The magnitude and complexity of the food waste problem has brought it to the forefront of the political agenda in most developed countries. This problem is expected to continue to grow, especially in developing countries, considering the likely changes in the food systems in these countries due to industrialisation, urbanisation and changes in diets and lifestyles (Garnett and Wilkes 2014). © 2016 Marlyne Sahakian, Czarina Saloma and Suren Erkman, selection and editorial material; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
Rattling Europe’s ordoliberal ‘iron cage’: the contestation of austerity in Southern Europe,"This article explains the popular revolt against austerity in Southern Europe as the outcome of profound politico-economic changes that are shaped by the transformation of the European Union’s (EU’s) macro-economic governance. It comprises three parts. The first part demonstrates how ordoliberalism – the Germanic variant of (neo)liberal economic thinking – was embedded in the EU’s new macro-economic governance, in processes that constitutionalise austerity and remove democratic controls over the economy. The second part examines the impact of austerity-driven reforms on welfare and employment in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis. These reforms undermined the social reproduction of Southern Europe’s familistic welfare model by destabilising three key pillars of social protection: employment security for households’ primary earners; small property ownership; and pension adequacy. The third part analyses the emergence of anti-austerity social politics in Southern Europe, both parliamentary and grassroots, and assesses their effectiveness in light of the collapse of public trust in both EU and domestic political institutions.

Global health research: Changing the agenda,"Background In the face of multiple, diverse and emerging global health threats, global health research has a central role to play in developing effective interventions and sustainable policies to deal with these challenges, especially in the context of reaching the targets set by the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As recently stated, “research is a major driver of social and technological innovation that can lead to health and equity improvements through a knowledge-to-action process” (Coloma & Harris, 2009) and, through global health science, “we will never have a better opportunity to improve public health globally” (Farrar, 2007). The world today faces not only threats from pandemics of infectious disease, e.g. pandemic influenza H1N1, but has to contend with the emergence of resistance to antimicrobial agents, chronic diseases, an aging population, fragile health systems and the health impacts of globalization, e.g. those related to climate change, travel and migration, food insecurity, lack of clean water and the global spread of harmful lifestyles and substances. It is also a reality that it is the developing world that is bearing the brunt of the global disease burden. Despite increasing amounts of resources spent on global health R&D, an estimated $160 billion in 2005 (Global Forum for Health Research, 2008), there are concerns with the impact of the current financial crisis on the funding of health research, continued weaknesses and constraints in research capacity in developing countries, the inadequacies of the current modes of global health research governance, and the way resources are currently distributed to various areas and types of health research. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",Not About Sufficiency
A comprehensive review of climate change’s imprint on ecosystems,"In the 21st century, climate change, which is predominantly caused by human activities, has emerged as a major global concern. This paper examines in depth the profound and multifarious effects of climate change on ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. It further investigates the complex connections between climate change and ecosystems, focusing on terrestrial, aquatic, and marine habitats. Nota-bly, we emphasize the unique challenges confronting ecosystems in Southeast Asia, a region of ecological significance where the ocean economy is fundamental to human livelihoods. Climate change threatens ecosystem services in numerous ways, including the provision of food and water, climate regulation, nutrient cycling, and cultural importance. We emphasize the potential transformation of ecosystems from carbon sinks to carbon sources, which has implications for climate control. Moreover, changes in disease vectors and altered land-scapes raise concerns for human health and cultural traditions. We emphasize the importance of international cooperation, as exemplified by the Paris Agreement, in mitigating climate change collectively. In addition, we advocate for the inclusion of indigenous communities and traditional ecological knowledge in conservation and restoration initiatives. This paper concludes by emphasizing the profound interdependence between ecosystems and human well-being and the urgency of taking action. © 2023 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Designing a better food system in India: A Design Thinking Approach,"Climate change, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, water scarcity, and food insecurity are just a few of the issues threatening India's food system's sustainability. We require a more sustainable approach to food production and consumption in order to address these issues. We can influence lasting change in the food system by using the method to problem-solving known as 'design thinking.' This research paper aims to explore how design thinking can be used to design a better food system in India. We conducted a literature review of relevant studies, reports, and case studies and analyzed the findings to identify common themes and best practices. Our analysis revealed that design thinking can be used to design a better food system in India in several ways, including user-entered design, cross-sector collaboration, innovation and experimentation, and systems thinking. We present a case study of a design thinking approach to addressing food waste in India and discuss the implications and potential of design thinking for designing a better food system in India. © 2024 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
Influence of super absorbent hydrophilic polymers on enhancing resources use efficiency and crop productivity in Vertisols,"Water scarcity is a significant challenge in agriculture, particularly in arid and semiarid regions. Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs), such as hydrogels, have emerged as effective tools for enhancing soil moisture retention and improving crop yield and water productivity in these environments. A two-year field study was conducted to examine the impacts of hydrogel type and application depth on soil water distribution, water productivity and spinach growth. Two types of hydrogels, polymer-based (Hydrogel-1) and small organic molecule-based (Hydrogel-2), were applied at three depths—surface (D1), 5 cm (D2) and 10 cm (D3)—in a randomized block design. The results revealed that the water absorption capacity and water salinity of Hydrogel-1 were negatively correlated, whereas those of Hydrogel-2 were unaffected by salinity. Compared with that of the control, the soil moisture retention improved with deeper hydrogel application, with the Hydrogel-1 treatment at 10 cm extending irrigation intervals by 2–4 days. Hydrogel application at greater depths significantly increased spinach growth metrics, including plant height, leaf count, leaf area, root length, SPAD value and yield, resulting in the highest yield (5.7 kg/m2) and water productivity (44.8 kg/m3). The study concludes that applying hydrogels at a depth of 10 cm is optimal for maximizing resource use efficiency and water productivity in spinach grown in vertisols. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Introduction to impact of climate change on food security and safety,"Climate change is an abnormal variation in the average weather patterns that have both direct and indirect impacts on agricultural and livestock production systems. Climate change will increasingly cause adverse impacts on agricultural production through a decline in water supplies, increased heat, drought, and insect out¬breaks, increased prevalence of pests and plant diseases. Scientists are executing various approaches to develop a sustainable food security system through development of new food sources based on plants and animals, organic farming, cell-based food production, aquatic food systems, development of integrated systems of plant and animal production practices. Although researchers are developing new food resources but facing many chal¬lenges to food safety and security like new and emerging bacteria, toxins, and antimicrobial resistance, changes in consumer preferences and habits, food contamination, food production and imported foods supply, and so on, hopefully scientists will resolve the hurdles in coming decades. © CAB International 2025.

Sustaining future food security in changing environments,"Access to adequate food and nutrition is a fundamental human right. However, a significant population worldwide presently suffers from malnutrition and inadequate access to food. To meet the goal of zero hunger and malnutrition, agricultural production must maintain pace with increasing food demand. This goal is being challenged by rapidly changing socio-economic and environmental issues. Climate change, depleting soil and water resources, air, water and soil pollution are not only reducing productivity, but also pose a threat to food safety and nutrition. This book analyzes linkages between agriculture and environmental changes, major challenges and potential solutions to secure future food security. It covers, in detail, the impacts of major environmental changes including climate change and air pollution on crops and agricultural production. The potential solutions to address these challenges are also discussed. This book provides the reader with a broad view of interactions between agriculture and the environment, where agriculture is not only vulnerable but also acts as a contributor and offers mitigation options for some of the challenges in sustaining future food security. Agricultural sustainability in near and long-term future will depend on adapting crops and crop management practices based on emerging scientific knowledge of plant physiology and resource efficient technologies combined with focused socio-economic reforms to conserve food diversity and traditional practices. With the help of specific case studies, this book also highlights the significance of reforming small scale farming practices. Overall, this book provides the core idea of sustainable agriculture and food production in current and future scenarios, and is recommended for anyone interested in this topic. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Carbon sequestration in agroforestry systems,"Management of trees in agroecosystems such as agroforestry, ethnoforests, and trees outside forests can mitigate green house gas (GHG) emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Agroforestry systems are a better climate change mitigation option than oceanic, and other terrestrial options because of the secondary environmental benefits such as helping to attain food security and secure land tenure in developing countries, increasing farm income, restoring and maintaining above-ground and below-ground biodiversity, corridors between protected forests, as CH4 sinks, maintaining watershed hydrology, and soil conservation. Agroforestry also mitigates the demand for wood and reduces pressure on natural forests. Promoting woodcarving industry facilitates long-term locking-up of carbon in carved wood and new sequestration through intensified tree growing. By making use of local knowledge, equity, livelihood security, trade and industry, can be supported. There is need to support development of suitable policies, assisted by robust country-wide scientific studies aimed at better understanding the potential of agroforestry and ethnoforestry for climate change mitigation and human well-being. © 2002 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
How organizations can use carbon emissions data to achieve carbon neutrality,"To help China achieve the ""dual carbon""goal at an early date and mitigate global climate change brought about by the greenhouse effect, people are increasingly interested in topics such as carbon neutrality, sustainability, and energy, which has led to apparent changes in many cross-disciplinary disciplines. While upgrading the organization industry, people often neglect to implement measures from the energy side. The study is based on 492 articles retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database between 1900 and 2023, and conducted comprehensive data and visual analysis of keywords such as ""carbon neutrality"", ""carbon emissions"", and ""carbon footprint"". Bibliometrics show that publications have proliferated since 2008 and also involve multiple disciplines, such as management, sustainable development studies, public health, energy, and other related major fields. At the same time, research institutions in China, the United Kingdom, and Singapore have excelled in such disciplines. The authors use big data analysis technology and visualization software to comprehensively analyze the research results in the form of charts from the aspects of literature publication and citation trends, top research institutions, and keyword clustering, which provides research ideas for research organizations to use carbon emission data to achieve carbon neutrality. © 2023 EDP Sciences.

Characterization of implementation limits and identification of optimization strategies for sustainable water resource recovery through life cycle impact analysis,"How we manage alternative freshwater resources to close the gap between water supply and demand is pivotal to the future of the environment and human well-being. Increased scarcity of water for agricultural irrigation in semi-arid and arid regions has resulted in a growing interest in water reuse practices. However, insight into the life cycle impacts and potential trade-offs of these emerging practices are still limited by the paucity of systematic evaluations of different water reuse implementations. In this study, a host of environmental and human health impacts at three implementation levels of allowing water reclamation for crop irrigation was comparatively evaluated across the operational landscape via a combination of scenario modelling, life-cycle impact analyses and Monte Carlo simulations. Net harvesting of reclaimed water for irrigation was found to be dependent upon the sophistication of the treatment processes, since multistage and complex configurations can cause greater direct water consumption during processing. Further, the direct benefits of water resource recovery can be essentially offset by indirect adverse impacts, such as mineral depletion, global warming, ozone depletion, ecotoxicity, and human health risks, which are associated with increased usage of energy and chemicals for rigorous removal of contaminants, such as heavy metals and contaminants of emerging concern. Nonetheless, expanded simulations suggest the significance of concurrently implementing energy recovery, nutrient recycling, and/or nature-based, chemical-free water technologies to reduce the magnitude of negative impacts from engineered water reclamation processes. © 2019 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

Human Rights and Labour Standards from the Public Health Perspective in the World Trade Organization: Challenges and Possible Solutions,"This study investigates the effects of the interaction between labor standards and human rights that has become a key issue in the World Trade organization. Policy makers gradually developed new rules to achieve both trade and human rights objectives. England signed treaties with the U.S., Portugal, Denmark and Sweden to ban trade in slaves ect. The trade labour linkage has a long history. It has become one of the most contentious contemporary issues in trade and labour policy circles and debates. The idea of using international labour standards to protect workers from economic exploitation was first promoted by individual social reformers in Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century during the early stages of the industrial revolution. Calls for an international labour legislation increased dramatically during the second half of the nineteenth century and found expression in various international organizations that were formed (often international associations of trade unions). Besides, international trade policy and labor standards can also hurt the right to health, directly or indirectly. As a result, there are several problems which can be identified regarding the International rules on trade as a whole and from the public health perspective. Without the national or international required action, international trade will not bring prosperity to all, but, on the contrary, it is likely to result in more income inequality, social injustice, environmental degradation and cultural homogenization.

Can humans outsmart rodents? Learning to work collectively and strategically,"Context Rodents are one of the major constraints in Asian rice production, both in pre- and post-harvest. Rodents are often perceived by farmers in developing countries to be consistently outsmarting humans a belief that needs to be overcome. Ecologically based rodent management (EBRM) is a possible solution to manage rodent populations effectively, which in turn can help sustain food security in Asia. Well coordinated community action is necessary to effectively carry out EBRM. This paper considers the socio-cultural challenges of EBRM. Aims To determine whether a multi-stakeholder partnership, facilitated through experiential learning and the use of existing social capital, can generate collective actions for strategic rodent management. Methods Participatory action research was employed in the implementation of EBRM in irrigated rice systems in the Red River Delta in Vietnam. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used including household surveys, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Key results The multi-stakeholder partnership and participatory approach effectively generated adoption of EBRM. The strong linkages between extension and political organisations generated diffusion of EBRM into neighbouring provinces. The adoption of EBRM reduced rodenticide use (50%), decreased rice areas with rodent damage (93%), increased rice yields (1014%), increased economic returns for farmers (20%), strengthened farmers' collective actions, and changed farmers' perspectives on rodent management towards a biologically sustainable approach. Conclusions Humans can indeed outsmart rodents through the use of EBRM principles that rely on community actions. Sustainable community actions can be achieved through participatory approaches and a multi-stakeholder partnership built on existing social capital of the society and local communities. Overall, the adoption of EBRM meant better rice yields, higher economic returns for farmers, and reduced human health and environmental risks. Implications To address the problem of sustainable adoption by farmers of an agricultural technology for natural resource management, active participation of various stakeholders through a multi-stakeholder partnership is essential. This partnership should emanate from the social capital of the society, such as the networks of organisations across different scales, from the national to the village level, and the cultural norms and values adhered to by the members of the society and local communities. © 2011 CSIRO.",Not About Sufficiency

Effects of different thinning systems on the economic value of ecosystem services: A case-study in a black pine peri-urban forest in Central Italy,"Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) should be able to produce an optimal level of bundle of Ecosystem Services (ES), thus ensuring more resilient forest ecosystems and creating benefits for local population and human well-being. Yet, choosing between alternative forest management practices is not straightforward as it necessarily involves ES trade-offs. Forest management decisions have to reconcile the socio-economic and ecological contributions of forest ecosystems by fostering a synergistic relation between multiple ES while lowering ES trade-offs. The aim of the study is to analyze different forest management practices (selective and traditional thinning) in black pine peri-urban forest in Central Italy, by investigating their contribution in terms of provisioning (wood production), cultural (recreational benefits) and regulating (climate change mitigation) ES. For each management option was performed: (1) a biophysical assessment of selected ES by using primary data and calculating indicators for wood production with special regard to biomass for energy use (living trees and deadwood volume harvested), recreational benefits (tourists’ preferences for each forest management practice), climate change mitigation (carbon sequestration in above-ground and below-ground biomass), and (2) an economic valuation of wood production, recreational benefits and climate change mitigation ES using direct and indirect methods (environmental evaluation techniques). The results show that the effects of the selective thinning on ES are higher that the effects of the traditional thinning. The economic value of the three ES provided by traditional and selective thinning are respectively: bioenergy production 154.2 € ha-1 yr-1 and 223.3 € ha-1 yr-1; recreational benefits 193.2 € ha-1 yr-1 and 231.9 € ha-1 yr-1; carbon sequestration 29.0 € ha-1 yr-1 and 36.2 € ha-1 yr-1. The integrated (biophysical and economic) assessment of ES in addition to the trade-off analysis can provide multi-perspective insights for forest policy makers and can be included as a part of the local forest management plans. © 2017, Editura Silvica.

"Assessing sustainable development pathways for water, food, and energy security in a transboundary river basin","Worldwide hundreds of millions of people suffer from water, food and energy insecurity in transboundary river basins, such as the Zambezi River Basin. The interconnected nature of nexus is often not recognized in investment planning and many regional policymakers lack adequate tools to tackle it. Future growing demands and climate change add an additional challenge. In this study, we combine policy relevant co-developed stakeholder scenarios and integrated nexus modeling tools to identify key solutions to achieve sustainable development in the Zambezi. Results show that siloed development without coordination achieves the least economic and social benefits in the long term. Prioritizing economic benefits by maximizing the use of available natural resources results in the expansion of irrigated areas by more than a million hectares and increase in hydropower production by 22,000 GWh/year in the coming decades, bringing significant economic benefits, up to $12.7 billion per year, but causes local water scarcity and negative impacts on the environment. Combining environmental protection policies with sustainable investments of $7.2 billion per year (e.g. groundwater pumping and wastewater treatment and reuse, irrigation efficiency improvements, and farmer support aimed to improve food security and productivity) results in significantly higher social benefits with economic benefits that still reach $11.7 billion per year. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

Governance of the water-energy-food security nexus: A multi-level coordination challenge,"The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus is increasingly perceived as promising approach to overcome governance failures in dealing with complex and interconnected resource management challenges. Are such expectations warranted and what is required to mobilize the transformative potential inherent in this approach? The paper addresses these questions and argues in favour of developing a nexus paradigm which guides processes of purposeful design and of self-organization of nexus governance systems. Such a paradigm could be anchored in addressing water, energy and food security from a nexus perspective if such a security concept is appropriately defined and operationalized. To develop the argument, governance challenges arising from the different logics of the concepts of water, energy and food security are addressed with a definition for WEF security from a nexus perspective. An analytical framework using a network and ecosystem services perspective is introduced. The power of the approach introduced is illustrated for a typical case to identify coordination failures and persistent sustainability problems but as well leverage points for transformative change. The paper concludes by elaborating on the transformative potential of the SDGs and on the role of a WEF nexus approach in realizing such a potential. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Examining the nexus of energy intensity, renewables, natural resources, and carbon intensity in India","India remained the third-largest energy consumer in the world, responsible for around 7% of global carbon emissions due to rising incomes and improving living standards. Although resource extraction has quadrupled since 1970 due to rising population and demand for natural resources, energy use and transformation, notably of fossil fuel energy, have increased by around 45%, thus increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this view, this study aims to explore energy intensity, renewable energy, natural resources, economic growth, and environmental degradation nexus in India. The novel dynamic simulated autoregressive distributed lag and kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS) approaches are used to explore the effects of energy intensity, renewable energy, natural resources, and economic growth on carbon intensity for India from 1970 to 2020. The empirical results reveal that renewable energy and natural resources improve India's environmental quality via the mitigation of carbon emissions. It is also found that energy intensity and economic growth deteriorate the country's environmental quality by increasing carbon emissions in the short- and long run. A series of robustness estimation affirms the above evidence, thus providing requisite guideline for relevant policy recommendations for the country. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Design and Operation of Effective Landfills with Minimal Effects on the Environment and Human Health,"Totaling at 7.4 billion people, the world's population is rapidly growing, bringing along with it an increase in waste generation. The impact of this exponential increase in waste generation has resulted in the increased formation and utilization of landfills. In the present day, landfills are utilized to dispose of chemical, hazardous, municipal, and electronic wastes. However, despite their convenience, most landfills are improperly managed and face constant changes from the surrounding environment that interfere with their internal landfill processes. The objectives of this mixed review are to highlight the negative impacts landfills have on the environment and public health as well as outline the need for proper management practices to mitigate these effects. Inadequate management of landfills leads to issues concerning leachate collection and landfill gas (LFG) generation, which give rise to groundwater contamination and air pollution. This paper recognizes the disadvantages of utilizing landfills as the main disposal method by focusing on these two primary effects that improper management of landfills has on the environment and human health. Many experts have also reported that communities within close proximity to improperly managed landfills have an increased risk of health issues. Apart from implementing proper landfill management practices, it is important to develop solutions to reduce waste generation altogether. This review discusses some of the innovative methods implemented by other countries to reduce landfill waste and the production of greenhouse gases as well as possible steps individuals can take to minimize their ecological footprints. © 2021 Gulnihal Ozbay et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Effect of climate change adaptation options on monthly food shortages among smallholder farmers in West Africa,"Climate change is among the topmost economic development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This paper analysed the effect of rural households' adaptation options on monthly food shortages. The data were collected with multi-stage sampling by the Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) as a baseline survey to provide comparable data on the impact of climate change in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Senegal using multi-stage sampling method. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and Poisson regression model. Results show that reported erratic and less overall rainfalls mostly affected peanut, although in Burkina Faso and Mali, sorghum and millet were most affected. The farmers were making some changes on their farming systems with 15.94% introducing new crops in Senegal, 23.57% tested new crops in Niger and 81.43% grew high yielding varieties in Ghana. Drought resistant varieties were grown by 20.71% of the farmers from Burkina Faso, 17.86% of those from Ghana and 12.06% of those from Mali. The results of Poisson regression revealed that the data were adequately fitted judging from statistical insignificance of the deviance goodness of fit (p>0.10). Specifically, more involvement of men in raw food production, late planting of crops, number of months households depended on home production, residence in Mali and Senegal reduced the count of monthly food shortages, while introduction of stone lines, residence in Ghana and more involvement of men in timber production increased it (p<0.05). It was concluded that adequate adaptation will assist farmers to mitigate the impact of climate change on food security.",Not About Sufficiency
On energy for sustainable development in Nigeria,"The fuel driving the engine of growth and sustainable development of any nation is the nation's access to reliable and adequate energy. Access to energy is a crucial enabling condition for achieving sustainable development. Prudent energy policies and research can play an important role in steering both industrialized and developing countries onto more sustainable energy development paths. Specifically, they can strengthen the three pillars of sustainable development: the economy, by boosting productivity; social welfare, by improving living standards and enhancing safety and security; and the environment, by reducing indoor and outdoor pollution and remediating environmental degradation. Many factors that need to be considered and appropriately addressed in moving towards energy sustainability in Nigeria are examined in this article. These include full exploitation and promotion of renewable energy resources and application of energy conservation measures in various sectors such as manufacturing industrial set-up, office and residential buildings and transportation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A dynamic simulation model to support reduction in illegal trade within legal wildlife markets,"Sustainable wildlife trade is critical for biodiversity conservation, livelihoods, and food security. Regulatory frameworks are needed to secure these diverse benefits of sustainable wildlife trade. However, regulations limiting trade can backfire, sparking illegal trade if demand is not met by legal trade alone. Assessing how regulations affect wildlife market participants’ incentives is key to controlling illegal trade. Although much research has assessed how incentives at both the harvester and consumer ends of markets are affected by regulations, little has been done to understand the incentives of traders (i.e., intermediaries). We built a dynamic simulation model to support reduction in illegal wildlife trade within legal markets by focusing on incentives traders face to trade legal or illegal products. We used an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to infer illegal trading dynamics and parameters that might be unknown (e.g., price of illegal products). We showcased the utility of the approach with a small-scale fishery case study in Chile, where we disentangled within-year dynamics of legal and illegal trading and found that the majority (∼77%) of traded fish is illegal. We utilized the model to assess the effect of policy interventions to improve the fishery's sustainability and explore the trade-offs between ecological, economic, and social goals. Scenario simulations showed that even significant increases (over 200%) in parameters proxying for policy interventions enabled only moderate improvements in ecological and social sustainability of the fishery at substantial economic cost. These results expose how unbalanced trader incentives are toward trading illegal over legal products in this fishery. Our model provides a novel tool for promoting sustainable wildlife trade in data-limited settings, which explicitly considers traders as critical players in wildlife markets. Sustainable wildlife trade requires incentivizing legal over illegal wildlife trade and consideration of the social, ecological, and economic impacts of interventions. © 2021 The Authors.

"Water use conflicts under increasing water scarcity: The Yahagi river basin, central Japan","This chapter reviews a case study approach, the responses to water use conflicts that have emerged as a consequence of increased water use in Japan’s metropolises. Japan is blessed with rich water resources, with an average annual precipitation of about 1,800 mm. Urban domestic and industrial water demands in Japan grew at a phenomenal rate from rapid economic growth during the postwar period. Domestic water demands in the metropolises have continued to increase because of changes in lifestyle, coupled with rapid proliferation of the tertiary sector. Water use in the river basin has stabilized due to the slower growth of the regional economy, together with the widespread adoption of water-saving technologies. In terms of water use, the irrigation systems developed in the midstream of Yahagi were so extensive that almost the entire base flow of the main course of Yahagi was taken for agricultural use. © 1994 by Taylor and Francis.

Do physicians' attitudes toward prioritization predict poor-health patients' access to care?,"Physicians often face tight resource constraints, meaning they have to make trade-offs between which patients they care for and the amount of care received. Studies show that patients requiring many resources disproportionately suffer a loss of care when resources are constrained. This study uncovers whether physicians' attitudes toward prioritization of healthcare predicts poor-health patients' access to care. We combine unique survey data on Danish GPs' preferred prioritization principle with register data on their patients' contacts in general practice. We consider different types of contacts as the required effort could impact the need for prioritization. Our results show variation in GPs' prioritization principles, where a majority prefers a principle that may lead to an unequal distribution of services. We further find that GPs' attitudes toward prioritization predict some poor-health patients' access to general practice. GPs who state they prefer the principle of prioritizing patients in the poorest health state when resources tightened provide more contacts to poor-health patients. The additional contacts are typically high-effort contacts such as annual status meetings and home visits, but also low-effort contacts such as emails. Our findings indicate inequity in poor-health patients' access to care across general practices. © 2024 The Authors. Health Economics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Digital Sustainability: An Integrative Review and Research Impact Framework,"Digitalization has been hailed as a promising force for sustainability across environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Several impact-driven IS research streams have formed to address sustainability outcomes, namely: Green IT/IS, ICT4D, e-government, and the Dark Side of IS. Despite the growth in these streams, we posit that the unidimensional approach of the literature has limited the IS discipline's impact in addressing grand global challenges such as climate change and poverty. In this paper, we conduct an integrative review of the literature at the nexus of technology and sustainability outcomes in relation to technology's (1) magnitude of impact (direct, enabling, systemic) and (2) associated sustainability outcomes (environmental, social, economic). Building upon the recent conceptualization of digital sustainability in the IS literature, we advocate for a multidimensional and multidirectional research approach. We propose a research impact framework and outline directions for future research in the digital sustainability domain. © 2024 30th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2024.

Multidimensional urban exposure analysis of industrial chemical risk scenarios in mexican metropolitan areas,"Risk scenarios are caused by the convergence of a hazard with a potentially affected system in a specific place and time. One urban planning goal is to prevent environmental hazards, such as those generated by chemical accidents, from reaching human settlements, as they can cause public health issues. However, in many developing countries, due to their strategic positioning in global value chains, the quick and easy access to labor pools, and competitive production costs, urban sprawls have engulfed industrial areas, exposing residential conurbations to environmental hazards. This case study analyzes the spatial configuration of accidental chemical risk scenarios in three major Mexican metropolitan areas: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. Spatial analyses use an areal locations of hazardous atmosphere (ALOHA) dispersion model to represent the spatial effects of high-risk industrial activities in conurbations and the potentially affected populations vulnerable to chemical hazards. Complementary geostatistical correlation analyses use population data, marginalization indexes, and industrial clustering sectors to identify trends that can lead to comprehensive environmental justice approaches. In addition, the marginalization degree of inhabitants evaluates social inequalities concerning chemical risk scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

CONTRIBUTIONS OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE PROCESS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC INCLUSION IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA,"Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a long process of transition and social, political and economic reconfiguration followed, for the Republic of Moldova and the other states that were part of the Soviet bloc. Thus, political instability, corruption problems, recent migration, as well as security risks that have emerged more recently due to the war in Ukraine, come with a series of challenges for Moldovan society, and especially for the vulnerable segment. In this fluctuating and complex context, civil society plays an important role in terms of social and economic inclusion and implicitly in consolidating democracy and promoting European values at the level of society in the Republic of Moldova. Given that the process of socio-economic inclusion covers a wide range of areas (social protection, workforce, education, health, security, culture), we want to highlight the role that civil society plays in the process of catching up on socio-economic development in the Republic of Moldova. It is known that civil society has often substitute the lack of reaction or insufficient public policies of the state, but at the same time certain actions of civil society have determined constructive reactions in terms of creating or improving public policies or implementing impact projects that can prevent or solve these sensitive social challenges. Starting from the hypothesis that civil society contributes essentially to the inclusion process, we aim to analyze (through qualitative methods of analysis and process tracking data) some of the contributions of civil society in Moldova in terms of social and economic inclusion and its effects on the development of society. Our analysis will consider vulnerable groups (people with disabilities, NEETs, etc.) who have benefited from social inclusion through projects implemented by Civil Society Organizations (CSOs). © 2024, Civil Szemle Foundation.

"The Triple Challenge: Food Security and Vulnerabilities of Fishing and Farming Households in Situations Characterized by Increasing Conflict, Climate Shock, and Environmental Degradation","As conflict, climate shocks, and land/water degradation—the “triple challenge”—continue to exert increasing pressure upon fishing and farming livelihoods in many developing countries, a need exists to better understand how differential vulnerabilities undermine or amplify food security outcomes. In this study, we investigate how vulnerability to the “triple challenge” affect food security using an in-depth case study approach that merges social statistics and quantitative data analysis. We frame vulnerability using a combination of sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity, and operationalize food security using the FAO Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), which is an experience-based measure capturing the food access dimension of food security. We draw on survey data from 252 fishing and 251 farming households in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria and quantify the different components of vulnerability, deriving specific livelihood-related vulnerability scores. By merging and analyzing differential food security variables and vulnerability scores using ordered logistic models, we find that vulnerability to the “triple challenge” increases the probability of being in a severe food insecure state, particularly for households with a high dependency ratio. Parallel to this finding, we note that access to social capital and opportunities for livelihood diversification could drive gains in income, enhancing the capacity of households to attain a food-secure status in the face of recurrent instabilities. This study advances vulnerability literacy in food-insecure contexts and reveals ways to support populations on the frontline of interacting conflict, climate, and environmental crises. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

State of Social Marketing in Malaysia: Challenges and Reflections of a Multicultural Nation,"Background: Malaysia uniquely brings together a melting pot of cultures and history from the Malay Archipelago, China and India connected by the South China Sea. Historically, Malaysia’s role as a trade hub attracted diverse migrations, fostering its multi-ethnic identity. Post independence in 1957, Malaysia is governed by constitutional democracy, with a bicameral parliamentary system consisting of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) as the head of state. Amidst governance shifts and pandemic challenges, Malaysia aims for high-income status and ranks favourably in the Human Development Index. Primary social problems in the country: Educational emphasis, work life balance and environmental challenges prompt scrutiny of the education system’s role in shaping socio-economic landscapes. The emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines in education neglects active social engagement, hindering sufficient practical character development. Poor work-life balance and mental health issues have significantly impacted the productivity levels amongst Malaysians. Additionally, food waste, environmental pollution, and climate change present complex challenges, alongside inadequate concern and unsustainable practices contributing to environmental degradation and climate instability. Use of social marketing: Comprehension of social marketing among Malaysians remains incomplete, with a notable focus on public awareness rather than fostering behavioural change. The initiatives addressing the issues in Malaysia should emphasize policy changes and social marketing effectiveness. However, more sustained efforts are required to create more supportive environments to foster collaboration among stakeholders. Inculcating human rights behaviour requires integrating social awareness into education and empowering grassroots movements. Practical efforts on educating, raising awareness and long-term support requires strong public and private partnership for success. These endeavours underscore the importance of comprehensive awareness and action to achieve environmental harmony and societal well-being rooted in the philosophies of the Social Marketing framework and benchmarks. Academic Stakeholders and activities: Social marketing is often confused with social media marketing, thereby hindering its broader adoption. Academic endeavours publishing in the area seek to rectify this confusion and stress sustainability practices. Despite efforts from various stakeholders, presently there are no dedicated association nor academic program that functions solely on promoting social marketing concepts and ideals. Discussion and conclusion: Challenges and opportunities of social marketing in Malaysia reveals significant misconceptions which hinders effective behaviour change program implementation. Addressing these challenges involves a multi-faceted approach encompassing education reform, policy refinement, social media engagement, strategic partnerships and multicultural strategies. Collaboration between academia, government, and NGOs is essential for impactful societal change, necessitating structured educational courses and corporate involvement in sustainability initiatives. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Land Resources in Organic Agriculture: Trends and Challenges in the Twenty-First Century from Global to Croatian Contexts,"Organic agriculture (OA) is a continuously growing global concept that emphasizes the use of sustainable and environmentally-friendly practices. By adopting OA, it is possible to improve ecosystems services, increase biodiversity, decrease environmental pollution, reduce carbon footprints and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, generating food that is free from harmful residues of agrochemicals, thereby enhancing food safety and security. This study provides a comprehensive review of the latest insights on the global utilization of land resources in OA, focusing particularly on some EU countries that experienced a notable and rapid progress in organic farming during the past two decades. With negligible 1.6% (75 Mha) of global cropland is currently dedicated to OA, there is ample opportunity to expand the adoption of OA and realize its multi-beneficial potential for farmers (by premium prices), and consumers (by healthier and nutritious food). The importance of OA has been recognized by the most recent EU agro-environmental policies and green strategies, with an ambitious goal to have at least 25% of agroecosystems under organic management by 2030. Despite numerous financial supports and a multifold increase in OA land area, many member states are unlikely to achieve this goal, including Croatia, which currently has a share of only 8% (~109,000 ha) of lands in OA. Furthermore, converting conventional land to organic farming has not always led to an increase in value-added final OA products. EU policies related to OA have been focused on the area of land cultivated organically, rather than overall production performance, and financial subsidies have been essential to achieve this policy. Therefore, some of critical obstacles and challenges for OA under rising pressures due to global climate change, public health and geopolitical crises need to be managed by specifically designed policies and regulations, which would contribute to more sustainable OA, i.e., food safety and security. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Sustainable living in Africa: Case of water, sanitation, air pollution and energy","The study reviewed developmental challenges confronting African countries with specific reference to the availability of potable water, sanitation, energy, water and ambient air. It showed the conflict between the need to exploit environmental capital in order to keep up with the pace of human development activities and the need to utilize resources sustainably. Hitherto, the cost of this development has been at the expense of public health and cleaner environment. The outcome demonstrates the need for a change of approach in the way and manner that environmental resources are exploited for developmental purposes. Two concepts for addressing these problems were discussed. These are the ""soft path"" approach and the trialog model. The former places high priority on the proper use and management of existing infrastructure or resources rather than acquisition or exploitation of more infrastructure or resources. The latter concept addresses the principle of resource governance through the application of an understanding of the complex relationship between the main stakeholders-government, science, and society. Case studies on the practicality of these concepts were also highlighted and discussed. © 2014 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Built environment: Identifying, developing, and moving sustainable communities through renewable energy","Be it in our home or workplace, we are becoming increasingly accustomed to enjoying the maximum comfort levels. To make the indoor environment as per our suitability is a challenging task. Buildings are one of the most important contributors of pollutants and waste that affects the urban environment and contributes to adverse climatic conditions. Hence, exposure to indoor air pollution from the combustion of biofuels is a significant public health hazards, affecting the poor in both rural and urban communities in developing countries. Furthermore, the world's view of waste has changed dramatically in recent years and it is now seen as a source to feed the ever-growing demand for energy. Nowadays, emphasis is being laid upon utilisation of the surrounding energy from ground source and other renewable energy sources to stimulate alternative energy sources for heating and cooling of buildings. Exploitation of renewable energy sources and particularly ground heat in buildings can contribute towards reducing dependency on fossil fuels. Buildings where people work require more light and moreover, in the buildings where people live, the energy is used to maintain the lighting, temperature and proper ventilation. Hence, natural ventilation is rapidly becoming a significant part in the design strategy for non-domestic buildings. Ventilation has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of building operations, due to lower energy demand for cooling. A traditional, naturally ventilated building can readily provide a high ventilation rate. On the other hand, the mechanical ventilation systems are very expensive. Heating and energy consumption are interesting topics not just for the industry. Homeowners are also on the look-out for suitable technologies to keep overheads as low as possible and to save energy. The word 'green' designates more than a colour. It is a way of life, one that is becoming more and more common throughout the world. An interesting topic on 'sustainable technologies for a greener world' details what each technology is and how it achieves green goals. Recently, conventional chillers using absorption technology consume energy for hot water generators but absorption chillers carry no energy savings. Using energy efficiency and managing customer energy use has become an integral and valuable exercise. Green technology helps to sustain life on earth. This not only applies to humans but to plants, animals and the rest of the ecosystem. Energy prices and consumption will always be on an upward trajectory. In fact, energy costs have steadily risen over the last decade and are expected to continue as consumption grows. Efforts must be made to maximize the use of harmful chemicals responsible for ozone depletion and global warming. Additionally, heat pump applications are on the rise. Ammonia refrigerant is better suited for this type of work. All of us need energy for water heating, for air-conditioning in homes, offices and work rooms or manufacturing and industrial processes. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Assessment of site suitability for surface water retention and springshed rejuvenation using geospatial techniques: a case study of Mizoram State,"Mizoram, located in north-eastern India, is known for its rich biodiversity and hilly terrain. However, the state faces water scarcity issues due to irregular rainfall patterns, inadequate water storage infrastructure, and declining spring shed health. These factors have a significant impact on agricultural productivity, livelihoods, and overall socioeconomic development. To provide a sustainable solution for these challenges, a study has been done for Mizoram state. In this chapter, construction of surface water storage structures, such as reservoirs, tanks, and check dams, is proposed. Site suitability analysis for these structures has been done using geospatial techniques. These storage structures will help capture and store rainwater during the monsoon season, ensuring water availability during dry periods. Additionally, spring shed rejuvenation efforts will focus on protecting and restoring natural springs, which are essential water sources for communities. Results of the study show that western part of the state has the most suitable locations for the construction of the storage structures. A proposed check dam has been considered in the south-west of the state, which can carry the water in the order of 3.15 MCM. By implementing sustainable water management practices, this type of study will enhance water availability, support socioeconomic development, and improve the overall well-being of the communities. This, in turn, will contribute to improved agricultural productivity, food security, and economic growth. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Evaluation of climate change as a major determinant of crop yield improvement in Nigeria,"Climate change has adversely affected agricultural productivity leading to decline in food production. The influence of climate change on crops and livestock persists despite irrigation, improved plant and animal hybrids. The continued dependence of agricultural production on climatic factors and the relative dependence of human existence on agricultural products create the need for a comprehensive consideration of the relationship between climate and crop production. This study measured the relationship between annual maize/yam yield as dependent variable and seasonal rainfall as independent variables in four states in Nigeria. It has been proven in the past that yearly rainfall value has no influence on annual crop yield, but seasonal or monthly rainfall does. There is a positive and significant relationship between summed up rainfalls of June/July/August and annual maize yields for the thirty-five years under study. The bi-monthly rainfall values did not influence a major part of total annual maize yield, as it records weak relationship with annual maize yield. On the other hand, bi-monthly rainfall values (May/June and July/August) have positive and significant relationship with annual yam yield. The first quarter- March/April/May rainfall values for each of the states have a positive and significant relationship with annual yam yield. This implies that the rainfall value for this quarter is very essential for annual yam yield for each of the states. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Evaluation of agricultural vulnerability to drought weather in different locations of Venezuela,"In recent decades the recurrent increase and distribution of global drought has resulted in its effects on the population and biodiversity in general considered as one of the greatest disasters due to the magnitude of its negative impacts, whose agricultural sector, yields, productivity and harvested areas have been significantly reduced, affecting food security and food sovereignty. The aim of this research was to evaluate the agricultural vulnerability to meteorological drought in 11 stations of the Agrometeorological Station of the National Institute of Agricultural Research (INIA), distributed in Anzoategui, Aragua, Guarico, Lara, Merida, Miranda, Portuguesa, Tachira, Yaracuy and Zulia states of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. For this purpose, the agricultural vulnerability index (AV) was used, consisting on the average of four sub-indexes such as: land tenure fragmentation, rurality, irrigation/dry balance and agriculture intensity. Depending on the analysis of agricultural vulnerability, the seasons seem to be categorized mostly in the range of moderately vulnerable. In the case of the municipality Turen, located in the western plains, the effects of this phenomenon increased in terms of their vulnerability to socioeconomic activities and the land treatment under a capitalized agriculture integrated into the national market. For the rest of the localities, the vulnerability was linked to the social structure and productive strategies of a sector that was not integrated with the recent dynamics of agrifood systems. The contribution generated in this study represents a guiding element that stimulates the creation of a drought risk management scheme in Venezuela. © 2017, Universidad del Zulia.

"Net Zero and Natural Resources Law: Sovereignty, Security, and Solidarity in the Clean Energy Transition","States, corporations, and other actors worldwide have committed to measures aimed at bringing down global emissions to net zero by the year 2060 or earlier. While the need for a clean energy transition is clear, incoherently designed transition programs can pose complex environmental, social, and governance risks, including legal liability and protracted disputes. At the same time, the rush for minerals needed to manufacture clean energy technologies raises fundamental questions-most crucially, how to ensure the exploration and development of energy transition minerals in a manner that does not exacerbate resource conflicts, resource nationalism, human rights violations, protectionism, energy insecurity, social exclusions, and inequity, especially in conflict-affected and high-risk regions. By studying the legal and regulatory systems of Africa, Asia, Europe, Australasia, and North and South America through the themes of sovereignty, security and solidarity, Net Zero and Natural Resources Law provides an in-depth discussion of tools and techniques for addressing the legal and contract risks relating to the clean energy transition. This book offers a comprehensive and authoritative account of the nature, scope, and guiding principles of natural resources law and policy in a net zero era. Consideration is given to the integrated resource governance roadmap that is needed to improve coherence and coordination in the design, financing, and implementation of energy transition programs across the entire natural resource value chain. © International Bar Association 2024.

Climate smart agriculture? Adaptation strategies of traditional agriculture to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa,"Introduction: Sub-Saharan Africa faces increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather patterns due to climate change, posing significant threats to food security and rural livelihoods. Traditional agriculture, deeply rooted in the region's history and culture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study investigates the adaptation strategies of traditional agricultural farmers to climate change using southeast Nigeria as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 75 farmer group leaders in the study region. Cross-sectional data were collected through semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated matrix. Results: Findings showed that farmers rely on face-to-face discussions with neighbors (76.0%), fellow farmers (66.7%), and radio (54.7%) as their primary sources of information on climate change. Results showed that traditional adaptation practices such as use of organic manure ((Formula presented.) = 3.89), traditional organic composting ((Formula presented.) = 3.80), afforestation ((Formula presented.) = 3.71), agroforestry ((Formula presented.) = 3.61) were the topmost traditional agricultural practices use to cushion the effect of climate change. Conserving the overall soil health, soil moisture retention, reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining crop productivity were the major reasons for using the traditional approaches. Climate-induced drought and high cost of accessing weather information ((Formula presented.) = 1.93), and inadequate funding ((Formula presented.) = 1.92), among others were the key constraints to adaptation. Discussion: Results showed that farmers prioritize agronomic manipulation and integrated research approaches as key strategies to adapting traditional agriculture to climate anomalies. Although farmers used their indigenous practices, continuous learning and improvement through capacity-building workshops and progress monitoring are essential for effective climate change adaptation. Policymakers should invest in promoting indigenous knowledge, provide access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure, promote climate-smart agricultural practices and foster collaborative research as the cornerstone for sustainable rural development.

Climate impacts on palm oil yields in the Nigerian Niger Delta,"Palm oil production has increased in recent decades and is estimated to increase further globally. The optimal role of palm oil production, however, is controversial because of conflicts with other important land uses and ecosystem services. Local conditions and climate change affect resource competition and the desirability of palm oil production in the Niger Delta, Nigeria. The objectives of this study are to (1) establish a better understanding of the existing yield potentials of oil palm areas that could be used for integrated assessment models, (2) quantify for the first time uncertainties in yield potentials arising from the use of climate output data from different Global Circulation Models (GCM's) with varied West African Monsoon (WAM) system representations forced to the same Regional Climate Models (RCM's). We use the biophysical simulation model APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator) to simulate spatially variable impacts of climate change on oil palm yield over the Nigerian Niger Delta. Our results show that the impact of climate change on oil palm yield is considerable across our study region. The yield differences between the IPCC RCPs were small. The net impact of climate change on oil palm is positive and is dynamically inconsistent. There is no significant change in the simulated yield arising from the differences in the forcing's data. We found the most effective strategy for oil palm yield optimization under climate change to be shifting of sowing dates and introduction of irrigation. © 2017",Not About Sufficiency
Nature-based solutions for water resource management in Africa's arid and sem-arid lands (ASALs): A systematic review of existing interventions,"Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) in Africa, covering 66 % of the continent and are home to around 200 million people, face significant water scarcity challenges due to harsh climatic conditions. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness, socio-economic impacts, and implementation challenges of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for water resource management in these regions. Analysing 9906 research articles narrowed to 143 studies, the review identified critical NbS interventions, including water conservation, soil moisture and conservation, water harvesting, conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and afforestation. The studies focused on biophysical aspects (31 %), socio-economic issues (39 %), or both (30 %), with an emphasis on water quantity (96 %) over quality (3 %). These interventions' direct (43 %) and indirect (55 %) impacts were examined. Findings show that 52 % of the studies meet all effectiveness criteria: socio-economic benefits, sustainable resource use, resource enhancement and conservation, and infrastructure sustainability. Stakeholder engagement in co-designing NbS significantly enhances their effectiveness and the integration of indigenous knowledge. Geographic distribution highlights concentrated research in eastern, southern, and western Africa, particularly in Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa, with underrepresentation in northern and central regions. The review identifies gaps in water quality interventions and calls for more comprehensive approaches. The review highlights NbS' potential to improve water availability, ecosystem resilience, and socio-economic development in ASALs. However, challenges such as limited stakeholder involvement, inadequate integration of indigenous knowledge, and regional research disparities need addressing. The study recommends prioritising the participation of local communities and stakeholders from the planning stages to implementation to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of future NbS projects. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptation of Fishing Communities to Climate-Driven Shifts in Target Species,"Climate change is causing shifts in marine species’ distributions, meaning that the species’ targeted by fishing communities might no longer be available in their historical fishing areas. This Perspective discusses the types of actions that fishery social-ecological systems can undertake as a response to climate-induced shifts in marine species distribution. Individuals, groups, and institutions cope, adapt, and transform in response to habitat and species shifts, and policy interventions can increase resilience and avoid maladaptation. © 2020 The Authors; Climate change is causing shifts in marine species’ distributions, disrupting fishers and fishing communities and threatening food security. These changes affect all fishing activities, from small-scale to industrial fishing, and have implications for livelihoods, economies, and society along the entire seafood supply chain. Understanding fisheries as social-ecological systems (SESs) that include dynamic responses and feedbacks for the targeted stocks, the fishers, and the fishing industry provides an essential standpoint for thinking about fisheries’ adaptation to climate change. In this Perspective, we briefly summarize the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of target species’ distribution shifts. We propose using a resilience perspective where fishery SESs can respond to climate changes by maintaining, coping, adapting, and/or transforming the system. In this context, we identify what specific actions by individuals, groups, and institutions allow the fishery system to respond in these ways and discuss policy solutions to allow for adaptation and transformation to shifting species distributions. © 2020 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Interrogating the Role of Colonialism and Deculturation in the Sustained Underdevelopment of the Global South,"The persistent underdevelopment in the Global South which includes parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America is a major concern. Despite the latent human and natural resources in these regions, they are laden with persistent socioeconomic challenges that prevent them from developing to their full potential. This chapter investigates the underlay and intricate dynamics of the persistent underdevelopment of the Global South, focusing specifically on the roles played by colonialism and deculturation. The spotlight of this study is beamed on two countries across the regions, namely Nigeria and Indonesia representing key states of the Global South. Relying on post-colonial and critical race theoretical frameworks, the chapter engages literature review, historical evaluation, case study analysis, and focused group discussions methods in data gathering. Data obtained were subjected to thematic and content analysis. The authors argue that colonial powers, through exploitation, extraction, and cultural imposition, laid the groundwork for entrenched patterns of underdevelopment in the Global South. They recommend decolonial strategies that prioritises cultural revival, awaken indigenous epistemologies, and empower colonially oppressed people in the regions. Through insights generated, the chapter hopes to inform policy recommendations and interventions aimed at addressing structural disparities and advancing sustainable development in the Global South. It also hopes to contribute to larger movements for social justice, equity, and empowerment in the regions and beyond. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Hebatallah Adam and Ravinder Rena individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change and the temple of sustainable development,"For many poor and marginalised groups living in the developing world, the notion of sustainable development as a realisable working concept remains a far off dream. This is because up till now the developed countries have not shown the political will to implement long-lasting and sustainable poverty alleviation measures to raise living standards for the world's poorest societies. The use of the concept also seems inappropriate with respect to communities and systems faced with the devastating effect of frequent or prolonged climate hazards. Evidence from this article shows that such communities, wheher existing in the flood plains of England and Wales (flood hazard) or along the hurricane coast of eastern India (storm hazard), struggle to maintain their lifestyles and standards of living. An important issue here concerns the availability of physical, economic and institutional resources employed to combat the effects of the climate hazard and to reduce the vulnerability of high-risk communities and groups exposed to them. This article shows that when these resources are lacking, the adaptive capacities of local communities to cope with the effects of severe climate impacts declines. The result is that community development levels either suffer a long-term fall, especially if the climate event is frequent or prolonged enough, or are maintained at a level much lower than they would otherwise be in the absence of the external climate stimuli. If the principles of sustainable development are to be realised for such hazard-prone communities, then the inclusion of climate risks in the design and implementation of development programmes is a necessary first step.",Not About Sufficiency
Toward Understanding the Impacts of Air Pollution,"This chapter aims to highlight the impacts of air pollution. Air pollution is a pervasive environmental problem with significant implications for human health, ecosystems, and global climate. Examining the impacts of poor air quality on society will help develop a comprehensive understanding of air pollution and work toward a cleaner and healthier environment for all. Addressing air quality issues is essential for safeguarding public health, protecting the environment, promoting economic prosperity, fostering social equity, and advancing global cooperation. By implementing effective pollution control measures, investing in clean technologies, and adopting sustainable practices, human societies can create a healthier, more resilient, and sustainable future for current and future generations. Air pollution originates from a wide range of sources, including industrial emissions, transportation activities, agricultural practices, natural phenomena, and indoor combustion. Each source contributes to the complex mixture of pollutants in the air, affecting air quality, human health, ecosystems, and the climate. Some sustainable strategies for addressing air pollution include regulatory measures, technological advancements, and sustainable practices; we can improve air quality, protect public health, and safeguard the environment for current and future generations. Air pollution dispersion is influenced by a multitude of mechanisms, including atmospheric stability, wind patterns, topography, and atmospheric reactions. There is a need to consider the complex interplay of these dispersion mechanisms to understand the impacts of air pollution as well as address the challenges of air pollution, protect public health, assess air quality, predict pollutant concentrations, develop effective pollution control measures, and promote sustainable air quality management practices. The diverse impacts of air pollution on human health, the environment, climate change, and socioeconomic factors underscore the urgent need to address this global challenge through comprehensive strategies and collaborative efforts. Understanding the multifaceted effects of air pollution and the interconnected nature of its impacts can help prioritize pollution prevention, emission reductions, sustainable development practices, and public health protection measures to safeguard the well-being of present and future generations. Addressing the impacts of air pollution requires a coordinated approach involving government policies, industry regulations, scientific research, public awareness campaigns, and community engagement to create a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable environment for all. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of the oil boom on the lives of people living in the Albertine Graben region of Uganda,"We consider the impacts of the development of oil resources (exploration and extraction) on the lives and livelihoods of people living in the Albertine Graben region of Uganda. These impacts are both positive and negative and include: employment opportunities; infrastructure development; project induced displacement and resettlement; in-migration and influx; inflation; reduction of food security; restrictions on access to fishing, firewood and herbs for cooking and medicinal purposes; inadequate compensation; land grabbing; prostitution; environmental degradation; annoyance and inconvenience; fear and anxiety; and changes to their communities, livelihoods and landscape. In-depth interviews were carried out with key informants, including with leaders at the village, parish, sub-county, and district levels in Uganda. Focus group discussions and participant observation were also used. We argue that there is need for all stakeholders – especially the government of Uganda, oil companies, the local communities, the Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom, and civil society organisations – to collaborate in order to address the deficiencies in the development of oil resources and the region, and to create the conditions needed to avoid the resource curse and associated Dutch disease and Nigerian disease, and instead to achieve a social licence to operate for oil development in the region. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Overview of biodiesel combustion in mitigating the adverse impacts of engine emissions on the sustainable human–environment scenario,"Air pollution is a precursor to many health issues such as difficulty breathing, asthma, lung and heart diseases, and cancer. This study presents a concise view of biodiesel combustion in mitigating pollutant emissions which are generated by the combustion of fossil fuels, thereby eliminating the negative effects on human health and the environment. Gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide are found to be major exhaust emissions from vehicles running on fossil fuels. Excessive exposure to these pollutants was found to be a precursor to reductions in life expectancy via health complications in humans. Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector were found to be 24% of total annual emissions, 74.5% of which came from the combustion of fossil fuel in road vehicles. Biodiesel combustion in vehicular engines is established to be a control technology in reducing gaseous pollutants toward building a sustainable and healthy human–environment scenario. The emissions reduction index from the United States National Biodiesel Board showed that the combustion of biodiesel wholly as a transportation fuel decreased total hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon, and sulfur emissions by 67%, 80%, 48%, and 100%, respectively. Evaluation of emission results from topical literature strongly suggests that the use of biodiesel is effective in the reduction in pollutants, which is beneficial to human and environmental sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

Societal lifecycle costs of cars with alternative fuels/engines,"Effectively addressing concerns about air pollution (especially health impacts of small-particle air pollution), climate change, and oil supply insecurity will probably require radical changes in automotive engine/fuel technologies in directions that offer both the potential for achieving near-zero emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases and a diversification of the transport fuel system away from its present exclusive dependence on petroleum.The basis for comparing alternative automotive engine/fuel options in evolving toward these goals in the present analysis is the ""societal lifecycle cost"" of transportation, including the vehicle first cost (assuming large-scale mass production), fuel costs (assuming a fully developed fuel infrastructure), externality costs for oil supply security, and damage costs for emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases calculated over the full fuel cycle.Several engine/fuel options are considered- including current gasoline internal combustion engines and a variety of advanced lightweight vehicles: Internal combustion engine vehicles fueled with gasoline or hydrogen; internal combustion engine/hybrid electric vehicles fueled with gasoline, compressed natural gas, Diesel, Fischer-Tropsch liquids or hydrogen; and fuel cell vehicles fueled with gasoline, methanol or hydrogen (from natural gas, coal or wind power). To account for large uncertainties inherent in the analysis (for example in environmental damage costs, in oil supply security costs and in projected mass-produced costs of future vehicles), lifecycle costs are estimated for a range of possible future conditions.Under base-case conditions, several advanced options have roughly comparable lifecycle costs that are lower than for today's conventional gasoline internal combustion engine cars, when environmental and oil supply insecurity externalities are counted-including advanced gasoline internal combustion engine cars, internal combustion engine/hybrid electric cars fueled with gasoline, Diesel, Fischer-Tropsch liquids or compressed natural gas, and hydrogen fuel cell cars. The hydrogen fuel cell car stands out as having the lowest externality costs of any option and, when mass produced and with high valuations of externalities, the least projected lifecycle cost. Particular attention is given to strategies that would enhance the prospects that the hydrogen fuel cell car would eventually become the Car of the Future, while pursuing innovations relating to options based on internal combustion engines that would both assist a transition to hydrogen fuel cell cars and provide significant reductions of externality costs in the near term. © 2002 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental impact assessment for a meta-model-based food-energy-water-nexus system,"A growing global population uses essential resources such as food, energy, and water to drive economic growth. However, population growth, urbanization, and human activities strain these limited resources, resulting in serious harm, particularly from global warming and climate change. Sustainable resource allocation in the Nexus system is required for improved resource security. This issue is essential since it impacts resource management, sustainability, and the environment. This research proposes developing an integrated assessment model (IAM) for the FEW-N system. The system undergoes a comprehensive evaluation that considers sustainability, economics, social aspects, and the environment. This evaluation combines an environmental impact assessment with a meta-model-based approach to the FEW-N system. A multi-objective optimization model is utilized to optimize the system with three key targets: maximum economic benefit, positive environmental impact, and least negative environmental impact. The findings show significant improvements in resource security within a community-level FEW-N system, with the Nexus system sectors contributing to both food and energy security. Greenhouse farming, rainfed farming, and irrigated farming supply 55.6%, 11.9%, and 32.5% of food security, respectively. Similarly, bioenergy, solar/wind hybrid renewable energy, and hydropower contribute 52.7%, 40.1%, and 7.2% of total energy security, respectively. The FEW-N system optimizes resource allocation for sustainability, reliability, and efficiency while emphasizing the specific contributions of diverse sectors to food and energy security. These findings provide critical insights for making educated resource allocation policy decisions in South Africa, emphasizing balancing societal, economic, and environmental factors.

Implications of the Ecosystem-Based Approach to Wetlands Management on the Kenyan Coast,"The evolution of the concept of the ecosystem approach has heralded innovations in the thinking on, and rules for, the management of natural resources. As it is understood today, the ecosystem approach emerged from the requirements of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)1 and its implementation has been intertwined with that of the CBD. The approach requires integration in the management of the environment and natural resources and eschews an approach which is purely sectoral. Wetlands provide an important lens through which to assess the application of the ecosystem approach to the management of coastal ecosystems. Together with forests, wetlands are the most important, yet most seriously threatened, ecosystems in the world.2 Indeed, the degradation and loss of wetlands is occurring more rapidly than that of forests or any other ecosystem.3 The reason could be that forests have always been viewed as a useful ecosystem, providing the source of trees and related products and serving important functions in society.4 In contrast, the utility of wetlands to society has not always been accepted or appreciated. Indeed, historically, wetlands were viewed as useless areas,5 the utility of which required their conversion to more productive uses such as agriculture. This resulted in wetlands being referred to in certain quarters as ‘wastelands’.6 Part of the reason why the importance of wetlands was not appreciated, and efforts spent only in their conversion to other uses, was the failure to accurately assess and value their economic utility. Decision-makers, developers and land-use planners have long perceived little economic benefit to be gained from conserving wetlands and few economic costs have been attached to their degradation.7 However, over time, the utility and importance of wetlands have been understood, and the international community has responded by making efforts for their conservation.8 Nevertheless, despite developments in the appreciation and valuation of the importance of wetlands and the need for their conservation, they still continue to be degraded and/or lost. Whilst certain pressures on wetlands arise from natural causes (such as droughts which affect community migration patterns), it is human activities that have significantly altered the rate and nature of wetlands change.9 Even today, the rate and scale of wetlands loss and/or degradation10 has continued to increase.11 Wetlands, however, are amongst the most precious natural resources on earth12 and the most productive and valuable ecosystems in the world.13 They have useful attributes and perform important functions for humanity. In terms of functions, wetlands play a key role in hydrological balance. They act as a storage of water supply and regulate the water table through the maintenance and recharge of surface and underground water, supply; discharge of groundwater, and storage of floodwaters in flood plains. Other functions include water purification, control of soil erosion and climate stability.14 Wetlands also serve as habitat for many species. They provide an important reservoir of genetic material and are also a source of rich cultural heritage. In Kenya, as elsewhere, wetlands support livelihoods both directly and indirectly through supporting necessary ecological functions, such as provision of water, waste water treatment, maintenance of hydrological cycles, and prevention of storm damage and erosion. In some places they also serve unique cultural functions. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment carried out between 2002 and 2005 remains the most comprehensive account to date of the state of the world’s ecosystems and the required strategies for their conservation and sustainable use.15 The report is famous for the linkages it demonstrated between ecosystems and human well-being through what it called ecosystem services, which it categorised into provisioning services, regulating services, social services and supporting services.16 Several thematic reports were also prepared in association with the Assessment, one of which focused on marine and coastal ecosystems.17 That report18 highlighted the importance of marine and coastal ecosystems, stating that the services they provide include supply of food, fuel wood, energy resources, natural products, and bioprospecting, shoreline stabilization, flood prevention, storm protection, climate regulation, hydrological services, nutrient regulation, carbon sequestration, detoxification of polluted waters, waste disposal, culture, tourism, and recreation, habitat provision, nutrient cycling, primary productivity, and soil formation.19 Governance of oceans and coasts is best understood as the process for policy making by competent institutions in a system of negotiation between nested governmental institutions at several levels (international, national, regional and local), on the one hand, and market parties and civil society organizations on the other.20 Only an integrated approach can help resolve the governance challenges of the oceans and the coast which: for the most part, have been related to the intensifying nature of human interactions with the oceans and coasts and the inability of governance institutions to adapt. Governance processes have in the past primarily focused on regulating individual sectors, ignoring interactions between sectors and ocean ecosystems. While governance effectiveness varies, based on institutional architecture, often specific to a given place, sociopolitical context, legal and policy regime, ignoring interactions among sectors and their combined impacts on the coastal and marine ecosystems, has placed at risk the heritage, livelihoods, and cultures of coastal communities that rely on healthy marine environments.21 In 2010 Kenya adopted a new Constitutional architecture that places a premium on sustainable development as a key governance imperative and requires public participation in all processes. Based on this development, the present chapter assesses the extent to which Kenya’s legal framework for management of wetlands in the coastal region adopts the ecosystem approach and whether it enhances the conservation and wise use of wetlands and thus aligns to the constitutional dictates of sustainable development. The main argument that the paper advances is that both in law and practice, the move towards ecosystem approach is slow and fledgling. The management approach is still characterised by sector specific focus, governance overlaps and legal gaps. However, the adoption of a ‘green constitution’22 and the incorporation of the ecosystem approach in the National Environment Policy in 2014 provide a basis for sustainable management of wetlands in the Kenyan coast. © Collins Odote, 2019",Not About Sufficiency
Water scarcity in the Arabian Peninsula and socio-economic implications,"The Arabian Gulf, one of the driest parts of the world, is already passing the water scarcity line as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). The scarcity of renewable water resources and the growing discrepancy between demand and supply of water is a major challenge. Water scarcity is further worsened by rapidly growing demands due to rapid population growth, unsustainable consumption, climate change and weak management institutions and regulations. Water scarcity erodes the socio-economic sustainability of the communities that depend on the depleting storage. In this paper, an analysis of the water security situation within the Arabian Gulf region and the consequent socio-economic implications is presented. © 2016, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Women and food security in Africa: The double burden in addressing gender equality and environmental sustainability,"Over the years, the role African women play in the production, accessibility and utilization of food, and ensuring environmental sustainability, is not adequately recognized, and the needed support to scale their productivity remains limited. This is a result of traditional beliefs and cultural practices where gender norms alienate women from owning land, expanding agricultural processes, obtaining adequate education, securing representation in political and leadership positions to impact decisions that affect them, and contributing to the socio-economic development of their communities. All these occur amidst a backdrop of climate change and the double burden natural disasters bring about on women's sustenance and livelihood. This chapter discusses women's contribution to food security in Africa, the challenges and limitations encountered, and innovations employed over the years, highlighting the need for a gendered perspective on food security and environmental sustainability in the African continent. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Rethinking Development in Latin America,"Latin American countries face a crossroad that demands profound change in their development paradigm. In the last four decades economic growth, investment, and productivity have shown poor performance. This has made it impossible to break with the productive heterogeneity that characterises the region and its dependence on low value-added productive sectors and commodity-dependent export structures. Although there has been a positive advance in human development, high levels of inequality, poverty, social exclusion, and high labour market informality have been persistent in the countries of the region. Added to these structural problems is the need to face climate change, that has important distributive and social effects and requires a significant amount of investment in adaption and mitigation a will require a change in the development paradigm. A fiscal sustainability framework will be essential to ensure the viability of the public spending required to promote structural change. The framework should prioritise domestic resource mobilisation, through public revenues, which have historically been insufficient to meet the demands for public spending. © 2023 Human Development and Capability Association.",Not About Sufficiency
Monetary politics: Exchange rate cooperation in the European Union,"A single currency--and the necessary prior condition of exchange rate cooperation and the stabilization of exchange rates--has been an elusive goal of many European leaders for more than twenty years. While much of the literature on exchange rate cooperation within the European Union focuses on the integration of national economies as the driving force, Thomas Oatley draws on public choice models to develop an explanation of exchange rate cooperation based on domestic politics. The author then tests hypotheses derived from this model in a detailed consideration of the various efforts to stabilize currencies since the 1970s. Oatley argues that monetary policy has distributional effects and is used by policy makers to achieve domestic policy goals. Thus domestic politics plays an important role in defining the approach leaders take to monetary integration. Oatley suggests that leaders supported the creation of the European Monetary System because governments saw a link to the Bundesbank as a useful instrument to help slow the growth of wages, redistribute income from labor to capital, and achieve domestic stabilization. The later collapse of the System reflected the unwillingness on the part of many leaders to continue to follow the Bundesbank’s lead as well as the Bundesbank’s own reservations about monetary integration. Given the rising strife in countries such as France over the domestic costs of monetary integration, Oatley’s domestic politics explanation will be useful in understanding the continued efforts of European policy makers to work towards an integrated currency. This book should appeal to political scientists and economists interested in international cooperation, the European Union and exchange rate systems. © by the University of Michigan 1997.

Socioeconomic determinants of respiratory health in patients with cystic fibrosis: implications for treatment strategies,"Introduction: Great variation exists in the progression and outcomes of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, due to both genetic and environmental influences. Social determinants mediate environmental exposures and treatment success; people with CF from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds have worse health and die younger than those in more advantaged positions. Areas covered: This paper reviews the literature on the mechanisms that are responsible for generating and sustaining disparities in CF health, and the ways by which social determinants translate into health advantages or disadvantages in people with CF. The authors make recommendations for addressing social risk factors in CF clinical practice. Expert opinion: Socioeconomic factors are not dichotomous and their impact is felt at every step of the social ladder. CF care programs need to adopt a systematic protocol to screen for health-related social risk factors, and then connect patients to available resources to meet individual needs. Considerations such as daycare, schooling options, living and working conditions, and opportunities for physical exercise and recreation as well as promotion of self-efficacy are often overlooked. In addition, advocacy for changes in public policies on health insurance, environmental regulations, social welfare, and education would all help address the root causes of CF health inequities. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Diversity and heterogeneity of smallholder vegetable farming systems and their impact on food security and income in Malawi,"Household food security and income play central roles in sustainable development at the global, national, and local levels. Smallholder vegetable farming systems are widely regarded as crucial contributors to enhancing household food security and income in the developing world. Comprehensive whole-farm analysis of smallholder vegetable farming systems points out greater diversity and heterogeneity driven by interactions of socioeconomic and biophysical factors such as land profiles, land use, farm assets, enterprise income, off/non-farm activities, and household structure and expenditure. However, three distinct farm typologies exist (Resource and Livelihood Constrained Off-farm Dependent/Supplemented–RLCOD farmers, Resource and Livelihood Abundant and Commercial Oriented–RLACO farmers, and Medium Resources and Livelihoods Constrained Market Oriented–MRLCMO farmers), exhibiting significant differences and variability in structural and functional factors. The production of maize, groundnuts, soybean, and bean crops remains the primary source of livelihood for all farm typologies. Similarly, vegetable production is vital for farmers’ livelihoods in all farm types, yielding more income than food needs. However, both crop and vegetable productivity and production are still low and below the national and potential target across farm typologies. Small-scale irrigation offers one alternative solution in the context of increasing climate change. Small livestock (chickens, goats, and pigs) play a significant role in the livelihood of vegetable farmers despite their low productivity. Disparities exist across farm typologies in available arable and irrigable land, available household labor, capacity to hire additional labor, farm assets, and inputs, as well as participation in off-farm and non-labor-farm activities. While vegetable production and its proportion sold and earned income emerge as critical factors affecting household food accessibility and acquisition, additional factors such as crop production, proportion of crops sold, daily food expenditure, livestock income, and TLU significantly influence household access for different farm typologies, requiring consideration to achieve food security in vegetable farming systems.

Smallholder perceptions and communication gaps shape East African riparian ecosystems,"Human livelihood needs and nature conservation often contradict. Yet, healthy ecosystems are crucial for human livelihood quality. The semi-arid regions of East Africa suffer under demographic pressure and soil depletion. Ecosystem degradation becomes particularly visible along rivers in semiarid regions of south-east Kenya, where former pristine riparian forests have been transformed into agricultural fields and settlements with negative effects on ecosystem services. In this study, we aim to understand how local smallholders perceive the challenges for the riparian ecosystems and what factors affect their engagement in environmental conservation. We surveyed about 200 farmers and performed expert interviews with representatives from governmental institutions from the field of land- and resource management along Nzeeu River in south-east Kenya. We assessed the level of education, land use practices, environmental knowledge, attitudes and the willingness to contribute to nature conservation. We tested for spatial bias to understand smallholders’ perceptions on environmental challenges. Our data show that land division due to inheritance is not perceived as a problem by the farmers. However, owners holding < 1 ha of land property are less willing to spare some of their land for conservation, as opposed to those holding land plots above this size. Despite a high level of general willingness to conserve ecosystems, our data underline that local people hardly actively engage in conservation action. Furthermore, our data indicate a communication gap between local smallholders and regional governmental officers as well as overconfidence in mass media through the radio which can contradict successful adoption of pro-environment behavior. Sustainable land management in our study area is not a matter of education, but depends from the size of land property. There is an urgent need to bridge this communication gap, as a prerequisite to improve sustainable land management. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
The Zimbabwe crisis and the provision of social services: Health and education,"Historically, health care in Zimbabwe was provided primarily to cater to colonial administrators and the expatriate, with separate care or second-provision made for Africans. There was no need for legislation to guarantee its provision to the settler community. To address the inequities in health that had existed prior to 1980, at independence, Zimbabwe adopted the concept of Equity in Health and Primary Health Care. Initially, this resulted in the narrowing of the gap between health provision in rural areas and urban areas. Over the years, however, there have been clear indications of growing inequities in health provision and health care as a result of mainly Economic Structural Adjustment Policies (ESAP), 1991-1995, and health policy changes. Infant and child mortality have been worsened by the impact of HIV/AIDS and reduced access to affordable essential health care. For example, life expectancy at birth was 56 in the 1980s, increased to 60 in 1990 and is now about 43. Morbidity (diseases) and mortality (death rates) trends in Zimbabwe show that the population is still affected by the traditional preventable diseases and conditions that include nutritional deficiencies, communicable diseases, pregnancy and childbirth conditions and the conditions of the new born. The deterioration of the Zimbabwean health services sector has also partially been due to increasing shortages of qualified personnel. The public sector has been operating with only 19 per cent staff since 2000. Many qualified and competent health workers left the country because of the unfavourable political environment. The health system in Zimbabwe has been operating under a legal and policy framework that in essence does not recognize the right to health. Neither the pre-independence constitution nor the Lancaster House constitution, which is the current Constitution of Zimbabwe, made specific provisions for the right to health. Progress made in the 1980s characterized by adequate financing of the health system and decentralized health management and equity of health services between urban and rural areas, which saw dramatic increases in child survival rates and life expectancy, was, unfortunately, not consolidated. As of 2000 per capita health financing stood at USD 8.55 as compared to USD 23.6, which had been recommended by the Commission of Review into the Health Sector in 1997. At the beginning of 2008 it had been dramatically further eroded and stood at only USD 0.19 leading to the collapse of the health system. Similarly, education in Zimbabwe, in addition to the changes it has undergone during the different periods since attainment of independence, also went through many phases during the colonial period. From 1962 up until 1980, the Rhodesia Front government catered more for the European child. Luckily, some mission schools that had been established earlier kept on expanding taking in African children who could proceed with secondary education (high school education). Inequity in education existed when the ZANU-PF government came into power in 1980. It took aggressive and positive steps to redress the inequalities that existed in the past. Unfortunately, the government did not come up with an education policy or philosophy in spite of massive expansion and investment. The government had cut its expenditure on education because of economic and political instability. This has happened particularly in rural areas, where teachers have left the teaching profession. © 2010 SAGE Publications.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards Resilient Agriculture to Hostile Climate Change in the Sahel Region: A Case Study of Machine Learning-Based Weather Prediction in Senegal,"To ensure continued food security and economic development in Africa, it is very important to address and adapt to climate change. Excessive dependence on rainfed agricultural production makes Africa more vulnerable to climate change effects. Weather information and services are essential for farmers to more effectively survive the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events due to climate change. Weather information is important for resource management in agricultural production and helps farmers plan their farming activities in advance. Machine Learning is one of the technologies used in agriculture for weather forecasting and crop disease detection among others. The objective of this study is to develop Machine Learning-based models adapted to the context of daily weather forecasting for Rainfall, Relative Humidity, and Maximum and Minimum Temperature in Senegal. In this study, we made a comparison of ten Machine Learning Regressors with our Ensemble Model. These models were evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error and Coefficient of Determination. The results show that the Ensemble Model performs better than the ten base models. The Ensemble Model results for each parameter are as follows; Relative Humidity: Mean Absolute Error was 4.0126, Mean Squared Error was 29.9885, Root Mean Squared Error was 5.4428 and Coefficient of Determination was 0.9335. For Minimum Temperature: Mean Absolute Error was 0.7908, Mean Squared Error was 1.1329, Root Mean Squared Error was 1.0515 and Coefficient of Determination was 0.9018. For Maximum Temperature: Mean Absolute Error was 1.2515, Mean Squared Error was 2.8038, Root Mean Squared Error was 1.6591 and Coefficient of Determination was 0.8205. For Rainfall: Mean Absolute Error was 0.2142, Mean Squared Error was 0.1681, Root Mean Squared Error was 0.4100 and Coefficient of Determination was 0.7733. From the present study, it has been observed that the Ensemble Model is a feasible model to be used for Rainfall, Relative Humidity, and Maximum and Minimum Temperature forecasting. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"What lies beneath: Climate change, land expropriation, and zaï agroecological innovations by smallholder farmers in Northern Ghana","Large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) are increasing in Ghana amid a weak legal and regulatory framework. This paper explores the impacts of this phenomenon on farmer innovations under recurrent environmental changes. Using a case study of zaï, an indigenous innovative farming practice, the paper makes two interrelated arguments. Firstly, it shows that the pervasive enclosures coerced by the Ghanaian state undermine how indigenous knowledge could be proactively deployed for climate risk management. Secondly, LSLAs produce a social barrier to climate change adaptation, as they lead to heightened uncertainty and apprehension among farmers, which affects decisions on climate risk management. More specifically, land expropriation is an example of how adaptation could be hindered by governance, institutions, and policy at the extra-local scale, including not only existing land use laws, but also the constitutional guarantee of private property. The evidence supporting these arguments come from survey data on 619 plots, 70 in-depth interviews, village-level transect walks, and participant observations. Overall, the paper contributes to emerging debates at the interface of land use policy, climate justice, and sustainable adaptation. Theoretically, it also contributes to understanding State-society relations, as well as the political economy of eminent domain, often justified through discourses of “public benefits.” © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Agroecology and sustainable food systems: Participatory research to improve food security among HIV-affected households in northern Malawi,"This article shares results from a long-term participatory agroecological research project in northern Malawi. Drawing upon a political ecology of health conceptual framework, the paper explores whether and how participatory agroecological farming can improve food security and nutrition among HIV-affected households. In-depth interviews were conducted with 27 farmers in HIV-affected households in the area near Ekwendeni Trading Centre in northern Malawi. The results show that participatory agroecological farming has a strong potential to meet the food, dietary, labour and income needs of HIV-affected households, whilst helping them to manage natural resources sustainably. As well, the findings reveal that place-based politics, especially gendered power imbalances, are imperative for understanding the human impacts of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Overall, the study adds valuable insights into the literature on the human-environment dimensions of health. It demonstrates that the onset of disease can radically transform the social relations governing access to and control over resources (e.g., land, labour, and capital), and that these altered social relations in turn affect sustainable disease management. The conclusion highlights how the promotion of sustainable agroecology could help to partly address the socio-ecological challenges associated with HIV/AIDS. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Climate justice and the politics of extraction in Africa: the case of Zimbabwe,"This practice note links climate justice with the politics of extraction in Africa, using the case of lithium mining in Zimbabwe. The note emanates from a critical review of how current activities in key sectors at the centre of extractive politics in Africa, particularly mining, expose political rhetoric in as far as the move to and benefits of green transition in Africa are concerned. As the global demand for minerals important in climate change mitigation like cobalt and lithium rises, it appears the extraction patterns from colonial times are continuing and local communities directly impacted by extraction of these minerals are not meaningfully benefiting. Concerns have been raised around poor safety standards, unsafe working conditions, unfair displacement measures, environmental damage, and low wages for the workers. The practice note advances recommendations for a just green transition particularly as it involves the mining sector and implications of mining activities in Africa. © 2025 The Author(s).

Climate change adaptation strategy of agricultural sector in Southeast Asia,"Tropical regions such as Southeast Asia are more vulnerable to food insecurity because climate change causes disruptions in the food supply chain. An extreme increase in the population exacerbates this condition. Southeast Asia also often experiences extreme weather, adversely affecting the farmers' livelihood. Climate change that has occurred for decades has forced smallholder farmers to adapt. This study aims to identify the impact of climate change and adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers and other Southeast Asian stakeholders. The methods used in this study are bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review (SLR). The result explains that climate change significantly impacts the decline in agricultural productivity, food nutrition, environmental quality, and resource instability. Climate change has also contributed to the increase in poverty. The adaptation strategies at the upstream level include sustainable agricultural practices, agroforestry, circular economy, crop-livestock integration, forest recovery, environmentally-friendly technology, changes in sowing and planting dates, traditional water irrigation practices, and smart farming. At the downstream level, many rural farmers migrate to cities because they cannot continue farming. The government has implemented social protection and climate risk insurance schemes for farmer households at the downstream level. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

"Species composition, damage and methods of protection from pests in the greenhouse","As vegetable crops are essential for feeding the world's population, significant effort is put into growing environmentally friendly food while also raising production, reducing prices, and improving export potential. In the world, 2.496 million hectares of land are planted with cucumbers, producing 83.8 million tonnes of vegetables yearly. At 65 million tonnes, China is in first place, followed by Iran, Russia, Turkey, and the United States. Vegetable crops are essential for feeding the world's population, which implies their significance in ensuring food security. Additionally, the text mentions that efforts are being made to cultivate ecologically sound produce, increase productivity, and enhance export potential. Results showed that the pest caused a sharp decrease in carbohydrate levels in plant stems and roots, disrupted photosynthesis and metabolism in leaves, and caused changes in leaf shape. Severe damage could result in plant death and reduced yields. The effectiveness of three chemical insecticides, namely Xen pin R, Cruiser, and Viospilan, against aphids was tested. Xen pin R and Cruiser showed high efficacy against aphids, resulting in 94.3-98.2% and 84.4-90.0% yield on the 21st and 14th day, respectively. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Habitat assessment for ecosystem services in South Africa,"Biodiversity is the foundation of life-support systems on earth and underpins the delivery of ecosystem services (ES) important for human well-being. The loss of biodiversity worldwide, however, remains one of the most daunting challenges. Among the major causes of biodiversity loss is habitat loss due to transformation of land to agricultural, mining and urban areas. We applied the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) biodiversity modelling tool to assess the condition of habitats to support the delivery of ES in a biosphere reserve (BR) in South Africa. Results indicated that 72% of the surveyed habitats were of high quality to provide the necessary services. However, some of the habitats were found to be affected by threats as follows: low (0–20%) to moderate (20–32%) habitat loss was recorded in habitats adjacent to mining and plantation areas, and high (32–56%) to severe (56–95%) habitat loss was recorded in habitats in close proximity to urban and cultivated areas. At least 56% of the vegetation types found in the study area were threatened by transformation to agriculture, mining and urban areas. We strongly recommend that existing biodiversity policies and legislation should be enforced to avoid habitat loss and degradation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"Farmland fragmentation and defragmentation nexus: Scoping the causes, impacts, and the conditions determining its management decisions","Theoretically, both land fragmentation and consolidation (defragmentation) approaches are considered as tools of land management. However, although a large literature about the relationships among land fragmentation, land consolidation, agriculture production and crops diversification concepts exists, less is known about the linkages among the conditions determining the decisions about the adoption of these tools in a given area. This poses a major dilemmatic challenge to policy makers about whether to devise policies in favour of fragmentation conservation or defragmentation. Therefore, this study identifies the conditions under which one could opt for land fragmentation or defragmentation policies by critically reviewing the documented causal-effects relationships between different fragmentation forms and defragmentation approaches. The end goal is the development of an explicit comprehensive model indicating when, where and why farmland fragmentation can be preserved or eliminated for food security purposes within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 12, 13 and 15). Following the rationalist theory, the study adopts an integrative concept-centric qualitative approach which builds on the analysis of existing literature and deductive logical reasoning to create new comprehensive scientific knowledge about a topic, as an informative guidance for future research and policies. Contrary to the majority of existing literature, this study posits that farmland fragmentation is not necessarily a problem. The scenarios and extent to which it becomes problematic or beneficial are dependent on a combination of a number of local specific external circumstances, ranging from biophysical, social, economic, political, technical to agro-ecological ones. For subsistence motives, labour, risks and conflicts management, climate change adaptation and household food security purposes, both physical in terms of internal and location, and tenure fragmentation of farmland in a given heterogeneous area under the subsistence and middle-income economies can be conserved either in combination with or without agriculture intensification programs. On the other hand, both physical and tenure fragmentation of farmland under homogenous agro-ecological conditions, and physical fragmentation under heterogeneous agro-ecological conditions and strong complex economies can be revoked for the purposes of improving farm efficiency, food quantity and supply, and food security. We therefore argue that any policy to adapt the extent of farmland fragmentation should consider both the benefits and costs of such intervention in relation to the specific local context. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The Past and Future of the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project,"Climate change is increasingly affecting the world's ocean ecosystems, necessitating urgent guidance on adaptation strategies to limit or prevent catastrophic impacts. The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) is a network and framework that provides standardised ensemble projections of the impacts of climate change and fisheries on ocean life and the benefits that it provides to people. Since its official launch in 2013 as a small, self-organized project within the larger Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, the FishMIP community has grown substantially and contributed to key international policy processes, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report, and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Global Biodiversity Assessment. While not without challenges, particularly around comparing heterogeneous ecosystem models, integrating fisheries scenarios, and standardising regional-scale ecosystem models, FishMIP outputs are now being used across a variety of applications (e.g., climate change targets, fisheries management, marine conservation, Sustainable Development Goals). Over the next decade, FishMIP will focus on improving ecosystem model ensembles to provide more robust and policy-relevant projections for different regions of the world under multiple climate and societal change scenarios, and continue to be open to a broad spectrum of marine ecosystem models and modelers. FishMIP also intends to enhance leadership diversity and capacity-building to improve representation of early- and mid-career researchers from under-represented countries and ocean regions. As we look ahead, FishMIP aims to continue enhancing our understanding of how marine life and its contributions to people may change over the coming century at both global and regional scales. © 2024.

Tapping Into the Environmental Co-benefits of Improved Tropical Forages for an Agroecological Transformation of Livestock Production Systems,"Livestock are critical for incomes, livelihoods, nutrition and ecosystems management throughout the global South. Livestock production and the consumption of livestock-based foods such as meat, cheese, and milk is, however, under global scrutiny for its contribution to global warming, deforestation, biodiversity loss, water use, pollution, and land/soil degradation. This paper argues that, although the environmental footprint of livestock production presents a real threat to planetary sustainability, also in the global south, this is highly contextual. Under certain context-specific management regimes livestock can deliver multiple benefits for people and planet. We provide evidence that a move toward sustainable intensification of livestock production is possible and could mitigate negative environmental impacts and even provide critical ecosystem services, such as improved soil health, carbon sequestration, and enhanced biodiversity on farms. The use of cultivated forages, many improved through selection or breeding and including grasses, legumes and trees, in integrated crop-tree-livestock systems is proposed as a stepping stone toward agroecological transformation. We introduce cultivated forages, explain their multi-functionality and provide an overview of where and to what extent the forages have been applied and how this has benefited people and the planet alike. We then examine their potential to contribute to the 13 principles of agroecology and find that integrating cultivated forages in mixed crop-tree-livestock systems follows a wide range of agroecological principles and increases the sustainability of livestock production across the globe. More research is, however, needed at the food system scale to fully understand the role of forages in the sociological and process aspects of agroecology. We make the case for further genetic improvement of cultivated forages and strong multi-disciplinary systems research to strengthen our understanding of the multidimensional impacts of forages and for managing agro-environmental trade-offs. We finish with a call for action, for the agroecological and livestock research and development communities to improve communication and join hands for a sustainable agri-food system transformation.

International Environmental Agreements and Environmental Health,"International agreements are an important feature of the regulatory and policy process for dealing with global environmental health issues. Although most environmental problems affect human health directly or indirectly to some extent, some are of critical importance to human health and the focus of the article is on these. Negotiating the agreements is a complex problem requiring dynamic interaction with evolving scientific knowledge and careful attention to equity issues across countries at differing levels of economic development. Scales and modes of analysis need to be consistent with preferences over risks and valuation of morbidity and mortality for current and future generations. Agreements cannot generally dictate the implementation process a given signatory state will choose, and often international organizations cannot directly monitor progress, so designing consistent incentives into an agreement is important. Many environmental and health issues are connected in complicated ways in both the physical and policy realms. Coordinating agreements can help avoid costs and delays associated with inconsistent policies. Although international environmental agreements are important determinants of global environmental health, trade agreements and other international organizations and structures are also influential. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Potential economic impacts of global wild catch fishery decline in Southeast Asia and South America,"This paper examines the economy-wide impacts of wild catch fishery decline due to climate change on major wild catch producing countries in Southeast Asia and South America, particularly focusing on food industries. A global economic model has been extended to separate the choice between wild catch and aquaculture in the production and consumption functions. The fish commodity/sector is also disaggregated in the database into wild catch and aquaculture commodities/sectors in order to make it compatible with the modified model. Results show that the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Ecuador and Peru experience considerable impacts on their economies, food industries, and households. Vietnam experiences the lowest impact on their economy because of low impact on their ocean fish resource. Results also indicate that expansions in aquaculture outputs are not adequate to compensate losses in wild catch production in all countries, and there will be a scarcity of fish in the international market that will be harmful to international trade of wild catch and aquaculture, as well as global food security. Households will also be substantially vulnerable due to high prices of fish and lower income levels resulting from contractions of production levels. © 2019",Not About Sufficiency
Contributions of information and communications technology to future health systems and universal health coverage: Application of Japan’s experiences,"Background: Demographic changes in the pattern of disease burden, escalating health expenditures and inequitable access to healthcare are global challenges. Irrespective of their level of development, all countries need to reform their health systems to prepare for the future emerging health needs, in order to meet their commitments of health systems strengthening, universal health coverage (UHC) and explicit targets in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Summary: We propose three core principles for the future health system as described herein. A health system is not simply a ‘cure delivery machine’ but part of a ‘social security system’ that engages all stakeholders through a shared vision and value of health and well-being, not merely an absence of diseases. The future health system shall provide people-centred, affordable care, tailored to the individual’s needs, accessible at any time and any place, and reflect the notion of leaving no one behind through a life course approach — underpinned by the SDGs. Information and communications technology (ICT) offers the potential to facilitate the realisation of these principles by improving the information flow between different parts of the health system through electronic means. We introduce Japan’s new data platform — Person-centred Open PLatform for wellbeing (PeOPLe) — planned to be introduced in 2020 as one example of an ICT-based intervention to realise the three proposed principles. PeOPLe integrates data collected throughout the life course to enable all people to receive affordable, personalised health and social care at any time and any place throughout their lifetime. Furthermore, we discuss the applicability of these principles and PeOPLe to the health systems context of Thailand and the Philippines, including elaborations on ICT transformation challenges. Conclusion: Current rising momentum and scale for ICTs in the UHC era offers a great opportunity to make a difference for countries. The PeOPLe concept is not only relevant to resource-rich countries; its applicability to other Asian countries could be feasible though it will need to be adapted to the various country contexts. We hope that this paper contributes to wider discussion around policy choices of ICT application for future health systems strengthening and UHC in order to achieve the SDGs. © The Author(s). 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
A comparative analysis of the performance of common cropping systems used in the production of maize and selected grain legumes in Cameroon,"Cropping systems and crop combinations are among vital practices to improve land utilisation with the limited arable land resource. Combinations of maize with legumes are common in Cameroon, but there is a knowledge gap on locality specificity of the best cropping system and maize/legume combination for sustained production. The experiment was conducted at the Faculty of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine Teaching and Research farm, University of Buea. Different cropping systems and crop combinations were planted in a Randomized Complete Block Design with 13 treatments replicated three times. Data collected for vigour and yield parameters, were analyzed for significance using a two-way ANOVA and treatment means compared using Tukey HSD at 5 % probability, while additional data, were analysed for land equivalent and benefit-cost ratio. The findings reveal no significant differences in the yield of maize under different cropping systems, except for maize-dwarf bean mix cropping system (MDBM), which recorded the lowest yield (3.9 t/ha), with maize soybean intercropping (MSBI), recording the highest yield (5.9 t/ha) for maize. Indeterminate legumes (cowpea and climbing beans) recorded significant results for yield (MCPI = 1.7 t/ha; MCBI = 1.8 t/ha) under intercropping system. Likewise, determinate legumes (dwarf beans and soybeans) also recorded significant results for yield (DB = 2.2 t/ha; SB = 3.5 t/ha) under mono cropping system. Land equivalent ratios for intercropping and mixed cropping systems were highest with MCBI = 1.93 and MCBM = 1.76 and the benefit-cost ratios for intercropping and mixed cropping were >1, with MSBI recording the highest ratio of 3.5, followed by MSBM = 3.3. Intercropping and mixed cropping systems and crop combinations were advantageous over monocropping as they gave better land equivalent and benefit-cost ratio. This study provides meaningful findings in bridging the knowledge gap on locality specificity of the best cropping systems and maize/legume combination, for sustained production, locally and nationally. The contribution to the sustainable development goals (SDG), are multidimensional: The enhancement of food security through improved crop yields (SDG2); the promotion of agricultural practices that mitigate environmental degradation (SDG13) and lastly, advocating for biodiversity conservation through the adoption of sustainable cropping systems (SDG15). © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
An enhanced framework for regional tourism sustainable adaptation to climate change,"Tourism is not only contributing to climate change but also vulnerable to risks induced by changing climate regime. Sea level rise, extreme events, loss of biodiversity, water stress among other direct and indirect impacts pose potential danger for the tourism industry. Although mitigation to reduce GHGs is equally important, adaptation is urgent. The need for urgent adaptation to climate change has triggered tourism stakeholders and the research community to develop generic adaptation framework(s) for national, regional or local tourism destinations. These frameworks are used to guide tourism policy makers in the adaptation process with an aim of reducing destination's vulnerability and to increase their resilience. Whilst some destinations are already implementing planed adaptation using these frameworks, caution has been raised that current adaptation strategies sought are far from sustainable. Assuming that the frameworks are the guiding tools for adaptation we hereby question their suitability in achieving sustainable adaptation. Sustainable adaptation in this context refers to those approaches that reduce destination's vulnerability and increase resilience without jeopardizing its economic viability, social justice and environmental integrity. This paper reviews the existing tourism specific adaptation frameworks based on the basic principles of sustainable adaptation and the wider discourse on sustainable development. Claims are laid on how the existing tourism adaptation frameworks fail to fulfil the basic principles of sustainable adaptation. Further attempts are made to propose an enhanced Regional Tourism Sustainable Adaptation Framework. The framework is a significant contribution in two ways. First it contributes to the new school of thought, on sustainable adaptation, where knowledge is lacking and secondly, it provides a practical tool for sustainable adaptation that may be used by destination managers and policy makers in the adaptation process. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Building climate-sensitive nutrition programmes,"The food system and climate are closely interconnected. Although most research has focused on the need to adopt a plant-based diet to help mitigate climate change, there is also an urgent need to examine the effects of climate change on food systems to adapt to climate change. A systems approach can help identify the pathways through which climate influences food systems, thereby ensuring that programmes combating malnutrition take climate into account. Although little is known about how climate considerations are currently incorporated into nutrition programming, climate information services have the potential to help target the delivery of interventions for at-risk populations and reduce climate-related disruption during their implementation. To ensure climate services provide timely information relevant to nutrition programmes, it is important to fill gaps in our knowledge about the influence of climate variability on food supply chains. A proposed roadmap for developing climate-sensitive nutrition programmes recommends: (i) research aimed at achieving a better understanding of the pathways through which climate influences diet and nutrition, including any time lags; (ii) the identification of entry points for climate information into the decision-making process for nutrition programme delivery; and (iii) capacity-building and training programmes to better equip public health practitioners with the knowledge, confidence and motivation to incorporate climate resilience into nutrition programmes. With sustained investment in capacity-building, data collection and analysis, climate information services can be developed to provide the data, analyses and forecasts needed to ensure nutrition programmes target their interventions where and when they are most needed. © 2022, World Health Organization.

Valuing forest ecosystem services: Case study of a forest reserve in Japan,"Forests provide several intangible benefits such as regulating local and global climate, protecting watersheds, arresting soil erosion, nutrient cycling, etc., which policymakers ignore since these values do not register in conventional markets or are difficult to measure. While in the past the use, non-use and intrinsic values were cited to justify conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) added another dimension – viz. its role in providing ecosystem services which impact on human well-being and sustainable development (MEA, 2005; Ninan, 2007, 2011). In a seminal article, Costanza et al. (1997) estimated the total annual value of the world’s ecosystem services at an average of US$33 trillion, and of global forests at US$969 per hectare. Despite Japan having the largest proportion of land area under forests among high income countries in the world (about 69 per cent as per the Global Forest Resources Assessment Report for 2010), surprisingly there are very few studies which have assessed the economic value of the ecosystem services of Japan’s forests, and these being in Japanese are not easily accessible to the international scientific community. One such study cited recently estimated the total economic value of the ecosystem services of Japan’s forests at about US$620 billion (2001 US$) per annum (MRC, 2001; White et al., 2011). This chapter, therefore, makes a case study to assess the economic value of the ecosystem services of forests in Japan. © K.N. Ninan 2014. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring temperature indices by deriving relationship between land surface temperature and urban landscape,"Global warming and climate change are two indispensable phenomena that cannot be overlooked. These can be inferred to the unrelenting rise in surface temperature globally. Unplanned and speedy urbanization is one of the foremost causes of surface temperature rise as it alters the landscape. Urbanization defines the socio-economic value of city and management but if inadvertent, it can lead to serious insinuations on environmental parameters. As a result of globalization and industrialization, a sheer increase in population was observed due to migration, improved health facilities, better job opportunities and superior living standards. It is necessary to inculcate the demand of these rising urban dwellers in the form of infrastructure, energy, clean air and water. As a result of this, landscape restructuring befalls that can be understood by conversion of green or open spaces into concrete structures. This alters the surface properties causing changes in latent and sensible heat flux leading to increased surface temperature as well as ambient air temperatures. With clustered urban spaces and decrease in vegetation cover and water that acts as sinks, the temperature of urban region shoots more than nearby rural areas leading to the development of urban heat islands. These parameters are directly and indirectly related to air pollution, increased summer days, energy requirement, heat-related diseases, emission of GHGs (greenhouse gases). The communication focuses on the recent challenges and criticism faced by developing Indian cities with very minimum landscape to house burgeoning population, immediate strategies and action-plan required to tackle increasing temperatures and mitigate negative environmental impacts and effects on human beings. The study is an attempt to establish a relationship between surface temperature and land use pattern for Kolkata Metropolitan Area. Study also deals with the estimation of various temperature indices for defining and understanding the variation in surface temperature precisely. Application of these results will help in developing necessary policy measures and sustainable actions that are required to reduce anthropogenic effects on urban and natural environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Modeling deficit irrigation water productivity as a function of crop root depth,"Water scarcity is becoming a severe problem under arid and semi-arid regions. This water scarcity is due to increase in population growth and standards of living. These factors also affected negatively the availability of agricultural land and the reduction in water resources. Add to that the misunderstanding by the end users of the concept of soil-water-plant-atmosphere relationship. Therefore, it is a must to increase the water use efficiency and water productivity in agriculture, since irrigation of crops consume more than 75% of the water resource in arid and semi-arid regions. In order to achieve the improvement of water use efficiency, and to meet the goal of high demand on food and fiber, it is important to model the relation between crop root distribution and extraction and evapotranspiration utilizing the weather data and the soil properties. The food and agriculture organization (FAO) had developed a computer model/ CropWat (FAO, 1998) to calculate crop evapotranspiration based on Penman-Monteith modified equation and crop factor. This model takes into consideration deficit irrigation in general, but did not consider the root distribution and the absorption of the water among each segment of the root depth. An experiment was carried on during the growing season of 2007 and 2008 on potato, and peppers, where the roots were partially filled to field capacity i.e. the roots depth was divided into four parts 25% each part. The water treatments were fill the first quarter from the top to field capacity, fill the top 50% of the root to field capacity, fill the top 75% to field capacity and last treatment which the control fill the whole root zone to field capacity. Results indicates and will be presented that the 50% treatment gave significant and higher total yield and marketable yield than the other treatments for bothcrops. Also water saving was significantly higher in the 50% treatment, and so the water use efficiency and the water productivity.",Not About Sufficiency

"Assessing, valuing and mapping ecosystem services at city level: The case of Uppsala (Sweden)","Urbanization is an important driver of environmental changes causing an increasing demand of ecosystem services while altering natural ecosystems. Yet, the sustainable management of urban areas can support the long-term provision of goods and services typical of healthy and resilient ecosystems and essential for human well-being. In this study, multiple ecosystem services generated by forest, agricultural (cropland and grassland), and urban areas in the municipality of Uppsala (Sweden) were first assessed in biophysical terms and then valued in money units. Afterwards, the economic value of provisioning and regulating services was spatialized using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The economic value of all investigated services amounted to 1.81 billion Swedish Kronor (SEK) or 198 million € per year, of which: 80% generated by forest areas, 19% by agricultural areas, and 1% by green urban areas. Considering the size of different land uses, the average economic value of green urban areas was the highest (20,000 SEK ha−1 or 2200 € ha−1), followed by forest areas (11,387 SEK ha−1 or 1250 € ha−1), and agricultural areas (6398 SEK ha−1 or 703 € ha−1). The integration between the assessment of the biophysical and economic value of several ecosystem services provided by different land uses as well as their spatial analysis allowed a deeper understanding on the ecological life-support system to the urban area of Uppsala. In conclusion, we maintain that the interplay between nature services and human settlements can be better explored by using an interdisciplinary approach providing ecological and economic information integrated in support of policy makers and urban planners. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Rainwater harvesting in challenging environments: Towards institutional frameworks for sustainable domestic water supply,"Rainwater harvesting (RWH) has proved to be a viable alternative water source in challenging environments where other means of water supply have no or very little potential. In the last two decades, interest in RWH has grown. Several governments of Southern countries have taken the initiative to scale up community-based RWH approaches and networks have been established between Southern and Northern civil society organizations, governments, private sector and research institutes to support and promote upscaling of RWH. This paper describes the approach taken by one of these network organizations in water-scarce, remote and marginalized areas, and discusses lessons learned, challenges and the way forward. The main challenges are: 1) the multi-layer institutional model requires substantial initial investment and effective communication between organizations, water users and governments; 2) women's involvement in community management of RWH systems is still weak; and 3) initial investment costs for rainwater harvesting tanks are relatively high, limiting replication by communities in challenging environments. © Practical Action Publishing, 2010.",Not About Sufficiency
Beyond Technical Fixes: climate solutions and the great derangement,"Climate change research is at an impasse. The transformation of economies and everyday practices is more urgent, and yet appears ever more daunting as attempts at behaviour change, regulations, and global agreements confront material and social-political infrastructures that support the status quo. Effective action requires new ways of conceptualizing society, climate and environment and yet current research struggles to break free of established categories. In response, this contribution revisits important insights from the social sciences and humanities on the co-production of political economies, cultures, societies and biophysical relations and shows the possibilities for ontological pluralism to open up for new imaginations. Its intention is to help generate a different framing of socionatural change that goes beyond the current science-policy-behavioural change pathway. It puts forward several moments of inadvertent concealment in contemporary debates that stem directly from the way issues are framed and imagined in contemporary discourses. By placing values, normative commitments, and experiential and plural ways of knowing from around the world at the centre of climate knowledge, we confront climate change with contested politics and the everyday foundations of action rather than just data. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Obstacles and opportunities for implementing a policy-mix for ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change in Brazil's Caatinga,"The Brazilian Semiarid historically suffers from droughts and environmental degradation. It is dominated by Caatinga, the world's most diverse seasonally dry forest and home to 59% of Brazilians in extreme poverty, most in rural areas under water scarcity. Land use and climate changes are expected to exacerbate socio-economic vulnerability, making it a top climate change adaptation priority. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) is a mix of policies, more cost-effective when promoting adaptation. Through a systematic review, we investigated the political context percolating EbA and climate change adaptation in the Caatinga. Unlike the political history, land use policies in Caatinga should support sustainable agriculture and ecosystem conservation to promote adaptation. We discuss obstacles and opportunities for implementing EbA in the region and present a novel EbA policy-mix framework integrated with the Coexistence with the Semi-aridity paradigm. This includes contextualized education, capacity development, social technologies, well planned and climate resilient protected areas, and land title grants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Effectively enhancing perceptions of cultural ecosystem services: A case study of a karst cultural ecosystem,"The role of cultural ecosystem services (CES) is vital to consider when developing ecological sustainable development policies that can improve the well-being of humans. Research on CES has increased in recent years; however, few studies have explored the complex mechanisms driving perceptions of CES and the factors influencing those perceptions. In areas with unique landforms and fragile ecological environments, this type of research is difficult and rare. To address this research gap, this focuses on a typical karst area Guilin Xingping in China, evaluating residents' perceptions of local CES, and applying qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to explore the driving mechanism behind those perceptions. We found that the satisfaction of material needs is a prerequisite and basis for further improving residents' spiritual perceptions and pursuits. Residents' socio-economic level, understanding of resource importance, and economic value determine whether residents can fully perceive the value of CES. Optimizing the ability of managers, improving relevant systems, and improving the experience with and understanding of ecosystems have a more than 50% probability of improving perceptions related to CES. The research shows that the combination of multiple antecedents can achieve a high level of perceptions related to CES. Managers can refer to the best path for policy regulation based on the actual situation. Finally, this study provides a new policy scheme for promoting ecological sustainable development and improving residents' well-being, and can provide insights to inform the sustainable development of other karst areas. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying the costs and benefits of forest conversion through slash-and-burn cultivation and conventional logging,"Food insecurity, deforestation, and forest degradation are significant challenges to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in sub-Saharan Africa. Slash-and-burn cultivation and conventional logging (timber and charcoal production) are two interrelated activities that lead to forest loss and undermine food security. However, the environmental and economic incentives to clear or conserve the forest have yet to be discovered. To address this gap, our study collected costs and benefits data to assess financial profitability and viability related to forest conversion to slash-and-burn cultivation options (e.g., mono-cropping of maize and intercropping between maize, cassava and pigeon peas) and forestry exploitation (logging and charcoal production) practices in smallholders in Zambézia province, central Mozambique. Conventional logging was the highest cost activity (1662 US$ ha−1) compared to charcoal production (278 US$ ha−1) and cropping systems. Estimated total costs for cropping ranged from 302 US$ ha−1 to 508 US$ ha−1. Cropping systems appear more profitable in the first year of investment (30 to 1495 US$ ha−1) than forestry activities. On the other hand, the estimated profits for logging and charcoal production are negative at 15 US$ ha−1 and 782 US$ ha−1, respectively. Regarding viability, cropping systems showed the highest indicators compared to forestry activities. Based on the financial assessment, cropping systems seem attractive land use options with the fastest and highest financial returns and the lowest production costs. As such, it is not easy to prevent them. The long-term implications of increasing deforestation to the detriment of the cropping system can translate into rapid ecosystem degradation that can worsen livelihoods. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"A cleaner production approach to urban water management: Potential for application in Harare, Zimbabwe","Water quality is an urgent problem in the Lake Chivero catchment, Zimbabwe, whilst water scarcity will be a problem soon. This study focused on assessing the potential impacts of the application of cleaner production principles in urban water supply and sanitation in the context of sustainable management of water resources. The cleaner production principles are explained together with how they can be applied to urban water management. Data from City of Harare and previous studies were collected and analysed. The study focused mainly on water, nitrogen and phosphorus. About 304,000 m3/d of wastewater, containing 30,000 kg/d TN and 3600 kg/d TP are currently produced and treated at five sewage treatment works in Harare. Water conservation, treatment and reuse strategies were developed for different land uses starting from water-saving devices, regulation, leak detection and repair, to wastewater treatment and reuse. This study showed that the application of the cleaner production principles would reduce total wastewater production from 487,000 m3/d to 379,000 m3/d (a 27% reduction) based on year 2015 projections. A very large investment in treatment infrastructure can be postponed for about 10 years. In terms of amounts treated and discharged at central level this translates to reductions of 47% on flows, 34% on TN, and 44% on TP. River discharges can be eliminated. It was concluded that a cleaner production approach could substantially reduce current water pollution and long-term scarcity problems in Harare. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Agrifood systems and the microbial safety of fresh produce: Trade-offs in the wake of increased sustainability,"Fresh produce has been a growing cause of food borne outbreaks world-wide prompting the need for safer production practices. Yet fresh produce agrifood systems are diverse and under constraints for more sustainability. We analyze how measures taken to guarantee safety interact with other objectives for sustainability, in light of the diversity of fresh produce agrifood systems. The review is based on the publications at the interface between fresh produce safety and sustainability, with sustainability defined by low environmental impacts, food and nutrition security and healthy life. The paths for more sustainable fresh produce are diverse. They include an increased use of ecosystem services to e.g. favor predators of pests, or to reduce impact of floods, to reduce soil erosion, or to purify run-off waters. In contrast, they also include production systems isolated from the environment. From a socio-economical view, sustainability may imply maintaining small tenures with a higher risk of pathogen contamination. We analyzed the consequences for produce safety by focusing on risks of contamination by water, soil, environment and live stocks. Climate change may increase the constraints and recent knowledge on interactions between produce and human pathogens may bring new solutions. Existing technologies may suffice to resolve some conflicts between ensuring safety of fresh produce and moving towards more sustainability. However, socio-economic constraints of some agri-food systems may prevent their implementation. In addition, current strategies to preserve produce safety are not adapted to systems relying on ecological principles and knowledge is lacking to develop the new risk management approaches that would be needed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",Not About Sufficiency
Factors Affecting CO2 Emissions from Direct Energy Household Consumption in Vietnam,"The energy sector is pivotal in Vietnam’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This study employs a combination of Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) and decoupling approaches based on data from Vietnam’s energy statistics and the Vietnam Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) for 2016, 2018, and 2020. The primary aim is to elucidate the effects of direct energy consumption by household groups on CO2 emissions, examine factors affecting emissions, and clarify the relationship between CO2 emissions from household energy consumption and economic growth in Vietnam. Research results underscore that household groups make considerable use of electricity and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), simultaneously reducing the proportion of firewood, rice husk, sawdust, agricultural by-products and other fuels. The decrease in energy intensity emerges as the primary factor in lowering household emissions, while population growth and economic efficiency exert the opposite effect. Additionally, the research reveals disparities in emissions between urban and rural areas, similarly among household groups within the given location. Despite maintaining a robust decoupling status between emissions from household consumption and economic growth, unsustainable risks persist, particularly with the increase in electricity demand. The study also highlights the uneven impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on CO2 emissions across household groups. Drawing upon these findings, several recommendations are proposed to control CO2 emissions from direct energy household consumption to facilitate the most effective household decarbonisation process while ensuring sustainable economic growth in Vietnam.

Exploring the Role of Social Capital in Urban Resilience for Sustainable Development: The Case of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam,"The escalation of climate change has challenged urban sustainable development, especially in the top globally vulnerable countries. This paper investigates the role of social capital in shaping the resilience of residents in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's first mega urban, based on survey data from 300 households, using a stratified sampling strategy to reflect the urban and suburban population structure of the city-dwellers with the application of PLS-SEM. The study highlights the significant role of bridging social capital, drawing on established research and theories, which emphasizes the importance of diverse social networks in enhancing problem-solving, optimism, material resources, and social resources. Additionally, the study uncovers the impact of bonding social capital, particularly in terms of enhancing material and social resources, underscoring the cultural inclination towards close-knit networks within Vietnamese society. Structural barriers associated with vertical networks are identified, implying the need to promote the role of linking social capital in enhancing resilience. The study confirms the cruciality of addressing socio-economic factors and promoting access to formal support systems for bolstering overall resilience among urban residents in Ho Chi Minh City and beyond. The results enrich the current literature when operationalizing and exploring the nexus of social capital and resilience multi-dimensionally in a mega urban setting of an emerging country for new pathways to achieve sustainability. © 2024 The authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"The measurement of green economic quality in the BRICS countries: Should they prioritize financing for environmental protection, economic growth, or social goals?","The study presents a Green Economy Index that evaluates the quality of green economies in the BRICS countries based on three pillars: environment, economic performance, and quality of green living. Research findings suggest that the BRICS nations are gradually shifting their focus from mere economic growth to encompassing environmental, social welfare, and equality concerns. Russia showcased the best balance among these three pillars from 2011 to 2020, while India and China made notable strides. Nevertheless, Brazil and South Africa face obstacles in improving their economies and increasing social welfare. The indicators highlight specific challenges each country must address, including high unemployment in Brazil and South Africa, low energy intensity in Russia and China, and air pollution and low Human Development Index in India, alongside shared issues like low government transparency. Based on the research significant findings, the study attempts to address whether the BRICS nations should prioritize financing environmental protection, economic growth, or social goals to maintain a balance among all the three pillars and achieve their green economy objectives. © 2023 Journal of Degraded and Mining Lands Management",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable development in Vietnam: An examination of consumers' perceptions of green products,"Climate change has led to the rise of a sustainable development area characterized by the consumers' consideration of social and environmental issues. The existing literature on responsible consumption has essentially explored the context of western countries; however, little information is given around the consumer behavior towards green products in developing countries. This study enriches this literature by exploring the context of Vietnam that was heavily affected by climate changes. More precisely, the authors aim to explore the content of green products from the consumers' point of view, as well as their motivations and barriers to consume eco-friendly products. A qualitative study conducted with 29 Vietnamese respondents showed that consumers associate green products to five dimensions: environment, health, quality, price, and animal welfare. They express essentially egoistic motivations related to health and product's quality. In addition, the main barriers to purchase green products identified in the study correspond to the lack of information and confidence towards green claims, sellers, and certifications. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment",Not About Sufficiency
Economic and environmental impacts of greenhouse gas mitigation: An integrated assessment,"Despite an increasing likelihood of considerable global warming over the coming century, there is limited greenhouse mitigation action undertaken by the international community (Carraro and Massetti 2011). It is in individual and collective socio-economic and environmental interest to embark on strong mitigation action globally. The present study analyses alternative global carbon pathways to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions in the form of an illustrative and exploratory exercise. The potential economic and environmental implications of the alternative global carbon pathways are then assessed. The alternative carbon pathways analysed in this study include a high, medium and low carbon pathways that represent small, modest and large improvements in technological advancements in low emission intensive stationary and transport energy generation and energy efficiency respectively. These alternative carbon pathways are then compared to a reference case that corresponds to the baseline scenario used in the 2008 Garnaut Climate Change Review (Garnaut 2008). We use CSIRO's current version of the Global Integrated Assessment Model (GIAM-XP) (Gunasekera et al., 2008, Harman et al., 2008, Garnaut, 2008 and Scealy et al., 2011) to undertake the impacts of the alternative carbon pathway scenarios. Our analysis indicates that concerted efforts towards improvements in technological advancements in low emission intensive stationary and transport energy generation and energy efficiency could help reduce the atmospheric CO 2 concentration levels, radiative forcing and global temperature over time in a progressive manner across the scenarios analysed in this paper. Failing to do so is likely to have significant adverse impacts associated with increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration levels, radiative forcing and global temperature over the coming decades. For example, failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions substantially over the coming decades will have significant consequences in terms of increases in temperature across many parts of the world relative to what would otherwise be. Key parts of the human-earth system including water, coastal communities, natural ecosystems, and agriculture are likely to be highly vulnerable to the projected climate change illustrated in our analysis unless significant mitigation measures are undertaken in the foreseeable future to set the global economy on a low to medium carbon pathway. This would require a portfolio of mitigation measures including significant improvements in technological advancements in low emission intensive stationary and transport energy generation and energy efficiency, at national, regional and global levels. It is important to recognize that global economic output continues to increase over time, albeit at a slower rate of growth under the alternative carbon pathway scenarios compared with the reference case. However, in the long term, productivity changes and the structural adjustments underpinning the global economic activity tend to have a more favorable impact overall, particularly, in the presence of significant improvements in technological advancements in low emission intensive stationary and transport energy generation and energy efficiency. We argue in the paper that there is an increasing need for additional research into improving our understanding of inter-fuel substitution possibilities and of the less emission/energy intensive technologies available for particular industries.",Not About Sufficiency

Projecting and valuing domestic water use at regional scale: A generic method applied to the Mediterranean at the 2060 horizon,"The present work focuses on the demand side of future water scarcity assessment, and more precisely on domestic water demand. It proposes a quantitative projection of domestic water demand, combined with an original estimation of the economic benefit of water at large scale. The general method consists of building economic demand functions taking into account the impact of the level of equipment, proxied by economic development. The cost and the price of water are assumed to grow with economic development.The methodology was applied to the Mediterranean region, at the 2060 horizon. Our results show the evolution of water demand and value, measured by surplus, over time. As long as GDP per capita and water price remain low, demand per capita increases along with economic development, and surplus per capita increases with demand. As demand approaches saturation, the combined negative effects of water cost and price increase on surplus grow stronger, and surplus per capita begins to decrease.The developed methodology is meant to be used for large-scale hydroeconomic modelling, in particular for regions with heterogeneous levels of development and low data-availability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Biodiversity,"Biodiversity is a recently invented term that refers to diversity within the biosphere, including genetic, species, and habitat diversity. The concept emerged in the 1980s with the rise of biotechnology – and the consequent commodification of biological resources – and scientists’ growing awareness of an increasing species extinction rate. Increases in the numbers of extinct species and species threatened with extinction present a global biodiversity crisis, which some scientists believe constitutes the Earth’s sixth episode of mass extinction, and the first caused by human activities. Causal explanations vary, but often include disparities of wealth and poverty, insecure property rights, overpopulation, habitat loss, and climate change.

Biodiversity,"Biodiversity is a recently invented term that refers to diversity within the biosphere, including genetic, species, and habitat diversity. The concept emerged in the 1980s with the rise of biotechnology - and the consequent commodification of biological resources - and scientists' growing awareness of an increasing species extinction rate. Increases in the numbers of extinct species and species threatened with extinction present a global biodiversity crisis, which some scientists believe constitutes the Earth's sixth episode of mass extinction, and the first caused by human activities. Causal explanations vary, but often include disparities of wealth and poverty, insecure property rights, overpopulation, habitat loss, and climate change.

"Rural sustainability methods, drivers, and outcomes: A systematic review","In the past three decades, sustainability science has taken on new importance as interest groups investigate better ways to tackle global challenges—environmental degradation, climate change, and human well-being—that pose risks to communities, particularly in rural areas. Designs for sustainability require empirical evidence of what works and under what human and environmental conditions. Despite the amount of research that exists, the broad variety of research approaches and contexts makes generalizing knowledge about sustainability in rural areas challenging. This work addresses calls to consolidate the field's knowledge about rural sustainability by examining how rural sustainability has been evaluated, identifying drivers of rural sustainability and associated outcome indicators used to operationalize rural sustainability, and determining common trends in how drivers and outcomes are related. We synthesize this diverse literature to identify common themes in evaluation of rural sustainability across disciplines, global regions, and methodological approaches. Our findings indicate many methods have been used to evaluate rural sustainability, that factors derived from the Triple Bottom Line (social, economic, and environmental) are frequently used to operationalize rural sustainability, and that both direct human interventions and underlying socioeconomic drivers of sustainability are routinely examined in the literature. Overall, we find the majority of studies report positive impacts to rural sustainability, suggesting there are many avenues for creating positive change in sustainability in rural areas. However, we also find greater attention to study conceptualization, design and reporting is needed to provide greater confidence in results that inform policy and decision-making. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
The poverty of money: Marxian insights for ecological economists,"Karl Marx's philosophical, political and sociological analysis of the workings of capitalism provides insights regarding the character of monetary value (price) and the role of the market that are relevant to ecological economists. Ecological economists are divided over the utility of pricing components of ecological systems and the potential role of the market in achieving ecologically sustainable societies. In the Marxian-influenced socialist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries, similar issues were raised by those preoccupied with organising state policy and manipulating the market to achieve social justice. For example, at particular points in the Russian and Cuban revolutionary processes, the potential and limitations of monetary pricing and market exchange were debated in a heated and detailed way. In as much as ecological economists hold certain interests in common, it is worth reflecting on Marx's view of the human role within nature and analysing the discussions and experiences of Marxian experimenters in social transformation that relate specifically to exchange. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Conclusion,"With the rapid urbanisation characterising Global South cities, cities are confronted with a myriad of socio-economic and environmental challenges that are increasing in intensity and frequency. There are mounting protests by communities over the lack of service delivery, cases of misgovernance and corruption in public and private institutions, climate change-induced disasters and disease epidemics. While some cities are still grappling with the legacies of the inequalities of the colonial/apartheid government systems, these serious challenges exacerbate the already grim living conditions of the residents, especially those residing in poor neighbourhoods. In this context, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is a growing challenge in most Global South cities. Here many individuals and communities continue to be ‘left behind’ by the inability of their governments to make substantial progress in meeting the SDGs. Understanding the progress made towards the respective SDGs is critical, hence this chapter summarises the key findings and emerging issues using the case of Mangaung Metro Municipality (MMM). Our focus is on the nexus between urban health and the SDGs. This relationship is multifaceted, as the SDGs are dynamic and cross-cutting; consequently, difficult to monitor or generalise the progress on the respective indicators and targets. Despite the complex relationship between SDGs and urban health, progress is being made in some areas, while some areas still fall behind. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Scoping the Need of Mainstreaming Indigenous Knowledge for Sustainable Use of Bioresources in the Indian Himalayan Region,"Globally, Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKSs), which have evolved through rigorously tested methods and practices, are a testimony of human intelligence and endurance. The diversity of goods such as food, beverages, herbs, etc., and its associated systems, which form an integral part of modern cuisine and healthcare systems, are deeply rooted in IKS and immensely contributing to overall well-being of mankind. The present study is an attempt to document and understand the contribution of indigenous and local knowledge to biodiversity conservation and management. Appreciation to the value of traditional and indigenous knowledge is globally recognized for their principles of coexistence and sustainable use practices. Past studies indicate a strong relationship between indigenous knowledge and sustainable development goals. This knowledge is valuable not only to dependent communities, but also to the modern world for ensuring food security and human well-being. The documentation of such valuable knowledge is therefore fundamentally essential for mainstreaming and strengthening the discourses on sustainable ecosystem management, and to address the preponderance of poverty among indigenous communities. Amid the changing scenario of consumption and the trend of revisiting nature-based solutions, the IKS hold a tremendous scope of engaging the community people in sustainable harvest and utilization of natural resources. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Vulnerability to Food Insecurity in a Telecoupled World: Insights From Vanuatu,"Food insecurity is a pressing problem in many regions across the world. Drivers of food insecurity are becoming increasingly embedded in sociocultural and economic processes that transcendent multiple spatial and temporal scales. This is due to the increasingly globalized interconnections of places and people. Understanding this complexity is essential to devise locally relevant and effective adaptation strategies to tackle existing vulnerabilities causing food insecurity. This article analytically addresses the complexity in cross-scale dynamics by combining a case study from northern Vanuatu with a conceptual analysis of the broader socioeconomic dynamics within the telecoupling framework. Our aim is to identify drivers of vulnerability that span multiple temporal and spatial scales and contribute to food insecurity in a given location while exploring the relevance and applicability of the framework for the holistic assessment of vulnerability to food insecurity. The transdisciplinary approach used in this work involved local community members and local agriculture extension officers at all stages of the study process. For this, we used complementary research methods, such as workshops, participant observations, and in-depth interviews. The results showed that potential vulnerability to food insecurity in northern Vanuatu is likely to be related to individual choices aimed at maximizing income, enabled by economic development and driven by socio-cultural changes. These choices and their consequences are perceived in many cases to be responsible for lower subsistence food production and the overuse of natural food resources. However, economic changes in particular can also enable additional livelihoods that complement existing (subsistence-based) strategies, leading to a reduction in one-sided dependencies and thus to an overall increase in the resilience of local livelihoods. We find the telecoupling approach to be a useful tool to holistically capture a local vulnerability context. However, we also encountered challenges in describing telecouplings that operate over longer time scales. Copyright © 2022 Nef, Kotra, Stauffacher, Six and Kruetli.",Not About Sufficiency
Mosquito Vectors (Diptera: Culicidae) and Mosquito-Borne Diseases in North Africa,"Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are of significant public health importance because of their ability to transmit major diseases to humans and animals, and are considered as the world’s most deadly arthropods. In recent decades, climate change and globalization have promoted mosquito-borne diseases’ (MBDs) geographic expansion to new areas, such as North African countries, where some of these MBDs were unusual or even unknown. In this review, we summarize the latest data on mosquito vector species distribution and MBDs affecting both human and animals in North Africa, in order to better understand the risks associated with the introduction of new invasive mosquito species such as Aedes albopictus. Currently, 26 mosquito species confirmed as pathogen vectors occur in North Africa, including Aedes (five species), Culex (eight species), Culiseta (one species) and Anopheles (12 species). These 26 species are involved in the circulation of seven MBDs in North Africa, including two parasitic infections (malaria and filariasis) and five viral infections (WNV, RVF, DENV, SINV and USUV). No bacterial diseases have been reported so far in this area. This review may guide research studies to fill the data gaps, as well as helping with developing effective vector surveillance and controlling strategies by concerned institutions in different involved countries, leading to cooperative and coordinate vector control measures. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The experiences and challenges of community health volunteers as agents for behaviour change programming in Africa: a scoping review,"Community health volunteers are considered a vital part of the community health structure in Africa. Despite this vital role in African health systems, very little is known about the community health volunteers’ day-to-day lived experiences providing services in communities and supporting other health workers. This scoping review aims to advance understanding of the day-to-day experiences of community health volunteers in Africa. In doing so, this review draws attention to these under-considered actors in African health systems and identifies critical factors and conditions that represent challenges to community health volunteers’ work in this context. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a synthesis of key challenges and considerations that can inform efforts to reduce attrition and improve the sustainability of community health volunteers in Africa. This scoping review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews checklist to achieve the objectives. A comprehensive search of six databases returned 2140 sources. After screening, 31 peer-reviewed studies were selected for final review. Analytical themes were generated based on the reviewers’ extraction of article data into descriptive themes using an inductive approach. In reviewing community health volunteers’ accounts of providing health services, five key challenges become apparent. These are: (1) challenges balancing work responsibilities with family obligations; (2) resource limitations; (3) exposure to stigma and harassment; (4) gendered benefits and risks; and (5) health-system level challenges. This scoping review highlights the extent of challenges community health volunteers must navigate to provide services in communities. Sustained commitment at the national and international level to understand the lived experiences of community health volunteers and mitigate common stressors these health actors face could improve their performance and inform future programs. © 2022 The Author(s).

Exploring the Potential of Silicon and Salicylic Acid in the Alleviation of Water Deficit Stress in Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa),"Global warming and less uncertain rainfall have resulted in climate change and water deficit stress conditions which had a deleterious impact on the agroecosystem. Silicon (Si) exists as a beneficial component in soil and has a significant role in overcoming water scarcity problems. Si can maintain crop yield and growth even in stress conditions like salinity and water deficit stress. Salicylic acid supports the crop to withstand the harmful effects of salinity and drought stress. This growth regulator together with silicon works to alleviate the water deficit stress condition. A foliar spray of SA is beneficial for plants. A pot experiment was conducted in the greenhouse of the Institute of Soil and Environmental Sciences to evaluate the effect of Si (Control, 100 and 200 mg kg-1) and SA (Control and 1 mM) on quinoa under water deficit conditions. Treatments included: T1 = Control, T2 = Si at 100 mg kg-1, T3 = Si at 200 mg kg-1, T4 = 1 mM SA foliar, T5 = Si at 100 mg kg-1 + 1 mM SA foliar, T6 = Si at 200 mg kg-1 + 1 mM SA foliar, T7 = Water deficit, T8 = Water deficit + Si at 100 mg kg-1, T9 = Water deficit + Si at 200 mg kg-1, T10 = Water deficit + 1 mM SA foliar, T11 = Water deficit + Si at 100 mg kg-1 + 1 mM SA foliar, T12 = Water deficit + Si at 200 mg kg-1 + 1 mM SA foliar. Two water levels, control (100% FC) and deficit water stress (60% FC) were used. In the first four weeks after germination, all pots were equally irrigated and after this, water deficit stress started. A completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used to establish the experiment with three replications under a factorial arrangement. The crop was harvested at the maturity stage. It was found that water shortage followed a substantial decline in the growth and yield of quinoa. However, Si and SA improved the fresh and dry weight of the shoot, plant height, SPAD value, RWC, MSI, and productivity of quinoa under normal and water stress conditions. Therefore, it is concluded that SA and Si applications proved effective in improving crop growth in deficit water conditions by increasing the deficit water stress tolerance of quinoa plants. © 2025, HARD Publishing Company.

GREEN CITY – FUTURE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND SMART GROWTH,"The concept of the green city originally came from Europe and the North American countries, where it is very different from the concept in Asian countries because of climate, the people’s backgrounds, and the culture, goals, and history of city development. A green city is a city that demonstrates high environmental performance compared to established criteria in terms of 1) the quality of environmental assets (air, water, land / soil and biodiversity), 2) the efficient use of resources (water, energy, land and materials) and 3) mitigating risks and adapting to the risks of climate change, while maximizing economic and social co-benefits, taking into account the context of the city (population, socio-economic structure and geographic and climatic characteristics). City greening is one of the ways to pursue a green city. It is aimed at replacing the loss of green spaces that have disappeared in ongoing urban land conversion for housing and transportation. As stated in the definition of the Green City approach, measures to improve the environmental performance of a city should also seek to maximize economic and social benefits. These links between economic, social and environmental goals will provide additional motivation for city leaders to take green city action. © 2022 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

"Energy consumption, FDI, and urbanization linkage in coastal Mediterranean countries: re-assessing the pollution haven hypothesis","Foreign direct investment (FDI) and the consumption of non-renewable energy have been on the increase in the coastal Mediterranean countries (CMCs) over the last few decades. Both trigger growth, but the environmental impact could be far-reaching as environmental distortions are mainly human-induced. This study examines the environmental issues facing CMCs. Specifically, we investigate whether the pollution haven hypothesis holds for CMCs. We employ a quantile panel data analysis for CMCs to account for heterogeneity and distributional effects of socioeconomic factors. The result reveals that the influence of FDI on environmental degradation is a function of the indicators utilized and also depends on the initial levels of environmental degradation. The results suggest that the pollution haven hypothesis does not hold for CMCs. However, we also find that energy consumption significantly increases environmental degradation for all indicators and across the observed quantiles. The effects of economic growth and urbanization on the environment were mixed for the different indicators and across quantiles. We recommend that it is pertinent for CMCs to limit their “dirty” energy sources and substitute them with renewables to promote environmental sustainability. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Challenges of sustainable environmental health in developing countries,"One of the grea test failures of the last fifty years has been the failure to lay the foundation stones of public health in the developing world - hygiene, sanitation and water supply. It is a failure that today deprives hundreds of millions not only of health but of productivity. It is a failure that undermines the normal mental and physical growth of rising generations.lt is a failure that pollutes fresh water resources with faecal matter on a massive scale. It is a failure that condemns more than a billion people to live with a daily environmental crisis of squalor, smells, and diseases. And it is a failure that holds back the development of people and of nations. Despite significant progress made in the economic and industrial development, the demographic and environmental health scenario continues to be a cause of serious concern in the developing countries particularly in those of Sub-saharan Africa and South East Asia. The traditional problems of water and air-borne infections combine with malnutrition and poor environmental sanitation to form a vicious cycle which is increasing the burden of diseases beyond the capacity of the existing health infrastructure and jeopardizing the productivity of society. Today, while the urban population of these countries faces the development and environmental degradation, concurrently the rural population continues to suffer lack of sanitation and safe drinking water, malnutrition and ecological insecurity.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of the conservation status of natural and semi-natural patches associated with urban areas through habitat suitability indices,"Urban environments rely on the surrounding natural ecosystems remnants as providers of ecosystem functions, therefore these areas not only support a unique biodiversity but also have a social value for maintaining public health andwellbeing. For this reason, urbanization is considered to be one the biggest threats to ecosystems, leading to native biodiversity simplification and, thus, to a detriment of the provided ecosystemservices.Moreover, this change in land use results in high levels of landscape fragmentation and modification in areas surrounding the habitat remnantswhich, in consequence, become inadequate formany native species. In this context, it is important that urban planners have the information to assess the possible consequences of future changes in land use in order to increase the landscape chances of supporting both, native biodiversity and the needs of a growing human population. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the ecological integrity of natural and semi-natural vegetation patches immersed in an urban area in order to generate a conceptual framework for landscape assessment that allows urban planners to envision the best choice for city development at a given place. To do so, we developed a quantitative integral environmental evaluation index that includes ecological characterization, geological characterization, and environmental characterization (presence of anthropic disturbance) of the assessed area. We conclude that the index we have generated in this work is suitable to be used as a management tool to allow an unbiased valuation and to identify managing situations that require a short term response. © 2015, University of Tehran.

Integration of Watershed eco-physical health through Algorithmic game theory and supervised machine learning,"The eco-physical health assessment of watersheds is crucial for sustainable water resource management and ecosystem services. This study quantifies the eco-physical health of the Talar watershed in Iran using the geometric mean method (GMM), game-theoretic algorithm (GTA), and machine learning algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Simple Linear Regression (SLR), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for distributed and semi-distributed monitoring. The results show that the RF algorithm performed better than other models, as indicated by MAE, MSE, RMSE, and AUC statistics with values of 0.032, 0.003, 0.058, and 0.940, respectively. The watershed health index prioritization with different approaches showed that the pattern of watershed health changes positively from upstream to downstream. Based on the watershed health prioritization using GMM, it can be said that sub-watersheds Int6 and Int5 are the healthiest sub-watersheds in the studied watershed, with values of 0.93 and 0.90, respectively. Based on the watershed prioritization using the GTA approach, it can also be said that sub-watersheds Int6, Int5, and Int01 are the healthiest ones. In the case of the RF algorithm, the average values of the pixels in each sub-watershed showed that sub-watersheds Int6 and Int01 were recognized as the healthiest sub-watersheds with values of 0.91 and 0.88, respectively. Int6 consistently emerged as the healthiest sub-watershed across all methods, attributed to high TWI and NDVI values and low slope, DEM, erosion, and CN values. In general, it can be said that the watershed health index in the studied catchment fully followed the factors affecting the catchment's health and that the spatial patterns of change of this index were consistent with the physiographic and hydroclimatic conditions in all three semi-distributed and distributed approaches. The study's implications underline the importance of multi-criteria and multi-algorithm approaches in accurately assessing and managing watershed health for sustainable development. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Modelling climate change impacts and adaptation strategies for sunflower in Pakistan,"Climate change, food security, water scarcity and environmental sustainability have all become major global challenges. As a consequence, improving resource use efficiency is an important aspect of increasing crop productivity. Crop models are increasingly being used as tools for supporting strategic and tactical decision making under varying agro-climatic and socioeconomic conditions. These tools can also support climate change assessment and the evaluation of adaptation strategies to limit the adverse impacts of climate change. In this paper, the authors report on a case study conducted to assess the potential impact of climate change on grain yield in sunflower under arid, semi-arid and subhumid conditions in the Punjab region of Pakistan. Experimental data obtained between 2008 and 2009 were used for model evaluation. The study focused on the impacts of incremental temperature change on sunflower production. The modelling suggests that grain yield could reduce by up to 15% by the 2020s with an average increase in temperature of +1°C, and by up to 25% if temperatures increased by up to 2°C for the 2050s. Adaptation strategies showed that, if the crop were sown between 14 days (for 2020) and 21 days (for 2050) earlier than the current date (last week in February), yield losses could potentially be reduced.",Not About Sufficiency
DynSus: Dynamic sustainability assessment in groundwater remediation practice,"Decision-making processes for clean-up of contaminated sites are often highly complex and inherently uncertain. It depends not only on hydrological and biogeochemical site variability, but also on the associated health, environmental, economic, and social impacts of taking, or not taking, action. These variabilities suggest that a dynamic framework is required for promoting sustainable remediation. For this, the decision support system DynSus is presented here for integrating a predeveloped contaminant fate and transport model with a sustainability assessment tool. Implemented within a system dynamics framework, the new tool uses model simulations to provide remediation scenario analysis and handling of uncertainty in various data. DynSus was applied to a site in south Sweden, contaminated with pentachlorophenol (PCP). Simulation scenarios were developed to enable a comparison between alternative remediation strategies and combinations of these. Such comparisons are provided for selected sustainability indicators and remediation performance (in terms of concentration at the recipient). This leads to identifying the most critical variables to ensure that sustainable solutions are chosen. Simulation results indicated that although passive practices, e.g., monitored natural attenuation, were more sustainable at first (5–7 years after beginning remediation measures), they failed to compete with more active practices, e.g., bioremediation, over the entire life cycle of the project (from the beginning of remedial action to achieving the target concentration at the recipient). In addition, statistical tools (clustering and genetic algorithms) were used to further assess the available hydrogeochemical data. Taken together, the results reaffirmed the suitability of the simple analytical framework that was implemented in the contaminant transport model. DynSus outcomes could therefore enable site managers to evaluate different scenarios more quickly and effectively for life cycle sustainability in such a complex and multidimensional problem. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Determinants of households residential mobility decision in Kumasi Ghana,"Household relocation choices are critical in shaping urban socio-economic landscapes, especially within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study investigates the complex factors influencing household relocation decisions in Kumasi, Ghana, an urban center undergoing rapid growth. The aim is to understand how socio-economic conditions, environmental challenges, and urban policy dynamics interact to shape relocation intentions. Using a qualitative approach, this research use qualitative interviews and natural language processing (NLP) technique to capture the diverse push and pull factors motivating relocation. Findings indicate that push factors, such as inadequate housing, urban congestion, and environmental degradation, diminish quality of life and drive relocation. Conversely, pull factors, including employment opportunities, access to education and healthcare, and enhanced urban amenities, attract households to particular areas within Kumasi. This study situates these relocation dynamics within the SDG framework, highlighting the need for sustainable urban development strategies that address residents' aspirations and challenges. The results emphasize that aligning urban planning with principles of inclusivity, equity, and environmental sustainability can enhance urban resilience and community well-being. The study’s insights are valuable for policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders seeking to foster urban environments conducive to sustainable development, equitable growth, and social inclusion, ultimately advancing progress toward achieving the SDGs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Pathways to human well-being in the context of land acquisitions in Lao PDR,"Land acquisitions are transforming land-use systems globally, and their characteristics and impacts on human well-being have been extensively analysed through local case studies and regional or global inventories. However, national-level analysis that is crucial for national policy on sustainable agricultural investments and land use is still lacking. This paper conducts an archetype analysis of a unique dataset on land concessions in Lao PDR to provide a national-scale assessment of the impacts of land acquisitions on human well-being in 294 affected villages. The results show that land acquisitions influence human well-being through 18 distinct pathways. These pathways describe how some land acquisitions enhance or maintain well-being, while others elicit adverse impacts or trade-offs between well-being dimensions, particularly food security, income, and livelihood resilience. They further reveal five archetypical processes that mediate the effects of land acquisitions on well-being through: (i) shifting access to land and natural resources; (ii) commercialization of agriculture; (iii) availability of development opportunities; (iv) environmental impacts; and (v) employment opportunities within and outside land acquisitions. These processes affect well-being by shaping livelihood portfolios and dependence on natural resources. The majority of land acquisitions trigger trade-offs or adverse impacts on well-being. The small number of villages where well-being increased despite the presence of land acquisitions were mainly shaped by narrow and rigid preconditions. The archetypical processes and the explanatory factors suggest that it is imperative to protect smallholders’ land-use rights and to avoid large-scale deals, as their adverse impacts outweigh opportunities and are more severe than the impacts of small-scale acquisitions. Employment opportunities may provide additional cash income but should not be exclusively relied upon. © 2021 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Carrying capacity of an uninhabited island off the southwestern coast of Korea,"An emergy evaluation was carried out to assess the carrying capacity of a small, uninhabited island (Woosedo) off the southwestern coast of Korea. The sea area within 1. km from the high tide level of the island was included in the evaluation. The total environmental emergy input to Woosedo was 1.66E19. sej/yr, with the most emergy contribution from the tidal energy. The land and marine ecosystems of Woosedo contributed 4.97. million. Em$ (7600. Em$/ha/yr) to the Korean economy annually. If Woosedo was developed to the national average at the emergy investment ratio of 2.86, its carrying capacity was estimated at 1034 people at the current living standard of Korea. With this population, the island system would not be sustainable with a very low emergy sustainability index of 0.36. At the same living standard used in the developed scenario, the carrying capacity of the island would be 370 people for a sustainable development scenario and 270 people if the renewable emergy were the only source to support the population. The emergy contribution of the marine ecosystem of the island was the major source of support in determining the level of carrying capacity of the island. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Effect of deficit irrigation on yield quantity and quality, water productivity and economic returns of four cultivars of hops in the Yakima Valley, Washington State","Hop production, like all other water uses in the area, is facing water availability concerns. Deficit irrigation may address water scarcity issues in hop production. This study quantifies the effect of deficit irrigation on hop yield, quality, water productivity and grower profitability. Mt. Hood, Columbus, Chinook and Willamette cultivars were grown under three irrigation levels; 60, 80 and 100% of the crop's irrigation requirement, using a sub-surface drip irrigation system. Results show that hop plants generally respond to water stress with yield reductions; compared to the 100% irrigation level, the 60% irrigation level caused reductions in total 2-year dry hop cone yield of 30%, 33%, 25%, and 19% for Mt. Hood, Willamette, Columbus and Chinook cultivars respectively, whereas, the 80% irrigation level caused total 2-year yield reductions of 14%, 10%, and 3% for Mt. Hood, Willamette and Chinook cultivars respectively. For Columbus, the 80% irrigation level gave 2% more dry hop cone 2-year total yield than the fully irrigated treatment. Hop cone quality was however not affected; the concentrations of alpha and beta acids were generally similar across all irrigation levels for cultivars for each year of study. The cost of water in Washington State does not vary with changes in water use; only water pumping costs vary with water use. Pumping costs are only 1.5% of the total cost of producing hops in an established yard. As such, savings in pumping costs due to using less water were minimal when compared to the resulting loss in revenue due to yield reductions. Deficit irrigating hops grown under sub-surface drip irrigation system in the Yakima Valley is therefore not economically viable. However, under conditions of water scarcity, high water prices or when there are more profitable alternative uses for the water, deficit irrigation may then be considered. Deficit irrigation though has potential to improve water productivity as observed from the 2012 results. Under the 60% irrigation level, water productivities were 0.42, 0.55, 1.02, and 0.44 kg/m3 for Mt. Hood, Willamette, Columbus, and Chinook respectively. Under the 80% irrigation level, water productivities for Mt. Hood, Willamette, Columbus, and Chinook were 0.34, 0.41, 0.95, and 0.45 kg/m3 respectively. For full irrigation, water productivities were 0.33, 0.31, 0.84, and 0.37 kg/m3 for Mt. Hood, Willamette, Columbus, and Chinook respectively. This study provides production functions for the hop cultivars for forecasting yield quantities under various irrigation amounts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Trophic Transfer and Accumulation of Microplastics in Freshwater Ecosystem: Risk to Food Security and Human Health,"Plastic pollution is not at all a novel matter to the scientific as well as the public community. However, the knowledge of the general public when it comes to microplastic pollution is still in its infancy. The major sources of these tiny plastic particles in the aquatic environment are laundry, abrasion of household plastics, cosmetics, personal care products, tyre wear, food wrappings, and so on. However, the public is not much aware that they are part of these major emission sources and how much they are contributing to it. Also, the vast majority of research conducted to date on plastic pollution in all size fractions has focused more on marine ecosystems than freshwater ecosystems. Hence, people are more associated with freshwater ecosystems than marine ecosystems; it should be given additional importance.Rather than the effect on aquatic organisms through ingestion and other ways, the ecological risks posed by micro and nanoplastics as vectors for chemical contaminants and their accumulation through trophic transfer are more serious and of utmost importance. Aquatic life or aquatic ecosystem is already affected by a multitude of environmental stressors, and now microplastics and nanoplastics may represent a significant additional risk to food security. Micro and nanoplastics have already invaded our diet in various ways. Even if it does not show any immediate effect on human health, long-term exposure may pose a serious threat to the human population. Hence, identifying the possible sources and reducing exposure to these sources is of utmost importance. © 2022 Haritha Thulaseedharan Nair and Siddhuraju Perumal.",Not About Sufficiency

Reflections on world water week 2016,"Dhesigen Naidoo, CEO, WRC, shares his views on the World Water Week 2016 (WWW2016). WWW2016 is the annual gathering of thought leaders, policy makers, advocacy groups and academics in Stockholm, Sweden to deliberate on the global water scarcity and poor quality challenges. WWW2016 demonstrates an important recognition of the imminent competition for skills and resources between the different United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) teams in pursuit of the 17 individual goals. The water and sanitation community of practice has to reach out to the other sectors in a more deliberate and meaningful way, while becoming prominent players in facilitating the pursuit of the related SDGs, while water is both a connector and an enabler to achieve and empower the complete SDG suite.",Not About Sufficiency
Factors Affecting the Choice and Level of Adaptation Strategies Among Smallholder Farmers in KwaZulu Natal Province,"Smallholder vegetable farmers grow diverse crops for family use and surplus sales. These farming activities contribute to enhancing local food security and the economy, but the farmers face challenges like limited resources and climate vulnerability. These smallholder farmers are more susceptible to climate variability and therefore need effective adaptation strategies to mitigate the challenges. This study sought to determine the factors that influence the choice and level of adaptation strategies among smallholder vegetable farmers in KwaZulu Natal Province. Primary data utilized in this study were obtained from 200 participants that were selected through random sampling. The descriptive results indicated that the majority of the farmers experienced climate variability and employed carbon and water-smart agricultural practices. The study employed the Multivariate Probit Model and Count Data Model/GLM Correlation Test to analyze the adaptation strategies and the level of their implementation by the selected vegetable farmers. The first hurdle of the probit model results showed that education level and land size positively and significantly influence smallholder farmers’ adaptation strategies, while marital status, household size, income source, soil type, membership of the association, and supply chain involvement had a significant and negative effect on adoption of adaptation strategies. The results from the second hurdle showed that household size, the total size of land used for vegetable production, sandy, silt, and loam soil had a significant and negative effect on the level of adaptation strategy used, whilst the total size of land owned had a positive and significant impact on the level of adaptation strategy used by the smallholder vegetable farmers. The study concludes that education level and total land size are associated with improved farmers’ climate variability adaptative capacity. The vegetable farmers’ ability to adapt to climate variability challenges was negatively influenced by factors like marital status, household size, and soil type negatively impacted these strategies. The study recommends that the government considerably supports the Climate Smart Agriculture initiatives, such as alternatives like hot houses, training, credit access, and sustainable practices to enhance farmers’ resilience and national food security. These may include but are not limited to alternatives like hot houses, as well as addressing barriers through training, credit access, and sustainable practices to enhance farmers’ resilience and national food security. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The potential contribution and challenges of edible grasshopper (Ruspolia differens) to food and nutrition security in Uganda- a literature review,"Insects are being considered a sustainable protein food source for the future to forestall the impending world protein shortage, exacerbated by population growth and climate change. The edible grasshopper Ruspolia differens, a high protein insect traditionally consumed in East Africa- particularly in Central Uganda presents an opportunity for local solutions to food and nutritional security. This literature review consolidates research information, mainly derived from peer reviewed articles on online databases, on potential distribution, demand, importance, food safety hazards and, handling and research efforts that support safety of consumption. Key documented findings are that Ruspolia differens is highly nutritious and a source of livelihood. Their geographical distribution is expected to widen, increasing availability and access. Food safety hazards from their handling include high counts of bacterial species, yeasts and molds, heavy metals, and a potential for inherent allergens yet the demand and supply chains are expanding. Consequently, a strategy involving all stakeholders is required to support food safety along the value chain. Understanding the contribution of Ruspolia differens and minimising obstacles to its exploitation should be a research priority in order to promote the adoption, value addition, and development of insect-derived products aimed at nontraditional insect-eating communities and those who are severely food insecure. © 2023, East African Science and Technology Commission - EASTECO KG.

Response of nutritional water productivity in okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) seeds to irrigation interval,"Nutritional water productivity (NWP), which quantifies nutrition in produce per volume of water, is an approach for providing empirical information on incidents of malnutrition as affected by various cultural practices in crop production. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of irrigation interval on NWP in okra seeds under warm-arid regions. Hardened-off okra seedlings were transplanted under field conditions and subjected to 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-and 14-day irrigation interval, with 2 000 ml tapwater/seedling. At 59 days after transplanting, pods were harvested and pods shelled, with seed samples prepared for NWP-related tests. Pods were dried at 60 for 72 h for dry matter determination. Irrigation interval had highly significant effects on yield, evapotranspiration (ETa) and water use efficiency (WUE), contributing 75, 96 and 87% in total treatment variation of the respective variables. Relative to Day-2, yield and WUE were significantly higher on Day-8, but were not significantly different to those in Day-14. However, ETa was significantly higher on Day-2 than in all other irrigation intervals. Irrigation interval had highly significant effects on NWP of Ca, K, Mag, P, Cu, Fe, Mn, Na and Zn, contributing from 84 to 89% in total treatment variation on the respective variables. Relative to Day-2, Day-8 NWP variables were significantly higher than those at lower or higher irrigation intervals, where NWP values were significantly reduced. In conclusion, results in the current study suggested that Day-8 irrigation interval was suitable for improving NWP of okra under existing conditions. © 2025, Gaurav Publications.

Influence of irrigation intervals on essential nutrient content in okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) seeds,"The influence of irrigation intervals on the accumulation of essential nutrients in okra seeds, especially those intended for coffee production, has not been thoroughly documented. This study aimed to investigate the effects of irrigation intervals on essential nutrient levels in okra seeds. By exploring how different irrigation schedules impact nutrient content, this research aims to optimize water use and enhance seed quality to meet the growing demand for nutrient-dense food products. The present study was conducted during late summer (December-January) 2022 and validated in 2023 at the Green Biotechnologies Research Centre of Excellence (GBRCE), University of Limpopo, Limpopo Province, South Africa (23°53’10""S, 29°44’15""E). Okra seedlings were subjected to irrigation intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 days, with each interval replicated 10 times. Each seedling received 2,000 mL of tap water per irrigation. At 59 days after transplanting, pods were harvested and shelled, with seed samples prepared for the determination of malnutrition essential element tests. Calcium, K, Mg, and P versus irrigation interval exhibited quadratic relations with the model explained by 80, 78, 79, and 77% associations, respectively. Similarly, Cu, Fe, Na, Mn, and Zn versus irrigation interval exhibited quadratic relations, with the model explained by 71, 86, 79, 81, and 68% associations, respectively. Using x = –b1/2b2 relation, the average optimal irrigation intervals for macro and micronutrient elements were 9 and 8 days, respectively, with the average suggesting that the Day-8 irrigation interval was suitable for improving malnutrition essential elements of okra seeds under field conditions. © 2024, Gaurav Publications.

"Sundown and ""liquid modernity"" in pawhuska, Oklahoma","The early twentieth-century oil boom radically transformed the Osage reservation in Oklahoma, and in the early 1920s the Osages became the world's richest community because of their collective sharing of profits from mineral resources. In 1934, John Joseph Mathews, an Osage American tribal historian, published Sundown, his only work of fiction, a peculiar Bildungsroman about the life of Chal Windzer in the aftermath of oil discovery on the Osage reservation. I argue that Mathews's use of the novel of formation is a particularly important literary and intellectual intervention. First, at a time when the significance of material resources to the American economy and American national imaginary was growing, Mathews uses the generic convention of progress to narrate oil's social ""formation,"" alongside the tale of Chal's dissolution, his failure, that is, of the very development which the novel's genre implies. Second, Mathews's literary representation of the oil boom as the Great Frenzy - a period of widespread violence and cultural chaos - complicates traditional accounts of capitalist economic development, which define late-stage capitalism and its financial deregulation and IT boom as an era of radical cultural ""fluidity"" (Bauman, Sennett). By drawing attention to the material and social fluidity of oil culture and the force with which it affected the Osages, Sundown points to a specific Osage American colonial, and thus always already transnational, history of (petro)modernity. The character of modernity, Mathews shows us, is inextricably tied to the conditions under which human and natural resources are extracted and allowed to become ""social."" The destabilization of reservation culture derives equally from oil discovery itself, and the technological transformations within the energy industry, from the colonialist conditions that impose capitalism upon the Osages, and from the very collectivist modes of wealth distribution that the Osages adopted in order to resist colonial exploitation. Thus Mathews's novel reveals an alternative genealogy of the destabilization of cultural forms to the one that begins with post-Bretton Woods global financial deregulation, the collapse of state institutions in the global North, and the late twentieth-century emergence of new communication technologies. For the Osages in the 1920s and for the characters in Sundown, crude oil and colonial exploitation, as well as, paradoxically, anticapitalist legal provisions of the Allotment Act's collectivizing of it, make reservation culture ""liquid"" and ""uncertain"" precisely at the time of America's entering into the presumably ""solid"" econo-political phase of development. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.",Not About Sufficiency
"Fresh water resource, scarcity, water salinity challenges and possible remedies: A review","Water is one of the natural resource due balance if our planet and the life on it have to sustain and economic development to be expected in the future. The increase in population of the world and level of wealth of humans is expected to withdraw more freshwater. However, since water is already one of the limited resources, global per capital water available surely drops and water shortage happens. Pollution of ground and surface water by dissolved salts are increasing and exacerbating this water shortage situation. The sources of these dissolved salts (such as primary and secondary salinity-causing agents) are known to change the chemical constituent of water. Once contributing factors for water scarcity are identified, future man should work on it to overcome the challenge. This paper therefore began with global water resource information and indicated different levels of scarcity to give overall clues on the situation. Salinity description, its global status, causative factors and challenges were revised before possible recommendations were indicated as indispensable solution. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Creating positive synergies between risk management and transfer to accelerate food system climate resilience,"Climate change will significantly impact the future viability and security of food production systems, with increased frequency and intensity of droughts, floods, storms and other extreme climatic events predicted in many regions. In order for food production systems to remain viable and resilient under a changing climate, novel approaches, which integrate risk management (i.e. adaptation) and risk transfer strategies, such as insurance, are required. We argue that the coordinated integration of risk management and risk transfer approaches will support greater resilience of food production systems under climate change. Conversely, if risk management and risk transfer strategies are not carefully integrated, there is potential to undermine adaptive capacity (e.g. insurance subsidies may dissuade farmers from investing in climate adaptation) and ultimately reduce the capacity of food production systems to cope with and recover from the adverse impacts of climate change. Here we propose a resilience-based conceptual framework for integrating risk management and risk transfer strategies along with four key principles, which we believe could underlie their successful integration and thus enhance food production system resilience under climate change. These are as follows: (1) pro-active investments in farmer climate adaptation rather than re-active disaster relief, (2) structuring of government subsidies around insurance and climate disaster relief to incentivise farmer climate adaptation, (3) rewarding farmer efforts towards climate adaptation with cheaper insurance premiums for those farmers that invest resources into climate adaptation and (4) recognising investments in the integration of farm climate adaptation and risk transfer schemes within the broader context of future climate disaster risk management and global food security. Such an integrated investment approach could substantially reduce future economic losses for farmers while also enhancing food security under climate change. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Progress and Updates of CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing on Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Agriculture: A Review,"Sugar crops, namely sugarcane, sugar beet and sweet sorghum, rank among the top essential crops for both food and industry globally, yet their production is impeded by considerable abiotic stresses. Abiotic stresses, which include drought, salinity, temperature fluctuations and stress from heavy metals, pose a global challenge to agricultural production and productivity by threatening human food security and livelihoods. To address this issue, genome editing is widely adopted to create abiotic stress-resilient crops in order to increase crop yield. Fortunately, recent technologies like CRISPR/Cas9—clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated system/CRISPR-associated endonuclease genome editing are effective in creating abiotic stress-resistant varieties, which will be useful for producers to withstand challenging climatic conditions. It allows researchers to evade the prolonged process of traditional breeding and change the genome in a much shorter period. CRISPR/Cas9 is a renowned, powerful genome-editing tool and is beneficial in biological research since it may change the genome in several ways. It has unlocked new possibilities for plant breeding and carries the capability to revolutionise the field. This paper reviews the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in enhancing abiotic stress tolerant designer crops with the aim of enhancing their quality. In this review, we have highlighted the various gene-editing techniques, mechanism and classification of CRISPR system and its applications against abiotic stress in various crops including a special reference of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in sugar crops. The implementation of the CRISPR/Cas9 technique will support the sustainable agriculture and maximise yield by tackling the environmental stresses. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society for Sugar Research & Promotion 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Biochar-Soil-Plant interactions: A cross talk for sustainable agriculture under changing climate,"Biochars provide several agricultural and environmental benefits, such as soil health improvement, better crop growth and yield, carbon sequestration, decreasing greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, and regulation of nutrient dynamics. This review highlights the role of biochar in transforming the soil’s physiochemical and biological properties, and their impact on improving seed germination and seedling growth, altering crop physiological attributes, enhancing crop resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses, improving crop productivity, curtailing GHGs, and controlling nutrient leaching losses. However, the type of feedstock used, pyrolysis temperature, application rate and method, soil type and crop species largely influence the biochar performance under different environmental conditions. Application of biochars at low rates help to promote seed germination and seedling growth. Biochar modified the abiotic and microbial processes in the rhizosphere and increased nutrient mineralization and enhanced the nutrient availability for plant uptake. Hence, biochar enhanced the plant resistance against diseases, reduced the availability of heavy metals and improved the plant resilience against environmental stressors. By providing a comprehensive analysis about the variable impacts of biochars on soil physicochemical properties, plant growth, development and productivity and mitigating environmental problems, this review is quite valuable for developing an efficient soil and crop specific biochar with desired functionalities. It could be helpful in improving crop productivity, ensuring food security and better management of environment. Furthermore, this review identifies the knowledge gaps and suggests future outlooks for the commercialization of biochar applications on large-scale.

Climate change and political (in)action: an intergenerational epistemic divide?,"This paper critically examines the constructed narrative that there is an epistemic intergenerational divide on the topic of climate change, climate science, and the political actions necessary to address the most urgent threats. Analysing publicly available social media data, this paper traces the amplification of youth voice during 2019 and the emergence of this narrative. It compares the dominant messages against 2019 Afrobarometer and Eurobarometer reports which explore voter perspectives on climate change and climate action. Through a process of critical analysis it argues that the constructed narrative of an intergenerational epistemic divide is misleading. It argues that youth voices are subject to structural forms of epistemic injustice and exclusion in climate action deliberations and policy making. However, it finds that voters and older generations are also subject to similar forms of exclusion. Rather than framing this as an epistemic problem, this analysis points to the political-economy climate justice factors influencing the debate. It argues that the real points of contention now rest at the science-policy interface and with what happens when scientific evidence is refracted through dominant political ideologies and translated into policy. © 2021 The Author(s).

Water footprint assessment within a catchment: A case study for Upper Tigris River Basin,"Substantial amount of world's population experiences severe water scarcity problems. The water scarcity related threats on food security, human health and natural ecosystem are estimated to increase in the future, due to unconscious use and overutilization of water resources. Water footprint assessment studies at basin level are very important and provide a key role for sustainable development of freshwater resources especially in arid and semi-arid regions. However, comprehensive studies on water footprint assessment of river basins are quite limited due to requirement of wide-range of statistical data. The main scope of this study is to analyze the blue and green water footprint of Upper Tigris River Basin (UTRB, Turkey) with a bottom-up approach for the years between 2010 and 2018. Water footprints of agricultural production, livestock production and industrial plus domestic water use have been separately studied. Total blue and green water footprints, per capita water footprints and virtual water contents of the major crops harvested in the UTRB were calculated and compared with surrounding countries. A sustainability assessment based on the scarcity indicators has also been provided. Annual water footprint of UTRB is calculated as 7.2 Gm3/yr for the specified time interval corresponding 1748 m3/cap/yr. Crop production has the highest share with 79% of total water footprint. Wheat is the primary crop cultivated in the study area and responsible for 45% of consumptive water use of all crops. The livestock and domestic plus industrial water footprint were obtained as 16% and 5% of the complete basin's water footprint, respectively. Annual blue water scarcity of the basin is obtained to be 87% which is classified as low scarcity. The findings of this study are expected to increase water allocation efficiency and sustainability of the study area. It is also expected to contribute the integrated basin management studies and cooperation between riparian countries for better planning and management of transboundary water resources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Ecosystem service dependence in livestock and crop-based production systems in Asia's high mountains,"Globally, in semi-arid and arid landscapes, there is an ongoing transition from livestock-production systems to crop-production systems, and in many parts of Asia's arid mountains, mining for minerals is also increasing. These changes are accompanied by a change in the generation and quality of ecosystem services (ES), which can impact human well-being. In this study, to better understand the impacts of such transitions, we quantified ES in two crop-based and three livestock-based production systems in the arid and semi-arid landscapes of the High Himalaya and Central Asia, specifically in the Indian Himalaya, Kyrgyz Tien Shan, and Mongolian Altai. Our results showed 1) high economic dependence (3.6–38 times the respective annual household income) of local farmers on provisioning ES, with the economic value of ES being greater in livestock-production systems (7.4–38 times the annual household income) compared to crop-production systems (3.6–3.7 times the annual household income); 2) ES input into cashmere production, the main commodity from the livestock-production systems, was 13–18 times greater than the price of cashmere received by the farmer; and 3) in the livestock production systems affected by mining, impacts on ES and quality of life were reported to be negative by majority of the respondents. We conclude that livestock-based systems may be relatively more vulnerable to degrading impacts of mining and other ongoing developments due to their dependence on larger ES resource catchments that tend to have weaker land tenure and are prone to fragmentation. In contrast to the general assumption of low value of ES in arid and semi-arid landscapes due to relatively low primary productivity, our study underscores the remarkably high importance of ES in supporting local livelihoods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Simulating the impact of no-till systems on field water fluxes and maize productivity under semi-arid conditions,"Crop output from the smallholder farming sector in sub-Saharan Africa is trailing population growth leading to widespread household food insecurity. It is therefore imperative that crop production in semi-arid areas be improved in order to meet the food demand of the ever increasing human population. No-till farming practices have the potential to increase crop productivity in smallholder production systems of sub-Saharan Africa, but rarely do because of the constraints experienced by these farmers. One of the most significant of these is the consumption of mulch by livestock. In the absence of long term on-farm assessment of the no-till system under smallholder conditions, simulation modelling is a tool that provides an insight into the potential benefits and can highlight shortcomings of the system under existing soil, climatic and socio-economic conditions. Thus, this study was designed to better understand the long term impact of no-till system without mulch cover on field water fluxes and maize productivity under a highly variable rainfall pattern typical of semi-arid South Africa. The simulated on-farm experiment consisted of two tillage treatments namely oxen-drawn conventional ploughing (CT) and ripping (NT). The APSIM model was applied for a 95. year period after first being calibrated and validated using measured runoff and maize yield data. The predicted results showed significantly higher surface runoff from the conventional system compared to the no-till system. Predicted deep drainage losses were higher from the NT system compared to the CT system regardless of the rainfall pattern. However, the APSIM model predicted 62% of the annual rainfall being lost through soil evaporation from both tillage systems. The predicted yields from the two systems were within 50kgha-1 difference in 74% of the years used in the simulation. In only 9% of the years, the model predicted higher grain yield in the NT system compared to the CT system. It is suggested that NT systems may have great potential for reducing surface runoff from smallholder fields and that the NT systems may have potential to recharge groundwater resources through increased deep drainage. However, it was also noted that the APSIM model has major shortcomings in simulating the water balance at this level of detail and that the findings need to be confirmed by further field based and modelling studies. Nevertheless, it is clear that without mulch or a cover crop, the continued high soil evaporation and correspondingly low crop yields suggest that there is little benefit to farmers adopting NT systems in semiarid environments, despite potential water resources benefits downstream. In such cases, the potential for payment for ecosystem services should be explored. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Interdependences between smallholder farming and environmental management in rural Malawi: A case of agriculture-induced environmental degradation in Malingunde Extension Planning Area (EPA),"The objective of this article was to develop a deeper understanding of the interdependences between smallholder farming and the state of environmental management in rural Malawi. We examined the agricultural local governance framework in Malingunde Extension Planning Area (EPA), its contribution to food security and how it conflicts with overall land and forest resources management. The charcoal production process was discussed in line with its implications for agricultural production and environmental sustainability. The smallholder households employ inappropriate land management practices, engage in agricultural production on unsuitable land and use fertile soils, timber and firewood for brick production and construction and secondly engage in charcoal production (deforestation) as a coping mechanism against food deficiency. However, while detrimental in its own right, this environmental degradation in the area cannot be explicitly pinned to, for instance, the total charcoal supply being out of balance with wood stocks or insufficient land. It is, rather, usually due to failures to provide incentives to manage land and forest resources in a manner that allows regeneration of both the soils and wood stocks in the area. An improvement in the quality and quantity of the smallholder agriculture sector production would promote significantly the environmental management efforts. © 2014 by the authors. licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
Globalisation and climate change in Asia: The urban health impact,"Asia's economic development successes will create new policy areas to address, as the advances made through globalisation create greater climate change challenges, particularly the impact on urban health. Poverty eradication and higher standards of living both increase demand on resources. Globalisation increases inequalities and those who are currently the losers will carry the greatest burden of the costs in the form of the negative effects of climate change and the humanitarian crises that will ensue. Of four major climate change challenges affecting the environment and health, two-urban air pollution and waste management-can be mitigated by policy change and technological innovation if sufficient resources are allocated. Because of the urban bias in the development process, these challenges will probably register on policy makers' agenda. The second two major challenges-floods and drought-are less amenable to policy and technological solutions: many humanitarian emergency challenges lie ahead. This article describes the widely varying impact of both globalisation and climate change across Asia. The greatest losers are those who flee one marginal location, the arid inland areas, only to settle in another marginal location in the flood prone coastal slums. Effective preparation is required, and an effective response when subsequent humanitarian crises occur. © 2010 Third World Quarterly.",Not About Sufficiency

"Aligning the management of nature-based solutions to locally led adaptation principles: A case study of sand dams in Makueni County, Kenya","Advocates of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have argued that the approaches are important for addressing the various social and environmental challenges, including adaptation to climate change and biodiversity conservation. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has developed eight criteria for identification of Nature-based Solutions: (1) address societal challenges (2) entail landscape scale of intervention (3) biodiversity gain (4) economic viability (5) governance capability (6) equitably balance trade-offs (7) adaptive management, and (8) mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context. Nevertheless, studies have shown that interventions that seek to help people in the frontlines of climate change often fail to provide predictable financing, enable local ownership, and align to the actual conditions of the local communities. To address these challenges, in 2018 more than 20 countries formed a global commission on adaptation, which in 2021 adopted eight guidelines known as Locally Led Adaptation (LLA) principles to guide climate change adaptation efforts by ensuring that local communities are empowered to lead the design, implementation, and decision-making processes for adaptation projects. While NbS offer substantial co-benefits—enhancing biodiversity, supporting livelihoods, and improving water security—their success hinges on effective financing, governance, and local engagement. Sand dams, in particular, have been implemented for decades across arid and semi-arid regions, offering a reliable method of water harvesting and climate adaptation. However, their integration into NbS frameworks and LLA principles remains underexplored. As such, this study sets out to assess how one of the sub-national governments of Kenya (Makueni County) has aligned its implementation of Nature-based Solutions to the principles of LLA. The NbS under consideration is the county's sand dam project, which was instituted to address water scarcity in the face of climate change and inadvertently disaster risk management. To gauge the NbS project's alignment to LLA principles, 43 indicators and measurement metrics were developed based on the eight principles of LLA. Each principle has between 4 and 7 qualitative indicators. Data was collected through focus group discussions with sand dams’ projects’ committee members, key informant interviews with county and national government officials responsible for water and climate change, and analysis of the sand dams’ projects documents. Each indicator was assigned a score of 1 if present and 0 if absent, giving a potential of 43 positive scores or 100 % if the county government scored 1 for all the 43 indicators. From indicators assessed, the County Government had a positive score in about 53 %, slightly above average (50 %). It is the view of the authors’ that if better governance structures are pegged to the remaining LLA principles, then financing can flow more naturally to the water sector. © 2025 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of potential implications of agricultural irrigation policy on surface water scarcity in Brazil,"Expanding irrigated cropping areas is one of Brazil's strategies to increase agricultural production. This expansion is constrained by water policy goals to restrict water scarcity to acceptable levels. We therefore analysed the trade-off between levels of acceptable water scarcity and feasible expansion of irrigation. The appropriateness of water use in agricultural production was assessed in categories ranging from acceptable to very critical based on the river flow that is equalled or exceeded 95% of the time (Q95) as an indicator for physical water availability. The crop water balance components were determined for 166 842 subcatchments covering all of Brazil. The crops considered were cotton, rice, sugarcane, bean, cassava, corn, soybean and wheat, together accounting for 96% of the harvested area of irrigated and rain-fed agriculture. On currently irrigated land irrigation must be discontinued on 54% (2.3 Mha) for an acceptable water scarcity level, on 45% (1.9 Mha) for a comfortable water scarcity level and on 35% (1.5 Mha) for a worrying water scarcity level, in order to avoid critical water scarcity. An expansion of irrigated areas by irrigating all 45.6 Mha of the rain-fed area would strongly impact surface water resources, resulting in 26.0 Mha experiencing critical and very critical water scarcity. The results show in a spatially differentiated manner that potential future decisions regarding expanding irrigated cropping areas in Brazil must, while pursuing to intensify production practices, consider the likely regional effects on water scarcity levels, in order to reach sustainable agricultural production. © Author(s) 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
The effects of drinking water service fragmentation on drought-related water security,"Drought is a critical stressor that contributes to water insecurity. In the United States, an important pathway by which drought affects households' access to clean, reliable drinking water for basic needs is through the organization and activities of community water systems. Research on the local political economy of drinking water provision reveals the constraints on community water systems that affect their performance when confronting drought hazards. Fragmentation in responsibility for drinking water contributes to disparities in drought vulnerability, preparation, and response across households and across communities. The nature and extent of these disparities require further investigation to identify strategies for expanding water security in the face of drought and other water hazards. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

"Exposure to household air pollution and childhood multimorbidity risk in Jimma, Ethiopia","Background: Childhood multimorbidity, characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of multiple medical conditions in children, is a global concern. Notably, exposure to household air pollution has been linked to various health issues, particularly affecting vulnerable segments of the population residing in poorly ventilated homes. However, evidence regarding the impact of household air pollution on the risk of multimorbidity in low-income settings remains scarce. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between household air pollution and childhood multimorbidity in Jimma, Ethiopia. Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data from 280 children under the age of five who lived in households using solid fuel (n = 140) and clean fuel (n = 140). The Demographic Health Survey morbidity questionnaire was used to collect information from mothers about common childhood illnesses. Multiple logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the relationship between the use of solid fuel for cooking in households and the likelihood of childhood multimorbidity. In addition, Poisson regression estimation was used to determine if exposure to solid fuel could increase the number of morbidities. Results: The overall prevalence of childhood multimorbidity was 34.3% [95% CI: 0.29–0.40]. Among these cases, 23.9% were among children from solid fuel user households, whereas about 10.4% were from clean fuel user households. Adjusted for all possible socioeconomic, demographic, water, sanitation, hygiene, and health care covariates, children living in solid fuel user households had more than three times the odds of childhood multimorbidity compared to children living in clean fuel user households (AOR = 3.14, 95% CI [1.42–6.95], p < 0.001). Moreover, household air pollution from solid fuel use was positively associated with an increased number of individual morbidity conditions, with an adjusted β coefficient of 0.46 (IRR = 1.58, 95% CI [1.17–2.13], p = 0.003). Conclusion: Solid fuel use was an independent predictor of childhood morbidity risk. Efficient policies and strategies, such as the integration of environmental regulation policies into the healthcare system aimed at the reduction of harmful air pollutants and their adverse health effects on children, need to be implemented.

Under(mining) the Kondhs: a normative critique of the case of Niyamgiri,"The article explores the broader question of how to assess socioeconomic development from a normative perspective, especially in relation to indigenous peoples, by perusing a case study. The case of Niyamgiri indicates how mining of natural resources for the sake of economic development negatively impacts the lives of the Kondhs, a community of indigenous peoples who reside in the region. Most conversations regarding it have revolved around the issues of displacement, cultural genocide, debilitating ecological effects in the region, and a social movement's ability to thwart overtures of global capital. I choose John Rawls's account of distributive justice to analyse the case because it is a political conception of justice, which can accommodate claims that arise even from the premises of culture. I use it to argue that the practice of development evinced by the case fails to meet the requirements of distributive justice. In my analysis, I show that development in Niyamgiri denies its stakeholders their basic liberties, fails to provide them with fair equality of opportunity, and does not adhere to egalitarian standards of distribution reflected by the difference principle, leading ultimately to a denial of their self-respect. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Communication strategy of transboundary air pollution findings in a US-Mexico Border XXI program project,"From 1996 to 1997, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) conducted an air quality study known as the Lower Rio Grande Valley Transboundary Air Pollution Project (TAPP). The study was a US-Mexico Border XXI program project and was developed in response to local community requests on a need for more air quality measurements and concerns about the health impact of local air pollutants; this included concerns about emissions from border-dependent industries in Mexico, known as maquiladoras. The TAPP was a follow-up study to environmental monitoring done by EPA in this area in 1993 and incorporated scientific and community participation in development, review of results, and public presentation of findings. In spite of this, critical remarks were leveled by community activists against the study's preliminary ""good news"" findings regarding local air quality and the influence of transboundary air pollution. To resolve these criticisms and to refine the findings to address these concerns, analyses included comparisons of daily and near realtime measurements to TNRCC effects screening levels and data from other studies along with wind sector analyses. Reassessment of the data suggested that although regional source emissions occurred and outliers of elevated pollutant levels were found, movement of air pollution across the border did not appear to cause noticeable deterioration of air quality. In spite of limitations stated to the community, the TAPP was presented as establishing a benchmark to assess current and future transboundary air quality in the Valley. The study has application in Border XXI Program or other air quality studies where transboundary transport is a concern since it involved interagency coordination, public involvement, and communication of scientifically sound results for local environmental protection efforts.",Not About Sufficiency
Financial inclusion in the Global South: an analysis of index-based agricultural insurance and farmer food security in India,"Index-based agricultural insurance (IBAI) is presented by several development organisations as a highly effective way of mitigating climate change-related risks and improving farmer food security. However, critics doubt the effectiveness of the instrument and regard it as a new frontier for capital accumulation. Linking to this debate, this research uses a qualitative design to investigate how IBAI affects the food production and consumption of farmers in the Indian state of Karnataka. It finds that the proposed benefits of the instrument are overestimated. Most of the major issues reported by farmers cannot be addressed by insurance. Moreover, using the alternative concept of food sovereignty, the research suggests that several problems reported by interviewees, such as unstable market prices, unequal land distribution and missing irrigation, require political action rather than financial inclusion. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological balance emerges in implementing the water-energy-food security nexus in well-developed countries in Africa,"Although many African countries have made significant progress towards universal access to water, energy, and food resources (WEF), assessing the ecological response to the increasing productivity of these resources is not well researched, which carries the risk of ecological deficit, resource degradation, and inefficient policy responses to resource management. This study seeks to assess the ecological sustainability response to the high increase demand for WEF resources in well-developed African countries. The study developed new measurement metrics for the WEF production system, including three indicators of ecological footprint (EF), ecological biocapacity (EBC), and eco-balance. The overall analysis considers data from four distinct types of water and energy use activities, and eight distinct types of food consumption, in nine African countries with the highest WEF nexus performance. An evaluation tool for the Water, Energy, Food and Ecological Balance (WEFEB) nexus index is proposed as one of the study's outcomes. Despite having 100% access to WEF resources related to the SDG targets. The results reveal the significant levels of imbalance and large ecological deficits existing in many of the concerned countries, especially North Africa, Mauritius, and South Africa, which need to rethink their economic models. Projecting a sustained increase in resource demand so that each country achieves at least 1700 m3/capita/year as the minimum amount of water needed, most countries would suffer from a steady increase in ecological imbalance. According to the results, managing the ecological imbalances with increasing demand for WEF resources in well-developed African countries may require well-designed policies to effectively reduce certain types of human demand that have a large ecological footprint. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Climate change adaptation and water in semi- arid regions: A case study of the limpopo basin, Southern Africa","Water is widely recognized as the primary medium through which climate change affects the environment and human livelihoods that depend on it (UN-Water, 2010). Climate catastrophes are unavoidable and in most cases the resultant loss of balance in human-environment systems has disproportionate negative effects on the poor. Several factors compound the impacts of climate change and undermine people’s adaptive capacity in Africa. These include weak economies, inadequate infrastructure, poverty, high illiteracy levels, weak institutions, limited access to technology and information and extreme dependency on natural resources. While the link between water and climate change is clear, many other serious effects of climate change like food insecurity, rapid urbanization and energy crises are arbitrated via water (Rogers, 2008). For example, crops rely on soil moisture from rainfall or irrigation for growth. Communities sorely dependent on rainfall for a livelihood become extremely vulnerable as rainfall declines and they will naturally seek change. This will result in a domino effect on people’s livelihoods, such as increased rural to urban migration and limited economic growth, among others. The importance of water to life and livelihoods can therefore not be overstated. Climate change adaptation is to a large extent about adaptation of water management (Stern, 2007). Africa, with a total of 63 shared river basins covering about 64 per cent of the continental area (UNEP, 2010) faces formidable social, economic and environmental threats to livelihoods presented by the interaction of climate change effects and managing these shared but limited water resources. One of the shared river basins is the largely semi-arid Limpopo Basin in southern Africa (Figure 10.1). The basin is a good case study where the major challenge is balancing human and environment systems in the face of water needs for economic development and for maintaining the stability of ecosystems. It is therefore becoming increasingly important for the basin’s people to focus on water-related adaptation strategies in response to climate change. © 2015 Dominic Stucker and Elena Lopez-Gunn.",Not About Sufficiency
Household food security of rainfed-rice farmers in Sragen District to achieve sustainable development goals,"Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals is Zero Hunger or ensure food security in the world. This study aims to determine households' food security in Sragen District using descriptive and analytical methods with survey techniques. The research was conducted in Gemolong Sub-district, Sragen District. The determination of village samples is done deliberately (purposive) considering the largest rainfed rice fields. The data analysis used is the analysis of energy consumption and household food security. The results showed that the energy consumption of farmers' households amounted to 6,041 kcal/day with an energy sufficiency value of 5,368 kcal/day, then obtained energy consumption level of 113% and classified in the category of high level because energy consumption level = 100%. Household food security conditions showed that 53.33% were food resistant households and 46.67% were food vulnerable. Increasing production and household income by optimizing drill wells to ensure water availability or procurement of seeds resistant to rainfed rice fields can address vulnerable food situations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of Environmental Regulation Competition and Public Participation on Enterprise Location Selection Under Climate Change in COVID-19 Pandemic Conditions: An Analysis Based on the Chinese Provincial Spatial Panel Model,"The deterioration of environmental quality has attracted the attention of the Chinese government and the public. The Chinese government has delegated part of the power of environmental regulation to local governments. To fulfill the KPI, local governments tend to loosen environmental regulations to attract more settlement of enterprises, thus leading to an increasingly fierce local environmental regulation competition. The improvement of people’s living standards makes it possible for the public to participate in environmental regulation. This article seeks to carry out the empirical study to interpret the relationship between local environmental regulation competition, public participation, and enterprise location selection through a random effects (RE) spatial Durbin model with 29 provincial panel data in China from 2004 to 2017. The results show that the provincial spatial spillover effect of enterprise location selection is significant. More intensified local environmental regulation competition can attract more investment but may harm sustainable economic development. Active public participation can effectively avoid the excessive investment caused by local environmental regulation competition and sustain economic development. Therefore, we should establish and improve the local environmental prevention and regulation system and establish an information disclosure mechanism to ensure public participation. The local government’s environmental regulation and public participation mechanism should be effectively coordinated. Copyright © 2022 Mu, Zhan, Ameer, Anser, Zeng and Amin.",Not About Sufficiency
The adaptive capacity of smallholder mixed-farming systems to the impact of climate change: The case of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa,"Climate change poses a serious threat to efforts by developing countries to ensure food security and poverty reduction. The National Development goals of South Africa envisage the agricultural sector as a key driver for job creation and economic growth. This article seeks to investigate the adaptive capacity of the Ncunjane farming community in Msinga, KwaZulu- Natal in response to drought spells of 2010 and 2014. This article draws on data collected using both qualitative and quantitative methods in 2011 and later in 2015 with the data analysed through the Statistical Package for Social Science to determine significant correlations between variables. Analysis of the vulnerability and adaptive capacity is performed using conceptual framework. This study found that both smallholder farmers who engaged in livestock and crop production have experienced high cattle mortalities and stagnant crop productivity, which in turn put pressure on already constrained disposable household income because of increased food costs and agricultural input costs, particularly supplementary animal feed. Cattle owners were more vulnerable to drought because of poor risk management and thus became highly dependent on government to provide drought relief. Application for government drought relief was found not to be effective in cases of large herds of cattle. Variability of rainfall and prolonged heat spells has a significant impact on the sustainability of smallholder mixed-farming systems, leaving agriculture as a highly questionable form of livelihood for rural farming communities such as Msinga. The article recommends strengthened institutional mechanisms so that stakeholders should play a more meaningful role within provincial and local agriculture in leveraging government support but places emphasis on the adoption of innovative strategies that can potentially yield significantly resilient smallholder mixed-farming systems in the wake of climate variability. © 2017.

Reducing Vulnerability of Rain-fed Cereal Production through Crop Simulation Modelling,"Smallholder rain-fed cereal cropping systems in semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate variability and change. The poor productivity of rain-fed staple cereals threatens the smallholder food security and livelihoods. Government agencies, researchers, and development partners are concerned about the limited impact of current adaptation strategies. The matching of farm-level adaptation practices with the anticipated rise in temperature and more extreme weather events has remained contentious. While crop simulation models (CSM) are considered essential tools to devise a management system appropriate for climate change adaptation, smallholder rain-fed systems still face significant trade-offs between continuing with sole traditional agricultural experimentation and incorporating the CSMs. Reduced vulnerability of smallholder rain-fed cereal production results from farmers adopting feasible adaptation strategies informed by CSMs. This, in turn, improves yields and increases profits. Further, the involvement of state-of-the-art approaches in agricultural research and management determines the devising and choice of robust climate change adaptation strategies. Recognizing the large potential for smallholder rain-fed cereal cropping systems’ improvement, such critical methodologies need to be developed which include but not limited to use of CSMs. Enhanced understanding of the impacts of climate change culminates in reducing the vulnerability of smallholder farmers. The goal of this contribution is to elucidate on CSMs application in developing and implementing farm-level adaptation practices required to offset the envisioned adverse impacts due to climate change and, consequently, improving rain-fed cereal crop productivity. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Conservation Agriculture as Sustainable and Smart Soil Management: When Food Systems Meet Sustainability,"Soils, central component of terrestrial ecosystems, are at the nexus of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and hence healthy soils and sustainable soil management are the necessities for food and nutrition security, human well-being and economic stability and prosperity and therefore play the key roles for sustainable development. However, plant and animal growth and productivity and hence food security are still adversely affected by water scarcity and climate and environmental change. Conservation agriculture (CA), a systemic and agro-ecological approach, has gained prominence in recent years amongst farmers, scholars, international organizations, and policy-makers. CA systems upheld to enhance the production capacity of soils while mitigating environmental impacts and reversing decline in soil degradation. CA systems have proven to improve sustainability of farming systems across a wide range of climates and soils through lessening farming costs, soil security, carbon sequestration, and the delivery ecosystem services. The aim of this review is to highlight these issues and analyze associated impacts through an understanding of the functioning of soils and their management in relation to CA principles in order to sustain and secure food and feed under a changing climate and policies. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Gender gap in perspectives of the impacts of degradation and restoration on ecosystem services in Ethiopia,"The importance of land restoration has garnered increasing attention on the global stage through large-scale initiatives such as the Bonn Challenge. However, policies and strategies are often gender-blind and designed in compliance with entrenched social hierarchies, exacerbating pre-existing social inequalities that affect restoration initiatives. The challenge of developing gender-responsive policies and initiatives is accentuated by a persistent lack of sex-disaggregated data concerning men's and women's differing perceptions and experiences. This study aims to help fill this gap by capturing the differences in men and women's perceptions of ecosystem services before and after restoration interventions in Ethiopia. Towards that end, in October 2021, we collected data from fifty-nine (59) paired husband-wife households and six gender-segregated focus group discussions in two regions of Ethiopia: Amhara and Southern Nations, and Nationalities and Peoples (SNNP). Kendall's concordance analysis established a strong degree of disagreement between men's and women's ratings of restoration outcomes for most indicators. Men attributed degradation to landscape conditions and natural forces, while women considered the lack of appropriate restoration strategies as a precursor for accelerated degradation. The study also reveals that men tended to benefit more than women from enhanced ecosystem services post-restoration, with increased labour and land management burdens often falling on the shoulders of women. Based on these findings, we argue that including men's and women's perspectives from the earliest planning phases of restoration initiatives is essential to ensure greater equity in benefit-sharing, mitigate trade-offs for women, and build more nuanced, just and successful approaches to restoration. © 2023 The Authors.

Unveiling the Absence of a Local Medical Device and Biomaterials Manufacturing Industry in Zimbabwe: A Literature Review,"Medical devices and biomaterials play pivotal roles in the provision of healthcare and advancements in medicine. Zimbabwe, a low-income country in Southern Africa, faces resource constraints while combating both communicable and non-communicable diseases, which significantly contribute to the nation’s disease burden. The lack of a medical device and biomaterials manufacturing industry in Zimbabwe is a critical issue with profound implications for the country’s healthcare system and economic development. This literature review comprehensively examines the current state of medical device and biomaterials manufacturing in Zimbabwe, focusing on historical perspectives, health infrastructure, challenges, and the importance of establishing a local manufacturing industry. By analyzing barriers and constraints hindering industry growth and conducting international comparisons, successful strategies implemented by other countries are explored. Additionally, the review investigates ongoing research and development efforts, including collaborations between academic institutions and industries in the medical technology field. Furthermore, the impact of existing government policies and initiatives on the growth of the medical device and biomaterials manufacturing sector is evaluated. The review emphasizes the significance of a local manufacturing industry, as it enhances healthcare accessibility, reduces dependency on imports, and unlocks potential economic benefits. By identifying potential opportunities and providing recommendations for policymakers, investors, and stakeholders, this study advocates concerted efforts to address challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities in this critical sector. The call to action seeks to foster collaboration among relevant stakeholders to support the development of a thriving medical device and biomaterials manufacturing industry in Zimbabwe, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes and overall national progress. © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency
A survey of communication effectiveness by agricultural extension in the Gweru district of Zimbabwe,"This study is a qualitative survey of the effectiveness of communication between agricultural extension personnel and smallholder farmers in the Gweru district of Zimbabwe. Extension communication, particularly, has a large bearing on the sustainability of agricultural developments projects. The apparent lack of information, education and training during the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) of Zimbabwe contributed to low agricultural production and productivity which could consequently lead to continuing food insecurity in the country. The findings indicate a discrepancy between work experience and qualifications of the extension workers which could imply a lack in the quality of knowledge, information and skills imparted to the resettled farmers. Further findings indicate a lack of stakeholder analysis in designing agricultural communication projects and an absence of a multi-media communication approach to enhance adoption of agricultural innovations. The study concludes that agricultural extension is not adequate due to multiple resource constraints. The findings imply that agricultural communication should be integrative. A model of smallholder agriculture stakeholder mobilization has been developed to encourage effective agricultural communication and productivity therein. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

"Review: Domestic herbivores and food security: Current contribution, trends and challenges for a sustainable development","Herbivores are found in a variety of ecosystems all over the world. Permanent pastures and meadows cover about 25% of global land. We currently count one domesticated herbivore for two people in the world and the number is growing. Production systems and products are highly diverse. This high diversity is the result of thousands of years of natural selection and human-controlled breeding, as well as migration and trade. Because of the high diversity of domestic herbivore genetic resources, herders have been able to live in regions where no alternative for income generation exists. Meat and milk from domestic herbivores provide 16% and 8% of the global protein and kilocalorie consumption, respectively. They also provide a variety of essential micronutrients but can contribute to overweight and obesity when consumed in excess. Domestic herbivores also make significant contribution to food security through the production of manure, draught power and transport and the generation of income at household and national level. They have a key role to play in women's empowerment and gender equality, both in rural and urban areas. Demand for meat and milk is increasing because of population growth, rising incomes and urbanisation. This trend is expected to continue, especially in Latin America, South Asia and China. The sustainable development of domestic herbivore production needs to address the feed/food and the efficiency of herbivores in turning forages into protein. It also needs to address the contribution of herbivores to greenhouse gas emissions, especially of ruminants through enteric fermentation, and their mitigation potential, including through carbon sequestration. Animal genetic resources have a key role to play in mitigating and adapting to climate change. The role of ruminants in the circular bioeconomy needs to be enhanced, promoting the use of by-products and waste as livestock feed and the recycling of manure for energy and nutrients. Finally, the role of domestic herbivores in providing secure livelihoods and economic opportunities for millions of smallholder farmers and pastoralists needs to be enhanced. The sustainable development of the sector therefore requires adequate policies, and there are already a variety of mechanisms available, including regulations, cross-compliance systems, payments for environmental services and research and development. Priority areas for policy makers should be aligned with the global framework of the Sustainable Development Goals and include: (i) food security and nutrition, (ii) economic development and livelihoods, (iii) animal and human health and finally, (iv) environment, climate and natural resources. © Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2018.",Not About Sufficiency

"Changes in urban green space configuration and connectivity using spatial graph-based metrics in Ardabil developing city, Iran","Urban planning is essential for managing the diverse impacts of urban green spaces, such as public access, stormwater control, urban life quality, and landscape aesthetics, promoting sustainable urban development and urban residents’ well-being by integrating green space considerations into city planning. The aim of this study is to use graph-based metrics to calculate the connectivity of UGS across the main municipal zones of Ardabil city over consecutive periods under different population growth rates. Another objective of this study is to compare the connectivity values of UGS in the four municipal zones and to evaluate changes in the connectivity indices at various distance thresholds of UGS patches. After identifying UGS in different periods, the changes in graph-based connectivity indices at various distance thresholds of UGS patches were analyzed. Additionally, the changes in connectivity indices over different periods and across various municipal zones were compared and analyzed. The findings reveal that UGS areas were larger in the past but have recently had smaller patch sizes. Connectivity between UGS nodes (dNL) decreased at various distances over the study years, showing a declining trend in different connectivity indices. UGS connectivity decreased in municipal zones 1, 2, and 3 but increased in recent years after a decline until 2012 across all four zones of Ardabil city. Zone 4 had the highest UGS connectivity due to newly developed urban areas and well-allocated UGSs. Integrating the ecological impacts of UGS connectivity in urban development and design will enhance trade-offs between conservation, public health, and social equity. New urban areas should allocate sufficient land for UGS and parks, ensuring accessibility to support health and leisure through municipal planning. The study highlights the need for sustainable urban development policies that prioritize the allocation and maintenance of UGSs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

Fishery and agriculture amidst human activities and climate change in the Mekong River: A review of gaps in data and effective approaches towards sustainable development,"Fisheries and agriculture – the pillars of food security in the Lancang Mekong River Basin (LMRB) – substantially contribute to the welfare of communities in the region through international trade and local daily food sources. These sectors, however, are vulnerable to climate change as well as changes caused by the recent rising demands for food and clean energy (e.g., hydropower reservoirs). The impacts of hydropower reservoirs on the fertility of lands and fish stocks hold significant implications for the region's sustainable development. This study investigates the underlying factors driving these sectors’ current conditions and critically reviews existing approaches for the basin's food security, which have been neglected by previous studies. Indiscriminate fishing, damming, and hydrological alterations are identified as key contributors to the ongoing challenges, with varying regional priorities. Findings reveal that 83 % of fishery in the Lancang Basin is attributed to farm-raised fishery. Despite significant river fragmentation stemming from cascade dams and extensive small-scale barriers in China, there has been a significant increase (∼606 %) in Lancang mainstream fishery over the past two decades. Additionally, 54 % of riverine fish species in the lower Mekong have lost connectivity due to existing dam infrastructure. Agriculture appears to remain consistent in the Lancang Basin, while the lower Mekong experienced a significant increase in agricultural lands- a trend that is projected to rise by 65 % by the 2060s. Two primary drawbacks were identified: firstly, the use of daily data (e.g., water level and discharge) that cannot fully capture the dammed LMR dynamic flow regime; and secondly, the ignorance of telecoupling to the sub-basins, neglecting the connections either among sub-basins within the basin or extending outside of it. This paper thus advocates for a unified basin-wide study engaging all riparian countries through a transboundary water cooperation mechanism. Failure to act swiftly could result in irreversible changes to the basin in the coming decades as population growth, urbanization, and human pressures accelerate. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Urgent climate action is needed to ensure effectiveness of protected areas for biodiversity benefits,"The intertwined crises of biodiversity loss and climate change pose a significant sustainability challenge, threatening ecosystems and human well-being globally. Yet, the nuanced interplay between these challenges is often understated in policy dialogs. Global biodiversity targets, including 30% protection of the Earth's surface by 2030, may fall short without robust climate change mitigation. Here, we illustrate that conservation through protected areas can effectively preserve forest productivity and carbon capture, which depend on tree diversity. However, failing to mitigate climate change diminishes the effectiveness of these areas, especially in warmer biomes. Even with optimal protected area selection, preserving tree diversity-dependent productivity could be compromised without significant climate change mitigation. Our findings emphasize the need to integrate climate change mitigation into biodiversity conservation policies to ensure the success of the 30 × 30 targets and sustain the ecosystem benefits biodiversity provides to society. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Fire detection and anti-fire system to enhance food security: A concept of smart agriculture systems-based IoT and embedded systems with machine-to-machine protocol,"Food security has become a major concern for most countries. This is due to: 1) the growth of the world population, 2) the decline of natural resources, 3) the loss of agricultural land, and 4) the increase of unforeseen environmental conditions (storms, fires, and other natural hazards). The fire outbreak, in general, has developed into a serious concern. In the coming years, the rate of fire outbreaks could rise exponentially, requiring immediate attention to avoid loss of property and life. To resolve such an issue, a shift from the agricultural industry to smart agriculture via applications of 1) the Internet of Things (IoT), 2) embedded systems, and 3) sensors for fire prevention are required to improve operational efficiency and productivity. A fire detection and anti-fire security (FDAS) system in smart agriculture using the IoT and embedded system is proposed. The proposed system has four technology levels: 1) the edge network layer, 2) the fog network layer, 3) the cloud computing layer, and 4) the data representation layer. The proposed system uses an embedded system like a Raspberry Pi device and sensors to measure the amount of fire smoke in the air and the proportion of fire in the area. The data obtained from the sensors are sent over the internet to the ThingSpeak platform using the machine-to-machine-based Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for further display and analysis. Data available is then 1) stored, 2) processed, and 3) visualized through the ThingSpeak platform in real-time. An e-mail alert is sent to the farm owner if a fire is detected on the farm using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). When a fire is detected, the anti-fire system is activated. It further filters and analyzes the data using the MATLAB application. Python programming language is also used to develop the program source code. The performance results of the proposed scheme show an accurate fire detection and anti-fire system performance for improving food security and sustainability in agriculture. © 2025 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Emerging diseases, livestock expansion and biodiversity loss are positively related at global scale","Infectious diseases, biodiversity loss and livestock expansion are increasing globally, and examining patterns that link them is important for both public health and conservation. This study is a first attempt to analysis globally these patterns using General additive modelling and Structural equation modelling. A positive association between the number of infectious and parasitic diseases recorded in humans and the total number of animal species between nations was observed. A similar positive association between the number of outbreaks of human infectious diseases, corrected for the number of surveys, and the number of threatened animal species, corrected for the number of animal species, suggests that outbreaks of human infectious diseases are linked with threatened biodiversity. Results of the analyses over the longest period of the dataset (2000–2019) showed a positive correlation between the increasing number of cattle and the number of threatened species, a positive correlation between the increasing number of cattle and the number of outbreaks of human diseases, and a lack of correlation between the number of outbreaks and the number of threatened animal species. As a result, the growing importance of livestock on the planet, while threatening biodiversity, increasingly puts human and animal health at risk. This study calls for further analyses on the consequences of livestock expansion, which depends on several factors that vary by country, namely the growth of human population, changes in diet linked to the westernization of habits, agricultural industrialization and the integration into the world trade, but also the cultural values of livestock. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Farmer perceptions of the vulnerabilities of traditional livestock farming systems under global change,"The continuity of traditional extensive livestock farming is being challenged by rapid socioeconomic and environmental changes, threatening livelihoods and ecosystem services critical to food security and sustainability. We conducted a large-scale assessment involving 255 livestock farmers across six extensive livestock farming systems in Spain to understand their perceptions of vulnerabilities. Using the Coupled Infrastructure Systems framework, we identified 24 different vulnerabilities, mainly caused by external socioeconomic and biophysical disturbances, such as resource costs, low profitability of livestock products, climate variability, and conflicts with wildlife. The main factors explaining these vulnerabilities were primary productivity, farm location, presence of large predators, and climatic conditions. The findings highlight the complex interplay of these factors and provide important insights for the maintenance of extensive livestock farming systems in Europe. This information is crucial for informing policy decisions aimed at supporting these farming systems and ensuring their contribution to food security, sustainability and biodiversity conservation. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
"The role of doctors in communicating climate change: Information, participation, and training","The objective of this article is to examine the role of doctors and health professionals in communicating the health impacts of climate change and exploring how achieving climate objectives is co-beneficial to public health objectives. This article identifies the main interpretative frameworks for climate change communication identified in the literature, contextualizes the challenge of climate communication in the field of public health, and analyses the element of trust, without which the communication process is likely to fail. Awareness-raising strategies must therefore create appropriate contexts that allow the public to perceive climate change as a relevant and immediate issue. Further, to be properly considered, such information must be issued from a source the public trusts. After providing a general framework within which to examine the role of doctors and health professionals in climate communication, message con-tent is examined along with trust in message sources and in the medical profession, and the perceptions among and training of medical professionals concerning the climate challenge are considered. The literature reviewed in this article represents the body of climate change communication research related to the role of the doctor, an area of growing interest. This review provides a timely and complete analysis of the literature on the subject with the goal of starting a necessary, but too-long postponed, multidisciplinary dialogue. © 2021, Inferenze Scarl.

Trade-offs in the provisioning and stability of ecosystem services in agroecosystems,"Changes in land use generate trade-offs in the delivery of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. However, we know little about how the stability of ecosystem services responds to landscape composition, and what ecological mechanisms underlie these trade-offs. Here, we develop a model to investigate the dynamics of three ecosystem services in intensively managed agroecosystems, i.e., pollination-independent crop yield, crop pollination, and biodiversity. Our model reveals trade-offs and synergies imposed by landscape composition that affect not only the magnitude but also the stability of ecosystem service delivery. Trade-offs involving crop pollination are strongly affected by the degree to which crops depend on pollination and by their relative requirement for pollinator densities. We show conditions for crop production to increase with biodiversity and decreasing crop area, reconciling farmers’ profitability and biodiversity conservation. Our results further suggest that, for pollination-dependent crops, management strategies that focus on maximizing yield will often overlook its stability. Given that agriculture has become more pollination-dependent over time, it is essential to understand the mechanisms driving these trade-offs to ensure food security. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America",Not About Sufficiency
Forecasting global spread of invasive pests and pathogens through international trade,"Non-native plant pests and pathogens threaten biodiversity, ecosystem function, food security, and economic livelihoods. As new invasive populations establish, often as an unintended consequence of international trade, they can become additional sources of introductions, accelerating global spread through bridgehead effects. While the study of non-native pest spread has used computational models to provide insights into drivers and dynamics of biological invasions and inform management, efforts have focused on local or regional scales and are challenged by complex transmission networks arising from bridgehead population establishment. This paper presents a flexible spatiotemporal stochastic network model called PoPS (Pest or Pathogen Spread) Global that couples international trade networks with core drivers of biological invasions—climate suitability, host availability, and propagule pressure—quantified through open, globally available databases to forecast the spread of non-native plant pests. The modular design of the framework makes it adaptable for various pests capable of dispersing via human-mediated pathways, supports proactive responses to emerging pests when limited data are available, and enables forecasts at different spatial and temporal resolutions. We demonstrate the framework using a case study of the invasive planthopper spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula). The model was calibrated with historical, known spotted lanternfly introductions to identify potential bridgehead populations that may contribute to global spread. This global view of phytosanitary pandemics provides crucial information for anticipating biological invasions, quantifying transport pathways risk levels, and allocating resources to safeguard plant health, agriculture, and natural resources. © 2023 The Authors.

"Changing climates, changing lives: Voices of a Brazilian Amazon farming community in a time of climate crisis","This study examines the lived experiences and adaptation strategies of small-scale farmers in the southwestern Brazilian Amazonian state of Rondônia, amidst escalating climate challenges. Through nine in-depth interviews, it uncovers the impact of unpredictable weather, increased temperatures, and shifting precipitation on agriculture and livelihoods. Participants, ranging from family farmers to agricultural collective members, detail shifts from traditional crop cultivation to more resilient practices like cattle ranching and dairy production. The narratives reveal a deep understanding of local climate volatility and its direct effects on water availability, crop viability, and livestock productivity. Farmers describe adaptation measures including new crop varieties, irrigation systems, and strategic land use to enhance biodiversity and mitigate climate change effects. Despite these adaptations, challenges like water scarcity, high input costs, and the need for technical assistance remain prominent. Farmers emphasize the need for stronger support systems, highlighting community solidarity, governmental aid, and access to sustainable technologies and education as essential for climate adaptation. They call for policies providing equitable resources and support, underscoring the importance of inclusive climate governance that acknowledges the unique vulnerabilities and contributions of Rondônia’s agricultural sector. This research contributes to understanding how climate change reshapes rural Amazonian communities, arguing that ongoing deforestation and climatic changes threaten regional agricultural stability. It advocates for targeted policy interventions to provide technical assistance for sustainable farming and climate adaptation, alongside mechanisms to support fair market pricing. These measures are essential for enhancing the resilience and sustainability of local farming communities amidst climate change. © 2024 Monteverde et al.

Disaggregating the value of conservation agriculture to inform smallholder transition to sustainable farming: A mexican case study,"Conservation Agriculture (CA) is promoted by research and development (R&D) agencies to sustainably intensify agricultural systems with the goals of improving food security and livelihoods and adapting food systems to global climate change. Despite the many benefits of CA, there are few farmers around the world that have simultaneously implemented all facets of the strategy. In part, this reflects the challenges in applying, adapting, and understanding this complex and multi-dimensional agricultural innovation in the context of diverse farming systems. In this paper, we applied an integrated framework that combines bioeconomic simulation, risk analysis, adoption theory, and impact assessment to investigate how various combinations of CA components (no-tillage, soil cover, crop diversification, plus growing a new crop or variety) performed over a 10-year period in representative farms in a central Mexican case study. We found significant differences in profit, net value, downside risk, and risk-aversion cost between double-component scenarios (and improved CA to a lesser extent) and all other scenarios, which suggested that disaggregating CA into smaller component packages could increase farmer adoption in risky contexts. Our findings provided valuable insights on CA feasibility and could help establish policy and reporting metrics. The study highlighted the need for employing a range of research tools to understand the relative value of agricultural innovations and to identify and reduce trade-offs and uncertainty in farming systems. © 2021 by the authors.

The Mitigation Mechanisms of Climate Change in The South African Context,"South African climate change is unique and takes three forms: excessive heat, floods and sporadic wildfires. Climate change is not only affecting human beings; it is a challenge across the board. The challenges apply to nature, the environment and any creature in the universe. However, the main role player in managing this appropriately remains human beings. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the mitigating mechanisms of climate change in South Africa. From the non-empirical research design, i.e. a systematic review standpoint, the researchers analysed historical overview patterns of rainfall, droughts, floods and heatwaves in the South African context. For data collection, documentary sources were used qualitatively. Non-probability purposive sampling was adopted to outline keywords/phrases to filter information relevant to the study purposes and the research problem, restricted to 10 years in the literature. Textual analysis was adopted for data analysis. It was established that the climate condition challenges manifest differently in the nine South African provinces. Each of these provinces experiences different types of climate change challenges. South Africa has two main economic challenges related to climate based on water shortages and the electricity crisis. The results also show that South Africa sources electricity from Mozambique and water from Lesotho and human beings are liable for the proper control and sustainable mitigation mechanisms of these scarce basic needs. They do not conserve the environment properly, further affecting other creatures negatively. Their actions are very toxic to this environment, creating other severe challenges to climate change. This paper recommends mitigation processes to overcome climate change challenges in South Africa by harvesting energy and water. This will turn South African climate change challenges into viable economic growth opportunities by using the two main challenges of floods and excessive heat in a beneficial way. © Authour(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Urbanization and smart cities,"The shift from rural to urban societies and predominantly urban culture is a global trend with significant consequences for environment quality. Chapter 7, “Urbanization and Smart Cities,” focuses on the challenges of global urbanization by recognizing the potential of integrating physical, social, ecological, and technological infrastructures. Climate change and social inequality are the present-day calamities and part of the sustainable development goals to be addressed while redefining the 21st century city as an agent of resilient change. The essential links between environmental systems, sustainability, public space, social justice, and information and communications technology (ICT) need to be reinforced through urban design and planning of our cities. In this chapter, innovative solutions from across the globe reflecting efficiency and flexibility in urban services have been discussed as examples of ICT-information and communications technology related initiatives for improving the quality of life index of our cities. Across multiple dimensions, the scale and speed of urbanization is unprecedented, and especially so in developing regions. Today, in Asia, the urban agglomerations and anticipated growth in urban population will require one of the most massive build-up of urban infrastructure. Since there is much to learn from countries with the fastest rate of urbanization, paradigms and cases from India have been cited for impacting urban policies in cities all over the world. As agglomerations of population and services increase, cities need to acknowledge their potential vulnerability to the impacts of mass migration and natural hazards, mainly due to our growing energy and resource consumption. One of the recommendations for successfully implementing innovative concepts is that based on diverse perspectives and multidisciplinary dialog the “smart cities” initiative must support programmatic interventions as well as facilitate community partnerships and citizen participation. The focus of smart cities needs to remain on the sustainable and equitable use of a city’s resources—natural, human, and financial. The conclusion is that our cities are a joint built and natural environment, which requires a design-driven, integrative, and systems-based approach, one grounded in a deep understanding of social life, political context, ecological transformation, and spatial thinking. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Next-gen agriculture: integrating AI and XAI for precision crop yield predictions,"Climate change poses significant challenges to global food security by altering precipitation patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts, heatwaves, and floods. These phenomena directly affect agricultural productivity, leading to lower crop yields and economic losses for farmers. This study leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to predict crop yields and assess the impacts of climate change on agriculture, providing a novel approach to understanding complex interactions between climatic and agronomic factors. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the study identifies temperature as the most critical factor influencing crop yields, with notable interactions observed between rainfall patterns and macronutrient levels. Advanced regression models, including Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and LightGBM Regressor, achieved exceptional predictive performance, with R² scores reaching 0.92, mean squared errors as low as 0.02, and mean absolute errors of 0.015. Additionally, XAI techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) enhanced the interpretability of the predictions, offering actionable insights into the relative importance of key features. These insights inform strategies for agricultural decision-making and climate adaptation. By integrating AI-driven predictions with XAI-based interpretability, this research presents a robust and transparent framework for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture, emphasizing its potential for scalable application in precision farming and policy development.

Data4Good: An Established Framework for supporting Civil Society Organizations,"Civil society organisations (CSOs) are critical to the advancement of human well-being, particularly in the Global South and in Small Island Developing States (SIDS). In these developing spaces, civil society's impact often faces barriers due to resource constraints ranging from human capacity to finance. It is well established that data science and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) play a key role in the digital age in improving the efficiency and productivity of for-profit companies. However, such benefits have yet to be accrued in the work of civil society in small developing states as they often lack the resources to use tools like Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve their operations. Simply providing funding or ICT resources may not solve the problem. We propose a framework in which Data Science resources can be provided to CSOs in such a way that all parties benefit, through an adaptation of the technology stewardship model. The proposed model describes a distributed framework for technology stewardship that comprises a coordinating agency, client and beneficiary civil society organisations, students and expert mentors, that all work together to deliver value to the beneficiary organisations, as well as to each other. This Framework has been trialled with 10 beneficiary civil society organisations in Trinidad and Tobago with exceptional results. We provide details of this framework as well as the outcomes of its first deployment. © 2022 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the impacts of agricultural drought (SPI/SPEI) on maize and wheat yields across Hungary,"This study examined the physical properties of agricultural drought (i.e., intensity, duration, and severity) in Hungary from 1961 to 2010 based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The study analyzed the interaction between drought and crop yield for maize and wheat using standardized yield residual series (SYRS), and the crop-drought resilient factor (CDRF). The results of both SPI and SPEI (-3, -6) showed that the western part of Hungary has significantly more prone to agricultural drought than the eastern part of the country. Drought frequency analysis reveals that the eastern, northern, and central parts of Hungary were the most affected regions. Drought analysis also showed that drought was particularly severe in Hungary during 1970–1973, 1990–1995, 2000–2003, and 2007. The yield of maize was more adversely affected than wheat especially in the western and southern regions of Hungary (1961–2010). In general, maize and wheat yields were severely non-resilient (CDRF < 0.8) in the central and western part of the country. The results suggest that drought events are a threat to the attainment of the second Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-2). Therefore, to ensure food security in Hungary and in other parts of the world, drought resistant crop varieties need to be developed to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on agricultural production. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
A socio-ecological framework examination of drivers of blood pressure control among patients with comorbidities and on treatment in two Nairobi slums; a qualitative study,"Despite the known and effective treatments to control blood pressure, there is limited information on why there are high uncontrolled hypertension rates in urban slum settings. The aim of this paper is to explore the views of treated people with uncontrolled hypertension and other key stakeholders on the facilitators and barriers to blood pressure control among people with comorbid conditions in two Nairobi slums. The study was conducted in two Nairobi slums namely, Korogocho and Viwandani. This study used a qualitative methodology using interviews and focus group discussions. Barriers and facilitators to blood pressure control were explored using the Social Ecological Model (SEM) framework. A total of 57 participants were interviewed for this study. There were 31 in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions among participants with uncontrolled hypertension and with comorbidities. Additionally, 16 key informant interviews were conducted with healthcare providers and decision/policymakers. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. This study identified barriers and facilitators to blood pressure control among patients with uncontrolled hypertension at the patient/individual level, family and community level, health system level and at the policy level. High cost of hypertension medicines, the constant unavailability of medicines at the health facilities, unsupportive family and environment, poor medicines supply chain management, availability and use of guidelines were among the barriers reported. The results show that uncontrolled hypertension is a major public health issue in slums of Nairobi and they highlight barriers to blood pressure control at different levels of the socio-ecological model. These findings can be used to design holistic interventions to improve blood pressure control by addressing factors operating at multiple levels of the socio-ecological framework. © 2023 Mohamed et al.

Sustainable Urbanism: Pathway to Resilient Strategies in Adapting Early Malay Town towards Low Carbon City,"Due to an alarming rate on the impact of global climate change, the integration of low-carbon goal in regeneration of historic urban areas is regarded as a key part towards the implementation of sustainable urbanism practises based on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Much studies on the planning and design of low carbon strategies concerned overwhelmingly on the new planned cities without much emphasis given on the implemented at old town centre. In the context of Malay early town, the adaptation of the low carbon planning as shifting in environmental conditions is regarded as paramount importance particularly in the planning of the urban form to address the growing complexity of urban fabric at the town. This paper therefore explores the developed framework of Low Carbon City initiative and integration of resilience as an approach in urban transformation and regeneration of Malay early town to provide the platform for understanding the complexity of urban-natural environment from morphological perspective. The purpose of this research is two-fold; firstly, to examine the role of discourse in implementing Low Carbon City Framework (LCCF) in Malaysia at large. The second objective is to identify the place-specific mechanisms based on resilience approach to understand the capacity of urban form system to absorb, adapt or transform in ensuring the dynamic equilibrium of the urban-natural system. Considering Kota Bharu as representative of Malay town, a discursive-analytical perspective framed to examine the upsurge of the LCCF that helps to understand the pathway towards integration of framework at national, state and district level. Such comprehension on implementation measure formed a basis to identify the interactions between environmental performance and urban forms pattern as strategies for resilience. A case study with mapping analysis were employed that revealed significant relations between socio-cultural and environmental dimension which shaped the formation and transformation of urban morphology of the town. This study concludes with an examination of possible future directions for integration of space-morphological approach to general urban resilience for future adaptation planning of Malay towns towards Low Carbon City. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Global challenges in water, sanitation and health","The year 2005 marks the beginning of the ""International Decade for Action: Water for Life"" and renewed effort to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce by half the proportion of the world's population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation by 2015. Currently, UNICEF and WHO estimate that 1.1 billion people lack access to improved water supplies and 2.6 billion people lack adequate sanitation. Providing safe water and basic sanitation to meet the MDGs will require substantial economic resources, sustainable technological solutions and courageous political will. We review five major challenges to providing safe water and sanitation on a global basis: (1) contamination of water in distribution systems, (2) growing water scarcity and the potential for water reuse and conservation, (3) implementing innovative low-cost sanitation systems, (4) Providing sustainable water supplies and sanitation for megacities, and (5) reducing global and regional disparities in access to water and sanitation and developing financially sustainable water and sanitation services. © IWA Publishing 2006.",Not About Sufficiency
"Spatial evaluation of surface water irrigation potential areas to improve rural crop productivity in the Gomma district, southwestern Ethiopia","The cycle of food insecurity caused by poor water management practices poses major concerns for the sustainability of living balance in Southwestern Ethiopia’s smallholder agricultural areas. The prior study looked at crop land suitability assessments. However, there are still knowledge gaps on irrigation infrastructure sites. As a result, this research was launched to evaluate the surface water irrigation (SWI) potential of river watersheds in the Gomma area, southwestern Ethiopia. To identify possible SWI, biophysical parameters such as topography, stream order, soil texture, land use-land cover, drainage density, and climate elements were analyzed. Potential SWI sites were identified using multiple-criteria decision-making analysis from the sources of information reviewed, which were applied for selecting suitable sites. A comparison matrix, weighted analysis, Boolean-operations, and survey approaches. The analysis findings reveal that about 16% of the Gomma is highly suitable (S1) for drip or sprinkler surface water irrigation (SWI) schemes, while 7% and 77% of the total fall under the categories of moderate and unsuitable for SWI, respectively. At the catchment level, the most irrigable catchments in Didessa, Naso, Awetu, Tamsa, and Urgessa were found to be approximately 1838, 1626, 1484, 1107, and 910 ha of total area, respectively. In contrast to prior outcomes, the eventual eligibility map of foreseeable SWI zones are squarely distributed over the study region. In conclusion, to optimize the impact on agricultural productivity and water resource management, it is advised to prioritize the implementation of drip or sprinkler surface water irrigation (SWI) schemes in areas identified as highly suitable. © 2024 The Author(s).

Drip irrigation as a socio-technical configuration: policy design and technological choice in Western India,"Through a case study of farmers in India we examine the relationship between drip irrigation subsidy policies, farmer adoption and technological choice. We examine changes in the subsidy design and the implications that these have for farmers. We show how the negotiation of multiple interests influences the kind of technology promoted and the design of the subsidy programme. This creates barriers to adoption, particularly for relatively resource-poor farmers.

"A bibliometric analysis of sustainable development goals (SDGs): a review of progress, challenges, and opportunities","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a global appeal to protect the environment, combat climate change, eradicate poverty, and ensure access to a high quality of life and prosperity for all. The next decade is crucial for determining the planet’s direction in ensuring that populations can adapt to climate change. This study aims to investigate the progress, challenges, opportunities, trends, and prospects of the SDGs through a bibliometric analysis from 2015 to 2022, providing insight into the evolution and maturity of scientific research in the field. The Web of Science core collection citation database was used for the bibliometric analysis, which was conducted using VOSviewer and RStudio. We analyzed 12,176 articles written in English to evaluate the present state of progress, as well as the challenges and opportunities surrounding the SDGs. This study utilized a variety of methods to identify research hotspots, including analysis of keywords, productive researchers, and journals. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive literature review by utilizing the Web of Science database. The results show that 31% of SDG-related research productivity originates from the USA, China, and the UK, with an average citation per article of 15.06. A total of 45,345 authors around the world have contributed to the field of SDGs, and collaboration among authors is also quite high. The core research topics include SDGs, climate change, Agenda 2030, the circular economy, poverty, global health, governance, food security, sub-Saharan Africa, the Millennium Development Goals, universal health coverage, indicators, gender, and inequality. The insights gained from this analysis will be valuable for young researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and public officials as they seek to identify patterns and high-quality articles related to SDGs. By advancing our understanding of the subject, this research has the potential to inform and guide future efforts to promote sustainable development. The findings indicate a concentration of research and development on SDGs in developed countries rather than in developing and underdeveloped countries.

Gender Gap in Food Security and Nutrition: Special Case of India in the G20,"The sustainability of food security and adequate nutrition is a global challenge. The G20 nations, representing two-thirds of the global population bear half of the world’s malnutrition burden in the form of either excessive or inadequate intake of nutrition. The general risks associated with food insecurity in terms of climate change, ecology and resource contraction vis-à-vis population are macro issues involving the global commons. This article which relates to the micro issue of the gender gap in household food security is based on public data and international indices on the status of food security and the gender gap. The study indicates the presence of a gender gap in nutrition for reasons more socio-cultural, than economic. The study is focused on G20 nations, especially India as it bears the largest burden of nutrition-related disease within the G20. Data from the Global Hunger Index and the Global Gender Gap Index of 2022 has portrayed India as a dismal performer despite the fact that India runs the largest public food security programme that has targeted nutrition programs for women beneficiaries. The present article identifies the common challenges faced by the G20 nations in the realm of food security and the steps taken for mitigation. The article also examines cooperation within G20 in realising the Sustainable Development Goals related to ending hunger and realising gender equity in food. © 2023 Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA).",Not About Sufficiency
The major integration features of banking system,"The internationalization of the banking sector in developing countries brings both significant benefits and challenges.Foreign banks promote competition, efficiency and financial inclusion, which accelerates the integration of local banking systems into the global economy.However, the arrival of large international players may increase risks and force local banks to make significant changes.Studies show that the influence of foreign banks is ambiguous and depends on the level of economic development of the country.When assessing the effects of globalization, it is important to consider the differences between developed and developing countries.In periods of economic crisis, foreign banks can play a stabilizing role, but they can also import shocks from their own countries.To maximize benefits and minimize risks, it is necessary to develop a strategy that ensures a balanced presence of foreign banks, supports competition and innovation, but does not allow excessive concentration of bank capital.In this context, the internationalization of financial services becomes an important tool for strengthening and liberalizing the financial systems of developing countries, opening new opportunities for their economic growth and sustainable development.Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the beginning of the era of financial liberalization, one of the most important manifestations of the process of integration of the banking sector into the world economy has been the expansion of foreign banking capital into foreign markets.Financial sector liberalization is intended to provide equal opportunities for financial institutions to access the international market or reduce restrictions from local regulators.Liberalization of the banking industry is one of the most important financial sector liberalization programs. © The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Place-Based Solutions for Net Zero: Gender Considerations on 'Green' Skills,"There is a global effort towards transitioning to a zero or low-carbon economy due to climate change and the current energy crises. This requires a shift in socio-technical systems and cross collaboration amidst sectors. The move to a clean energy-based economy also involves the creation of a broad range of skills, the upskilling and reskilling of the existing workforce, and providing opportunities for training. While many critical analyses of emerging decarbonisation or green skills, focus on issues of clean energy transition and the distribution of opportunities between fossil fuel-based and clean energy industries, there is limited critical analysis of justice and equality regarding the distribution of opportunities for developing key green skills for place-based decarbonisation. There is evidence of asymmetric power relations and gender inequalities regarding the acquisition of skills, employment opportunities, kinds of jobs and pay gap which disproportionately affect women. This paper presents compelling evidence of hegemonic masculinisation within the energy industry; this tendency is now mirrored in ecological industries and technologies, including within the renewable energy sector, leading to an 'eco-masculinisation' of the sector. Just transition principles promote a fair distribution of resources and the representation of vulnerable groups, including women and minorities. By relying on local assets and resources, including human resources, place-based approaches to green skills could address local communities' needs while strengthening their resilience. These processes are pivotal to a fair and equitable transition. By explicitly articulating the context of place in understanding the gender(ed) dynamics of decarbonisation and skills, the authors identify and reflect on an innovative way of understanding the intersections between infrastructures, skills, and masculinisation in the transition to low zero carbon. © 2023 Proceedings of the International Conference on Gender Research.

"Spatial-Temporal Patterns of Ecosystem Services Supply-Demand and Influencing Factors: A Case Study of Resource-Based Cities in the Yellow River Basin, China","The aim of this study was to reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs), as well as the significant driving factors for understanding the impact of human activities on the natural ecosystem. To provide a scientific basis for formulating regional sustainable development strategies that enhance human well-being, resource-based cities in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) were selected as the case study. The supply and demand of ecosystem services in these cities from 2000 to 2020 were measured. The spatiotemporal evolution of the supply-demand relationship was illustrated by taking its coordination degree. In addition, geographical detector and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were applied to quantify the spatiotemporally varying effects of natural and socioeconomic factors on the ES supply--demand relationship. The results showed that resource-based cities in the YRB were experiencing expansion in supply and demand overall, but the supply-demand relationship tended to be tense. The northwest YRB had higher coordination values of supply-demand, while lower values were found in the southeast YRB. Moreover, the relationship between supply and demand was significantly affected by natural and socioeconomic factors, such as elevation, slope, precipitation, land-use type, population density, and gross domestic product (GDP) per land. Furthermore, the GWR model suggested that the effects of driving factors on the supply-demand relationship had notable spatial heterogeneity. The coordination of ES supply-demand in the resource-based cities of southeast YRB was mainly influenced by socioeconomic factors, while that of the west YRB was mainly influenced by natural factors. Our study suggested that it is necessary to enhance the awareness of environmental protection, pay attention to ecological restoration, and avoid unreasonable human disturbance to the ecosystem. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
A Review of Policies and Legislations of Vehicular Exhaust Emissions in Ghana and Their Enforcement,"Globally, the transportation sector is expanding at a fast pace in tandem with urban and socioeconomic development, contributing significantly to severe air pollution. Due to concerns about air quality, human exposure, public health, and climate change, air pollution has garnered considerable attention. Most people in the country are unaware of the policy and legislation on vehicular exhaust emissions, so vehicular air pollution and its consequences have received little attention. Although the majority of rich countries have implemented automobile emission control measures, developing countries such as Ghana continue to use extremely crude methods. Based on available research, this study summarizes global policies and regulations that have been used to regulate vehicular exhaust emissions from high-emitting automobiles. The purpose of this research is to assist a broader audience in comprehending Ghana's overall system for preventing and controlling motor vehicle-related air pollution by providing an overview of pertinent legislation, policies, and enforcement, as no such review has been presented in the country. Policymakers will benefit from the insights and lessons offered in this study to develop robust air quality control legislative packages in Ghana. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency

Invisible Hand or Ecological Footprint? Comparing Social Versus Environmental Impacts of Recent Economic Growth,"This study examines changes in some key indicators among 66 countries on six continents over a 56-year period, to compare the power of economic growth to improve human health and income distribution with its tendency to degrade the natural environment. The results indicate that growth depletes and pollutes nature far more than it benefits society. This suggests that public policy should shift toward enhancement of individual and social well-being in ways more direct and effective, and less ecologically damaging, than reliance on overall growth in gross domestic product. I illustrate this implication with a degrowth scenario for the United States to 2050 that draws on the empirical results for the period 1961 to 2016. And I consider certain reforms in the management and governance of organizations to implement such a scenario. © The Author(s) 2019.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating Digitalization and Sustainability: An Innovative Approach to Assess Digitainability in Manufacturing,"Manufacturing faces significant sustainability challenges due to its intensive consumption of natural resources. The paradigm of sustainable manufacturing stood out in recent years, prompting the development of various tools and methodologies to assess the sustainability performance of manufacturing activities. These tools often evaluate environmental, economic, and social impacts based on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework. However, their practical application remains limited due to scalability issues (with few tools addressing entire manufacturing systems), sector-specific designs, and challenges in the comparability of results. The adoption of the Best Available Techniques (BAT) framework has also set new benchmarks for assessing sustainability performance. In the context of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, there is a growing need to rethink sustainability assessment as a tool that not only guides the digitalization process but also ensures that sustainable practices are integrated effectively. This paper introduces the concept of “digitainability”, representing the convergence of sustainability and digital transformation, shaping future manufacturing paradigms. The DigiSustain Manufacturing Assessment Model (DSMAM) provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating sustainability performance by addressing both the environmental impacts and the digital transformation of manufacturing systems. The model focuses on reducing resource consumption and enhancing operational efficiency through digital innovation, offering strategies for redesigning and reengineering manufacturing processes. It also offers insights for redesigning and reengineering manufacturing processes, identifying opportunities for sustainable digital advancements that drive the development of the factory of the future. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Conservation agriculture and climate resilience,"Agricultural productivity growth is vital for economic and food security outcomes which are threatened by climate change. In response, governments and development agencies are encouraging the adoption of ‘climate-smart’ agricultural technologies, such as conservation agriculture (CA). However, there is little rigorous evidence that demonstrates the effect of CA on production or climate resilience, and what evidence exists is hampered by selection bias. Using panel data from Zimbabwe, we test how CA performs during extreme rainfall events - both shortfalls and surpluses. We control for the endogenous adoption decision and find that use of CA in years of average rainfall results in no yield gains, and in some cases yield loses. However, CA is effective in mitigating the negative impacts of deviations in rainfall. We conclude that the lower yields during normal rainfall seasons may be a proximate factor in low uptake of CA. Policy should focus promotion of CA on these climate resilience benefits. © 2018 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, and Deep Learning for Sustainable Precision Agriculture","Agriculture is undergoing a digital transformation because of population growth, climate change, and food security concerns. Agriculture is influenced by information technology in terms of cost reduction, efficiency, and sustainability. Precision agriculture employs IoT, deep learning, predictive analytics, and AI-based technologies to aid in the detection of plant diseases, pests, and poor plant nutrition in the field. The study's objectives are as follows: 1) evaluate the role of smart technologies and their impact on precision agriculture sustainability; 2) assess the typical application of IoT data analytics and deep learning in precision agriculture; and 3) investigate the barriers to the adoption of sustainable precision farming. IoT technologies collect data and relay it to data analytics and deep learning for in-depth analysis. The findings indicate that data assists farmers in managing crop variety, phenotypes and selection, crop performance, soil quality, pH level, irrigation, and fertilizer application quantity. The study looks at typical application areas and critical success factors for precision agriculture. Technological issues, safety, privacy, cost, and legal issues influence the adoption of these technologies. Individual farmers, government, academics, and agricultural authorities will all benefit from the research. The study recommends the adoption and optimization of innovations and technologies e.g. mobile devices, access to better internet speed, low-cost and dependable satellites for positioning and imagery, and precision agriculture-optimized agricultural machinery. Future research should focus on the application of appropriate decision-support systems for implementing precision decisions. © 2022 IST-Africa Institute and Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable urban development: The impact of an asphalt plant on the quality of atmospheric air,"The development of industry, the use of various chemicals in technological processes, the large emissions of industrial enterprises, the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in agriculture have caused environmental pollution with harmful substances. Environmental protection is now becoming one of the economic problems and is an extremely urgent task of humanity. The purpose of this article is to present the main results of the study and analysis of atmospheric air pollution by the asphalt plant, which is located almost in the center of Yekaterinburg; to investigate the compliance of the existing hazard class of the enterprise, which increases its production volumes, to correct the size and location of the sanitary protection zone of the plant, taking into account the wind rose, and to try to propose a number of measures to reduce the negative impact of the plants in this industry. In considering the impact of anthropogenic activities on nature, attention should be paid to the concept of sustainable development, which carries principles based on the satisfaction of human needs, with a focus on caring for the well-being of future generations. If we consider the issue from the perspective of this concept, then the asphalt plant, in order to prevent possible environmental damage, should invest material and money to further minimize the amount of pollutants. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
Ten facts about land systems for sustainability,"Land use is central to addressing sustainability issues, including biodiversity conservation, climate change, food security, poverty alleviation, and sustainable energy. In this paper, we synthesize knowledge accumulated in land system science, the integrated study of terrestrial social-ecological systems, into 10 hard truths that have strong, general, empirical support. These facts help to explain the challenges of achieving sustainability in land use and thus also point toward solutions. The 10 facts are as follows: 1) Meanings and values of land are socially constructed and contested; 2) land systems exhibit complex behaviors with abrupt, hard-to-predict changes; 3) irreversible changes and path dependence are common features of land systems; 4) some land uses have a small footprint but very large impacts; 5) drivers and impacts of land-use change are globally interconnected and spill over to distant locations; 6) humanity lives on a used planet where all land provides benefits to societies; 7) land-use change usually entails trade-offs between different benefits—""win–wins"" are thus rare; 8) land tenure and land-use claims are often unclear, overlapping, and contested; 9) the benefits and burdens from land are unequally distributed; and 10) land users have multiple, sometimes conflicting, ideas of what social and environmental justice entails. The facts have implications for governance, but do not provide fixed answers. Instead they constitute a set of core principles which can guide scientists, policy makers, and practitioners toward meeting sustainability challenges in land use. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

"Spatial, socio-economic, and ecological implications of incorporating minimum size constraints in marine protected area network design","Marine protected areas (MPAs) are the cornerstone of most marine conservation strategies, but the effectiveness of each one partly depends on its size and distance to other MPAs in a network. Despite this, current recommendations on ideal MPA size and spacing vary widely, and data are lacking on how these constraints might influence the overall spatial characteristics, socio-economic impacts, and connectivity of the resultant MPA networks. To address this problem, we tested the impact of applying different MPA size constraints in English waters. We used the Marxan spatial prioritization software to identify a network of MPAs that met conservation feature targets, whilst minimizing impacts on fisheries; modified the Marxan outputs with the MinPatch software to ensure each MPA met a minimum size; and used existing data on the dispersal distances of a range of species found in English waters to investigate the likely impacts of such spatial constraints on the region's biodiversity. Increasing MPA size had little effect on total network area or the location of priority areas, but as MPA size increased, fishing opportunity cost to stakeholders increased. In addition, as MPA size increased, the number of closely connected sets of MPAs in networks and the average distance between neighboring MPAs decreased, which consequently increased the proportion of the planning region that was isolated from all MPAs. These results suggest networks containing large MPAs would be more viable for the majority of the region's species that have small dispersal distances, but dispersal between MPA sets and spill-over of individuals into unprotected areas would be reduced. These findings highlight the importance of testing the impact of applying different MPA size constraints because there are clear trade-offs that result from the interaction of size, number, and distribution of MPAs in a network. © 2015, Society for Conservation Biology.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of Hg pollution in stream waters and human health risk in areas impacted by mining activities in the Ecuadorian Amazon,"Illegal gold mining activities have contributed to the release and mobilization of Hg and environmental degradation in many parts of the world. This study aims to determine the concentration of Hg in five provinces of the Amazon Region of Ecuador, in addition to assessing the risk to human health of exposed populations, applying deterministic and probabilistic methods. For this purpose, 147 water samples were collected in rivers and streams crossing and/or located near mining areas. As a result, 100% of the samples analyzed exceeded the maximum permissible limit (MPL) according to the water quality criteria for the preservation of aquatic life of the Ecuadorian regulations, while 7% of the samples exceeded the MPL for drinking water. On the other hand, considering the European Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) for surface water bodies, in our study, 100% of the samples exceed the maximum permissible limit (0.07 µg/L), and with respect to the Canadian water quality guidelines, 35% of the samples exceed the permissible limit (0.001 mg/l) for drinking water, and 100% of the samples exceed the limit for life in water bodies (0.0001 mg/l). The risk assessment revealed that the probability of developing adverse health effects from exposure to Hg is below the recommended limits according to the probabilistic assessment; this is in relation to the criterion of residential and recreational use of water resources. However, it was identified that the child population doubles the acceptable systemic risk level according to the results of the deterministic assessment in the residential scenario. This information can be used by decision-makers to implement strategies to reduce Hg contamination and exposure of the population in Ecuadorian Amazonian rivers. © 2023, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Modeling high-resolution climate change impacts on wheat and maize in Italy,"The Mediterranean basin has been identified as a prominent hotspot of climate change, with expected negative impacts on crop productivity, among others. Given the primary role that agriculture has to sustain cultural values, economic opportunities, and food security, it is crucial to identify specific risks in agriculture due to climate change, which can address more effective adaptation strategies and policies to cope with climate change. This study aims to evaluate the high-resolution impacts of climate change on the length of the growing cycle and yield of durum wheat, common wheat, and maize in Italy by using the CERES-Wheat and CERES-Maize crop models implemented in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) software. A digital platform (GIS-DSSAT) was developed to couple crop simulation models with dynamically downscaled climate projections at high resolution for Italy, which can better represent the Italian landscape complexity and the spatial distribution of different pedological and crop management features, providing more detailed information on the expected impacts on crops respect to previous studies at a coarser resolution. The projections have been extended for two climate change scenarios and accounting for uncertainty, either considering or not the potential direct effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]). Results show that climate change may affect Italian cereal production in the medium to long term periods. Maize is the main affected crop, with yield reductions homogeneously distributed from North to South Italy. Wheat yield is expected to decrease mainly in southern Italy, while northern Italy may benefit from higher precipitation regimes. Higher levels of atmospheric CO2 concentrations may partially offset the negative impact posed by climate change and increase the benefits in the northern regions, especially for common and durum wheat. © 2021 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Does Temperature Contribute to Environment Degradation? Pakistani Experience Based on Nonlinear Bounds Testing Approach,"Many developing countries are acutely vulnerable to global climate changes. In Pakistan, carbon emissions are primarily contributed by the factor of energy production from oil, gas and coal. The objective of this study is to estimate the asymmetric impact of temperature, energy use, economic growth, water scarcity on CO2 emissions in Pakistan over their period of 1960–2016. Based on nonlinear bounds testing (NARDL) approach, it is confirmed that there is an asymmetric relationship between temperature and CO2 emission, while energy use, population growth and economic growth have a positive effect in the short run. In the long run, energy consumption and economic growth were found to increase emission, while a temperature decrease by 1 per cent leads to 5 per cent decrease in carbon emissions. Population and water availability also reduces emission in Pakistan. Further, the study also confirms the long-run relationship between the variables. The finding of the study noticeably supports the policy to increase renewable energy consumption. © 2020 IMI.",Not About Sufficiency
Effects of artisanal gold mining and routes towards sustainable development for a low-profile mining community in Ghana,"The objective of the study is to examine the effects of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) and routes towards sustainable development (SD) for a low-profile mining community in Ghana. The study drew on the literature on mining, sustainable development, and the Natural Resource Curse (NRC) theory. Data were gathered using semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with 203 participants selected through the purposive and snowball sampling methods. The data were analysed using the thematic approach. The findings indicate that although ASGM supported livelihoods through employment and income generation, it had numerous negative effects that weakened the ‘pillars’ of SD, namely social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Among others, the study reveals conflicts, drop-out and absenteeism among students andpupils, drug abuse, teenage pregnancies, child labour, and violence in the host community. Economically, ASGM affected agricultural production and food security following the destruction of farms and farmlands, while labour and capital were moved from farming to mining. Environmentally, air and water bodies were polluted, flora and fauna destroyed, and productive lands degraded. In short, the SD costs were perceived to be greater than the benefits, lending credence to the NRC theory. Several of these adverse effects were due to the fact that the activities were neither formalized nor regulated. Besides, the operations were characterized by inappropriate technology and lack of geological data, leading to unsustainable mining practices resulting in anti-development outcomes. By way of routes towards sustainability, it is recommended that the operations be formalized under the existing Community Mining Scheme and regulated to ensure responsible, accountable, and sustainable mining. The Scheme should be strengthened in order to drive positive impact-making mining operations by means of introducing a sustainability-oriented licensing regime, sustainable mining technologies, access to land and geological data, stakeholder participation, capacity building on sustainable mining literacy, and eco-friendly mine closure strategies. © 2024 United Nations.",Not About Sufficiency
Modeling current and future groundwater demands in the White Volta River Basin of Ghana under climate change and socio-economic scenarios,"Study region: White Volta River Basin, Ghana. Study focus: Groundwater sustainability is becoming a major concern in the face of population growth, land use land cover (LULC), and climate changes. The Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model is used in this study to analyse the current and future groundwater demands for the period of 2015–2070. Two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5) scenarios from statistically downscaled fifteen CMIP5 models were combined three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs 2,3 and 5) scenarios in the nine sub-catchments of the White Volta River Basin. New hydrological insights for the study region: The WEAP model was calibrated (2006–2012) and validated (2013–2020) using streamflow data from six gauges in five sub-catchments. The findings show that climatic change and socio-economic development will result in a disparity between groundwater supply and demand in sub-catchments with greater socioeconomic growth, especially those with higher population density and arable agricultural land. Among the basin's nine sub-catchments, four will experience water scarcity under all future scenarios. While the groundwater flow and recharge data may be evaluated using several physical hydrological models, the calibration and validation results suggest that the current modeling approach is capable of reliably predicting future groundwater demand with associated uncertainties. The study establishes a link between climate change, socio-economic growth, and groundwater availability in the White Volta River Basin. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of ecological sustainability of a building subjected to potential seismic events during its lifetime,"Purpose: Sustainable development aims to enhance the quality of life by improving the social, economic and environmental conditions for present and future generations. A sustainable engineering decision-making strategy for design and assessment of construction works (i.e., civil engineering and buildings) should take into account considerations regarding the society, the economy and the environment. This study presents a novel approach for the life cycle assessment (LCA) of a case-study building subjected to seismic actions during its service life, accounting for structural reliability. Methods: A methodology is presented that evaluates the time-dependent probability of exceeding a limit state considering the uncertainty in the representation of seismic action. By employing this methodology, the earthquake-induced damages are related to the environmental and social losses caused by the occurrence of the earthquake. A LCA of a case-study building accounting for the time-dependent seismic reliability is conducted using a damage-oriented LCA approach. Results and discussion: The contributions of the different life cycle phases to the total environmental impact related to the building lifetime are in agreement with previous results in this field of study. However, the LCA results revealed significant risk-based contributions for the rehabilitation phase due to the induced damage resulting in seismic events. Particularly, the rehabilitation phase is expected to contribute to the total environmental impact with around the 25 % of the initial environmental impact load (related to the pre-use phase) as a consequence of seismic damage. Conclusions and recommendations: The probability of occurrence of seismic events affects the LCA results for various life cycle phases of a building in terms of all the indicators adopted in the analysis. The time-dependent probability of collapse in a year can represent a benchmark indicator for human safety in the context of social sustainability for the building sector. The proposed approach can be implemented in a sustainable decision-making tool for design and assessment. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Not About Sufficiency
A multi-objective optimization approach for harnessing rainwater in changing climate,"As the world grapples with the profound impacts of climate change, water scarcity has become a pressing issue. However, there is a shortage of in-depth research on the trade-offs between water resource dependence and the economic, ecological, and social needs of arid and semi-arid regions like Lanzhou, China. Flower cultivation in Lanzhou relies heavily on the Yellow River, often overlooking the potential of natural rainfall. Here we first calibrated a water balance model through artificial precipitation experiments in a Soil and Water Conservation Demonstration Park in Lanzhou. We then developed a multi-objective optimization model to balance the cost-benefit considerations of various plausible measures across economic, ecological, and social dimensions in the searching for solutions that are more adaptable to climate change and local development needs. Model simulations show that the solutions we designed can effectively manage water-shortage days, significantly reduce Yellow River water extraction, and improve cost-effectiveness, meeting 66%–80% of water needs for flower cultivation in the studied park. The findings highlight the potential of rainwater collection and utilization solutions to mitigate water scarcity in arid and semi-arid cities, thereby enriching water resource management. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Research on the influence of energy utilization and economic development on human well-being in Qinghai-Tibet plateau,"Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a typical resource-rich but economically backward region in west-ern China, and it is of great urgency to improve human well-being. Combined with previous scholars’ research and the characteristics of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this paper constructs an index system of human well-being including four dimensions: income and consumption, means of production, means of subsistence, and resource acquisition ability. Then, it uses generalized matrix method estimations to measure the influence of energy utilization and economic development on human well-being and makes a regression analysis on the influence of energy utilization and economic development on human well-being in various provinces in this region. It is found that per capita GDP and coke utilization promote the well-being of all dimensions, while the urban registered unemployment rate only promotes the well-being of means of subsistence. The utilization of gasoline and natural gas promotes income and consumption and inhibits the means of subsistence and resource acquisition ability, but they have opposite effects on means of production. The impacts of energy utilization and economic development in different provinces on human well-being are different. This study is of great significance to the related research aiming at improving people’s livelihood and promoting regional development. © 2020 by the authors.

Health impacts from corn production pre-and post-NAFTA trade agreement (1986–2013),"Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a powerful methodology for the study of health impacts and public policies. We performed this study to quantitatively explain the potential health impacts on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of corn produced in Mexico and imported from the United States of America (U.S.) from 1984 until 2014. The processes are hybrid and organic corn production. The functional unit was defined as 1 ton of corn production. Results indicate a total value of 178,431, 244,175, and 283,426 DALYs of three decades: 1984–1993, 1994–2003, and 2004–2013, of Mexican production; the U.S. production and transport were also calculated, showing values of 29,815, 65,837, and 107,729 for the same three decades. Additionally, DALYs were obtained for the category of human health and climate change by functional unit: 802.31 (1984–1993), 802.67 (1994–2003), and 803.92 (2004–2013), and for imported corn transported to Mexico from the U.S., 859.12 (1984–2013). DALYs on human toxicity were obtained: 99.05 (1984–1993), 99.05 (1994–2003), and 99.04 (2004–2013), and for the corn imported and transported to Mexico from the U.S., 116.25 (1984–2013). Conclusions: Environmental and health impacts in terms of DALYs are higher when corn is imported versus the corn produced in Mexico. Environmental health and nominal corn cultivation and transport impacts have increased as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico needs to redefine its public policies to suffer less of an environmental burden from corn to ensure global environmental health and food security. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
Shifting Habits Toward Sustainability: An Exploratory Research,"A worldwide environmental concern has taken place mid-way through the 20th century with the discovery of a triple planetary crisis (global warming, natural resources depletion and pollution) menacing the existence of human civilization. To face this distress, a governed form has taken place with the creation of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) in 1972, setting sustainable goals “using science, diplomacy and public outreach” (Lin & Hsu, 2015; Palacios‐González & Chamorro‐Mera, 2021; UNEP, 2022). Ever since, substantial efforts have been made on different scales to maintain the ecosystem. Governments have taken actions to encourage citizens to shift toward a more sustainable lifestyle, yet the UNEP are still far from meeting their “Sustainable Development Goals” because of large disengagement on the individual-level (Gifford & Nilsson, 2014). Therefore this paper is set with the objectives of explaining the process of behavioral change and identifying its determinants and motives in hopes of encouraging sustainable consumerism. Specifically, we address the impact of consumption habits on the intention-behavior gap and explore potential habit-breaking strategies and environmental cues to overcome it. The complex nature and dynamics of the environmental context in which consumers are situated have led them to adjust their attitudes and behaviors accordingly. © Academy of Marketing Science 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
A declaration on the value of experiential measures of food and water insecurity to improve science and policies in Latin America and the Caribbean,"Background: Water security is necessary for good health, nutrition, and wellbeing, but experiences with water have not typically been measured. Given that measurement of experiences with food access, use, acceptability, and reliability (stability) has greatly expanded our ability to promote food security, there is an urgent need to similarly improve the measurement of water security. The Water InSecurity Experiences (WISE) Scales show promise in doing so because they capture user-side experiences with water in a more holistic and precise way than traditional supply- side indicators. Early use of the WISE Scales in Latin American & the Caribbean (LAC) has revealed great promise, although representative data are lacking for most of the region. Concurrent measurement of experiential food and water insecurity has the potential to inform the development of better-targeted interventions that can advance human and planetary health. Main text: On April 20–21, 2023, policymakers, community organizers, and researchers convened at Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City to discuss lessons learned from using experiential measures of food and water insecurity in LAC. At the meeting’s close, organizers read a Declaration that incorporated key meeting messages. The Declaration recognizes the magnitude and severity of the water crisis in the region as well as globally. It acknowledges that traditional measurement tools do not capture many salient water access, use, and reliability challenges. It recognizes that the WISE Scales have the potential to assess the magnitude of water insecurity more comprehensively and accurately at community, state, and national levels, as well as its (inequitable) relationship with poverty, poor health. As such, WISE data can play an important role in ensuring more accountability and strengthening water systems governance through improved public policies and programs. Declaration signatories express their willingness to promote the widespread use of the WISE Scales to understand the prevalence of water insecurity, guide investment decisions, measure the impacts of interventions and natural shocks, and improve public health. Conclusions: Fifty-three attendees endorsed the Declaration – available in English, Spanish and Portuguese— as an important step to making progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 6, “Clean Water and Sanitation for All”, and towards the realization of the human right to water. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency

Dynamics and determinants of land change in India: integrating satellite data with village socioeconomics,"We examine the dynamics and spatial determinants of land change in India by integrating decadal land cover maps (1985–1995–2005) from a wall-to-wall analysis of Landsat images with spatiotemporal socioeconomic database for ~630,000 villages in India. We reinforce our results through collective evidence from synthesis of 102 case studies that incorporate field knowledge of the causes of land change in India. We focus on cropland–fallow land conversions, and forest area changes (excludes non-forest tree categories including commercial plantations). We show that cropland to fallow conversions are prominently associated with lack of irrigation and capital, male agricultural labor shortage, and fragmentation of land holdings. We find gross forest loss is substantial and increased from ~23,810 km2 (1985–1995) to ~25,770 km2 (1995–2005). The gross forest gain also increased from ~6000 km2 (1985–1995) to ~7440 km2 (1995–2005). Overall, India experienced a net decline in forest by ~18,000 km2 (gross loss–gross gain) consistently during both decades. We show that the major source of forest loss was cropland expansion in areas of low cropland productivity (due to soil degradation and lack of irrigation), followed by industrial development and mining/quarrying activities, and excessive economic dependence of villages on forest resources. © 2016, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Variability and time series trend analysis of rainfall in the mid-hill sub humid zone: a case study of Nauni,"The spatiotemporal variability of rainfall, particularly in the context of climate change, has been imperative for examining the cropping patterns, farming sustainable crop production, and food security in rainfed areas. To that end, trend analysis was done to study the change in rainfall patterns in the mid-hills of Himachal Pradesh. The study investigated the historical rainfall data from 1971 to 2020 on a monthly, annual, seasonal, and decadal basis by using the variability analysis methods, viz., standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variance (CV), and transformed annual precipitation departure (Z). The trend analysis was also done by Mann–Kendall (MK) and Sen’s slope estimator (SSE) test and linear regression model. The annual rainfall in the region was 1115.1 mm, which showed a decreasing trend (Z = − 0.79 mm/year). Based on the linear regression model, the decrease in annual rainfall was about − 2.28 mm/year. The monthly and seasonal variability of rainfall exhibited a sensitivity to change. The months of January, April, July, and September showed an increasing trend, whereas the rest of the other months showed a decreasing trend. The seasonal rainfall (summer, monsoon, and post-monsoon) showed a decreasing trend, whereas the winter season depicted an increasing trend. During the entire study period, 1988 recorded as the wettest year, with highest annual rainfall of about 2205.0 mm and monsoon rainfall of about 1653.0 mm. The highest annual (2205.0 mm) and monsoon (1653.0 mm) rainfall was recorded in the year 1988. The decadal analysis of the rainfall on an annual basis revealed a decrease in rainfall during the periods 1971–1980, 2001–2010, and 2011–2020 as compared to 1981–1990 and 1991–2000. The rainfall over the study region confirms the strength of the change in trend. Thus, the erratic rainfall pattern makes the cropping calendar shorter and affects the agricultural productivity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
TAX JUSTICE AND GLOBAL INEQUALITY: PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS TO PROTECT DEVELOPING COUNTRY REVENUES,"In the wake of the Panama Papers scandal and similar leaks, tax havens are now firmly in the spotlight. Today, roughly half of all global trade still passes through tax haven jurisdictions, costing millions in lost revenue to countries around the world. Such practices affect all of us, but are most keenly felt by poorer people in developing countries, where unfair tax practices have become a major obstacle to development, and which have allowed multinational corporations to continue to exploit developing economies. This collection argues that, for developing countries to achieve social justice and lasting prosperity, they must take control of their own tax destinies, and that this will also be crucial to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Covering such topics as natural resource management, representation in global tax institutions and effective strategies for building and protecting tax bases, the collection brings together expertise from a variety of countries and disciplines. It explores the options available to developing countries, and provides a basis for concerted action by tax authorities, policy makers, academics and civil society experts to design tax systems that can sustain a just society. © The Comparative Research Project on Poverty (CROP) 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
Water footprint assessment and its importance in Indian context: a meta-review,"With the increasing population and per capita demand for freshwater, the burden of natural resources has increased many folds. Indian agriculture is still largely dependent on conventional methods of crop production that are mainly inefficient. Water security is essential for social and economic development, having an indispensable role in enhancing health, well-being, and economic progress, particularly in a developing country like India. Water footprint (WF) is an important indicator that helps ascertain the direct and indirect use of water in any process. WF modeling in agriculture enables us to pinpoint the impacts and limitations of the current crop production system. Assessing vulnerabilities across various regions and time helps us prepare actions to improve water productivity and promote sustainable water use. There is considerable spatial variability in blue, green, and gray WF among the different states of India due to their varied climate, soil, and topographic characteristics. WF assessment is critical for developing water allocation strategies, planning water trade, making policies and implementing remedial measures.

Social theorists, especially human geographers, have rightfully criticized that the underlying politics of resilience have been ignored and stress the importance of asking “resilience of what, to what, and for whom?” This paper calls for careful consideration of not just resilience for whom and what, but also where, when, and why. A three-phase process is introduced to enable these “five Ws” to be negotiated collectively and to engender critical reflection on the politics of urban resilience as plans, initiatives, and projects are conceived, discussed, and implemented. Deployed through the hypothetical case of green infrastructure in Los Angeles, the paper concludes by illustrating how resilience planning trade-offs and decisions affect outcomes over space and time, often with significant implications for equity. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Water productivity (WP) in reservoir irrigated schemes in the upper east region (UER) of Ghana,"Improving water productivity is one important strategy for addressing future water scarcity, which is driven particularly by increasing human population and potential climate and land use changes. Although an understanding of water productivity is required to develop improved water management strategies, little is known about it in irrigated systems of the sub-Saharan Africa. This study assesses the physical crop water productivity at farm and scheme scales for two distinct systems: a medium and small reservoir in semi-arid environment of the Upper East Region in Ghana. The study concludes that water productivity for the study reservoirs is low, and that potential for improvement exists through improved irrigation water management and agronomic practices. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate change and climate variability: Adaptations to reduce adverse health impacts,"Global climate change is likely to have a range of consequences for human health as a result of disturbance or weakening of the biosphere's natural or human-managed life support systems. The full range of potential human health impacts of global climate change is diverse and would be distributed differentially spatially and over time. Changes in the mortality toll of heatwaves and changes in the distribution of vector-borne infectious diseases may occur early. The public health consequences of sea level rise and of regional changes in agricultural productivity may not occur (or become apparent) for several decades. Vulnerability is a measure of both sensitivity to climate change and the ability to adapt in anticipation of, or in response to, its impacts. The basic modes of adaptation to climate-induced health hazards are biological, behavioural and social. Adaptation can be undertaken at the individual, community and whole-population levels. Adaptive strategies should not introduce new health hazards. Enhancement of the acknowledged public health infrastructure and intervention programmes is essential to reduce vulnerability to the health impacts of climate change. In the longer- term, fundamental improvements in the social and material conditions of life and in the reduction of inequalities within and between populations are required for sustained reduction in vulnerability to environmental health hazards.",Not About Sufficiency

Marine Protected Areas: Evolving to Meet Changing Conditions,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) – clearly defined spaces dedicated to achieving long-term conservation of nature and nature's values – have been identified as one of the most effective tools for safeguarding marine ecosystems. Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs) are increasingly recognized as an additional tool to achieve global biodiversity goals. As governments refine their conservation targets over the next decade and beyond, it is timely to discuss the role of MPAs and OECMs in meeting global biodiversity and sustainable development goals. Key areas needing improvement to achieve these goals include broader engagement with Indigenous peoples and community groups and increased sustainable financing and management effectiveness. In addition, MPAs and OECMs must be designed and managed to address climate change and include targeted restoration to promote recovery to effectively conserve marine ecosystems and support human needs. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Country-level analysis of household fuel transitions,"Solid fuel combustion remains a dominant energy source for household heating and cooking in less developed countries. As a result, almost three billion people are exposed to household air pollution, causing four million premature deaths annually, primarily among poor women and children. We analyze data from Demographic and Health Surveys in 69 countries to identify determinants of transition from solid to cleaner fuel. Estimates from a population-averaged linear model show that population density and size, rural population share, income inequality, and charcoal production are positively associated with countries’ solid fuel use, while GDP per capita, electricity and natural gas production have the opposite effect. Economic development, measured as GDP per capita, has the strongest link to solid fuel use: a standard deviation increase in per capita GDP above its mean reduces solid fuel use from 70% to 57% of households. Electricity production is another strong predictor: solid fuel use drops by 11% when electricity production increases by one standard deviation above the mean. In addition, in a fixed-effects linear model, population size has a positive association with solid fuel use, while increases in GDP per capita and the number of governments’ renewable energy incentives are associated with lower dependence on solid fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Denser and greener cities: Green interventions to achieve both urban density and nature,"Green spaces in urban areas—like remnant habitat, parks, constructed wetlands, and street trees—supply multiple benefits. Many studies show green spaces in and near urban areas play important roles harbouring biodiversity and promoting human well-being. On the other hand, evidence suggests that greater human population density enables compact, low-carbon cities that spare habitat conversion at the fringes of expanding urban areas, while also allowing more walkable and livable cities. How then can urban areas have abundant green spaces as well as density? In this paper, we review the empirical evidence for the relationships between urban density, nature, and sustainability. We also present a quantitative analysis of data on urban tree canopy cover and open space for United States large urbanized areas, as well as an analysis of non-US Functional Urban Areas in OECD countries. We found that there is a negative correlation between population density and these green spaces. For Functional Urban Areas in the OECD, a 10% increase in density is associated with a 2.9% decline in tree cover. We argue that there are competing trade-offs between the benefits of density for sustainability and the benefits of nature for human well-being. Planners must decide an appropriate density by choosing where to be on this trade-off curve, taking into account city-specific urban planning goals and context. However, while the negative correlation between population density and tree cover is modest at the level of US urbanized areas (R2 = 0.22), it is weak at the US Census block level (R2 = 0.05), showing that there are significant brightspots, neighbourhoods that manage to have more tree canopy than would be expected based upon their level of density. We then describe techniques for how urban planners and designers can create more brightspots, identifying a typology of urban forms and listing green interventions appropriate for each form. We also analyse policies that enable these green interventions illustrating them with the case studies of Curitiba and Singapore. We conclude that while there are tensions between density and urban green spaces, an urban world that is both green and dense is possible, if society chooses to take advantage of the available green interventions and create it.

Sustainable weed management - What is it and how are we doing?,"The topic of sustainability is popular in mainstream media and a common discussion theme, particularly for the agriculture discipline that serves the entire world. Individuals and corporations often have a desire to be sustainable in their practices, but the commentary on being sustainable can be confusing in terms of realistic practices. To define whether weed science is sustainable one must first identify the resource or object to be sustained. From a historical perspective, weed control in the United States over the past 40 yr has revolved around no-tillage row crop acres. The implementation of no-till or reduced till has undeniable benefits in sustaining natural resources, especially two of our most valuable resources: soil and water. While the overall trend toward chemical weed control has been shown to decrease agriculture's impact on the environment, depending solely on herbicides is not sustainable long term with the rise in herbicide-resistant weed species. We also consider the benefits and challenges associated with agronomic trends within the context of sustainability and expand consideration to include emerging technology aligned to human health and environmental stewardship. The key to improving farming is producing more and safer food, feed, and fiber on less land while reducing adverse environmental effects, and this must be accomplished with the backdrop of human population growth and the desire for an improved standard of living globally. Emerging technologies provide new starting points for sustainable weed management solutions, and the weed science community can initiate the conversation on sustainable practices and share advancements with our colleagues and community members. In addition to broadening the sustainability concept, targeted and relevant communication tools will support the weed science community to have successful and impactful discussions. © 2023 The Author(s).

Working wetland potential: An index to guide the sustainable development of African wetlands,"Past experience shows that inappropriate agricultural development in wetlands can undermine sustainability and may have profound social and economic repercussions for people dependent on the range of ecosystem services provided by those wetlands. Nonetheless, there is escalating pressure to expand agriculture within wetlands due to increasing population, in conjunction with efforts to increase food security. This paper describes the development of a semi-analytical framework for identifying, organizing and analyzing the complex factors that link people, agriculture and wetland ecosystems -an index of Working Wetland Potential (WWP). The method is based on a form of multi-criteria analysis that integrates biophysical and socio-economic aspects of wetland utilization. The WWP index emerges from the aggregation of two values: the first arising from an appraisal of both the biophysical and socio-economic suitability of using the wetland for agriculture; and the second resulting from an assessment of the possible hazards, in relation to both social welfare and the ecological character of the wetland. Hence, the approach provides a way to explicitly integrate biophysical and social aspects of wetland utilization in a single index to enable an initial assessment of the suitability of using a wetland for agriculture. Results from three contrasting wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa are presented. © 2009 United Nations.",Not About Sufficiency
Lifting of the hunting ban and the elephant debate in Botswana: Implications for conservation and development in Southern Africa,"Worldwide, trophy hunting remains a contested and controversial issue. This chapter analyses the lifting of the hunting ban and the elephant debate in Botswana. It further analyses its implications to conservation and development in Southern Africa. This analysis is informed by the socio-ecological theory and draws from qualitative fieldwork, before and after the hunting ban. This includes a series of key informant interviews, review of government and community-based organisations’ materials, sustained engagement with domestic and international media reports and social media content (Facebook and Twitter). Data on trophy hunting, human-wildlife interactions and wildlife conservation were collected. The reintroduction of hunting in 2019 in Botswana sparked an international outcry, especially from citizens of the Global North. The ever-increasing elephant population in Botswana has caused economic and social and food insecurity for citizens of Botswana. Despite differences between the Global North and South, trophy hunting provides incentives for wildlife conservation and rural communities’ development. Trade bans by some Western countries and trade restrictions by CITES also affect local economies in the Global South. In conclusion, any policy shifts that affect wildlife conservation and rural livelihoods need to be informed by a socio-ecological approach. This participatory and scientific approach to decision-making has the potential to contribute to sustainable livelihoods and wildlife conservation in Botswana and southern Africa. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Lesego Senyana Stone, Moren Tibabo Stone, Patricia Kefilwe Mogomotsi and Goemeone E.J.

"Illegal dumping of toxic waste and its effect on human health in Campania, Italy","The region of Campania (particularly Naples and Caserta) has experienced an emergency in the waste management cycle during past years. Although the most critical phase has been overcome after the construction of the incineration plant in Acerra (an old-fashioned technology built up over a few months, whose impact on environment and health has not yet been assessed), most of the underlying problems have not been resolved. The illegal burning of wheels, plastics, textiles, and other industrial residuals, along with the detection of two thousand toxic substance dumping sites, still represents major concerns of environmental pollution and population health. This review summarizes the most relevant studies, which analyzed chemical contamination (primarily dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) of the air, soil, water, animals, and humans in Campania. In addition, we reviewed information on population health (i.e., mortality data, congenital malformations, and cancer incidence). Moving from a detailed mapping of (mostly illegal) waste dumping sites in Campania, we have focused on recent studies which have found: (a) high concentrations of dioxins (≥5.0 pg TEQ/g fat) in milk samples from sheep, cows, and river buffaloes; (b) remarkable contamination of dioxin and PCBs in human milk samples from those living in the Naples and Caserta areas (PCDDs+PCDFs and dioxin-like-PCBs (dl-PCBs) assessed at 16.6 pg TEQ/g of fat; range: 7.5–43 pg/g of fat); (c) potential age-adjusted standardized mortality rates associated with some specific cancer types; (d) a statistically significant association between exposure to illegal toxic waste dumping sites and cancer mortality, even after adjustment by socio-economic factors and other environmental indicators. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Perceived Impact of Climate Change on the Livelihoods of Smallholder Farmers in Kwazulu-Natal Province, South Africa","Smallholder farming is an important livelihood strategy for rural households in developing countries. Climate change and variability threaten the sustenance of livelihoods and hinder efforts to eradicate poverty and food insecurity. Although perception studies on climate change and coping mechanisms have been conducted in KwaZulu-Natal Province, little has been done on livelihood analysis. This study uses the Sustainable Livelihood Framework for livelihoods analysis of smallholder farmers in the uMkhanyakude district of KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa. Survey data were collected from a sample of 400 smallholder farmers in two local municipalities of the district, using a stratified random sampling procedure. Focus group discussions were used to augment survey data. Descriptive statistics were generated to analyse quantitative data, while qualitative data were analysed through thematic analysis. This study found that climate change significantly eroded livelihood assets, posing a threat to the well-being of smallholder farmers. Persistent drought has led to poor crop and livestock productivity, compelling households to rely heavily on food purchases. These findings underscore the urgent need to safeguard the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in the face of climate change. This study recommends that policymakers should focus on policies that enhance the resilience of livelihood assets for farming communities to minimise climatic risk. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The Imperative for Integrating Climate Change Concept into Universal Health Coverage Framework,"Climate change is at the fore of the most pressing global problems in the contemporary world. The impact of the changing climate, particularly on public health, is unprecedented, with health problems ranging from respiratory and heart diseases, pest-related diseases, and water- and food-related illnesses, among others. Health was declared a fundamental human right after the 1948 World Health Organization discussions. After that, Member States ultimately committed to attaining the highest level of health for all. Building upon these commitments, Universal Health Coverage (UHC) emerged based on the United Nations General Assembly under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Resolution (A/RES/70/1), asserting Member States to speed up progress toward UHC in an equitable manner. This study argues that UHC’s progress is threatened by climate change through aggravating disease patterns, destruction of healthcare infrastructure, exacerbating food insecurity, compromising air quality, and other health-related hazards. The following three questions underpin the study objectives: (a) What are UHC’s current thematic interests? (b) How are these UHC interests interfered with by climate change? (c) How can these interferences be addressed within the UHC framework to safeguard its objectives? All 243 articles studied point to climate change as one global threat to the five thematic areas of UHC: healthcare promotion, disease prevention, disease treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care. The findings will contribute to the ongoing policy debate about how building a solid UHC and safeguarding public healthcare will largely depend on addressing climate change and its impacts. Secondly, the study identified how climate change and UHC are inextricably linked, and the urgency to address this interplay. Thirdly, the findings will contribute to SDG 3-Good Health and Wellbeing, and SDG 13-Climate Action. Lastly, the investigation paves the way for more research, particularly in climate change and diseases, climate change and AMRs, and climate change and the health vulnerability of some groups of people, essentially the women, children, and the very old. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Cultivation potential projections of breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) under climate change scenarios using an empirically validated suitability model calibrated in Hawai’i,"Humanity faces significant challenges to agriculture and human nutrition, and changes in climate are predicted to make such challenges greater in the future. Neglected and underutilized crops may play a role in mitigating and addressing such challenges. Breadfruit is a long-lived tree crop that is a nutritious, carbohydrate-rich staple, which is a priority crop in this regard. A fuzzy-set modeling approach was applied, refined, and validated for breadfruit to determine its current and future potential productivity. Hawai’i was used as a model system, with over 1,200 naturalized trees utilized to calibrate a habitat suitability model and 56 producer sites used to validate the model. The parameters were then applied globally on 17 global climate models at the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 global climate projections for 2070. Overall, breadfruit suitability increases in area and in quality, with larger increases occurring in the RCP 8.5 projection. Current producing regions largely remain unchanged in both projections, indicating relative stability of production potential in current growing regions. Breadfruit, and other tropical indigenous food crops present strong opportunities for cultivation and food security risk management strategies moving forward. © 2020 Mausio et al.

Carbon sequestration from bamboo biochar on the productivity of ultisols and soybean [Glycine max L.] plants,"Soil carbon is very important in food security, ecosystems, and environmental health, especially in the context of global climate change. This study was to determine the effect of carbon sequestration from bamboo biochar on increasing the productivity of marginal soils in the second planting season planted with soybean [Glycine max L.]. This study used a completely randomized design with 3 replications in 5 treatments: A = 0.0% [0g pot-1] B = 0.5% [173g pot-1]; C = 1.0% [348g pot-1]; D = 1.5% [520g pot-1] and E = 2.0 [693g pot-1] of bamboo biochar. The results showed that carbon sequestration from bamboo biochar had a significant effect on the chemical properties of Ultisols, such as increasing pH, available P, organic C, total N, CEC, and Ca-exch and could reduce Al-exch, by 0.90 units, 2.50 ppm P, 1.12% C, 0.13% N, 5.48; 1.79 and 0.88 cmolckg-1, compared to controls and increase in soybean growth and NPK nutrient uptake in stems and leaves [3.57g N, 2.61g P, 4.64g K], also in roots [0.93g N, 1.03g P, 0.94g K], compared to controls.

Ignoring the courts: A contextual analysis of administrative nonacquiescence,"Increasingly complex environmental challenges reveal the necessity of creative, decisive regulatory solutions. Effective public policy responses to the distributional effects of a changing climate require nuanced analysis and collaborative effort by each branch of government. The analysis supporting the D.C. Circuit's recent endorsement of the Environmental Protection Agency's new policy of intercircuit nonacquiescence falls short of the nuance required to address the issues implicated. Specifically, in National Environmental Development Association's Clean Air Project v. EPA, the D.C. Circuit failed to evaluate the significance of agency nonacquiescence within the context of the ongoing Environmental Federalism debate. Continued debate over whether environmental regulations should be uniform and centrally enforced is the direct result of interdisciplinary efforts to analyze and mitigate human impacts on planetary health. This Note argues that a more prudent analysis of agency nonacquiescence would be context-specific, considering not only mere legal permissibility, but advisability as well.

A resilience lens to explore seaweed farmers’ responses to the impacts of climate change in Tanzania,"Seaweed-based mariculture is an important source of livelihoods for impoverished coastal communities in Tanzania. However, the impacts of climate change across East Africa are putting a strain on the growth of the seaweed industry. Smallholder farmers are already mobilizing strategies to cope with challenges such as disease outbreaks, but they are struggling to maintain seaweed production and derive sufficient income. A better understanding of the challenges they face and the factors inhibiting their ability to build resilience is needed to inform policies and development programmes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 13 on Climate action and Goal 14 on Life Below Water. The global demand for seaweed is expanding rapidly. Strengthening the adaptability of seaweed production to climate change is important for farmers to rely on it as a source of livelihoods on which they can build their own resilience to climate change. Drawing on qualitative data from key informant interviews in four Tanzanian seaweed-producing areas, this paper assesses the long-term resilience capacities of seaweed farmers to respond to one of the main hazards: diseases affecting seaweed crops. While several strategies help farmers maintain their income, most of them only support resilience in the short term. The increasing pressure on marine resources and the lack of regulations for supporting an equitable and sustainable seaweed-based mariculture sector do not bode well for farmers’ long-term adaptation to climate change and environmental degradation. Seaweed farming remains a crucial source of livelihoods for poor coastal communities in Tanzania, but it does not currently lead to positive transformative changes in their socio-economic conditions. Policies aiming to support sustainable aquaculture, particularly in tropical ecosystems that are highly vulnerable to climate change, must address the existing social, economic and knowledge inequities that prevent poor communities from building their resilience. © 2022 The Author(s).

Pacific island health inequities forecast to grow unless profound changes are made to health systems in the region,"Objective Twenty years ago the Pacific's health ministers developed a 'Healthy Islands' vision to lead health development in the subregion. This paper reports on a review of health development over this period and discusses the implications for the attainment of the health related Sustainable Development Goals. Methods The review used qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative review included conducting semi-structured interviews with Pacific Island Government Ministers and officials, regional agencies, health workers and community members. A document review was also conducted. The quantitative review consisted of examining secondary data from regional and global data collections. Results The review found improvement in health indicators, but increasing health inequality between the Pacific and the rest of the world. Many of the larger island populations were unable to reach the health Millennium Development Goals. The 'Healthy Islands' vision remained an inspiration to health ministers and senior officials in the region. However, implementation of the 'Healthy Islands' approach was patchy, under-resourced and un-sustained. Communicable and Maternal and Child Health challenges persist alongside unprecedented levels of non-communicable diseases, inadequate levels of health finance and few skilled health workers as the major impediments to health development for many of the Pacific's countries. Conclusions The current trajectory for health in the Pacific will lead to increasing health inequity with the rest of the world. The challenges to health in the region include persisting communicable disease and maternal and child health threats, unprecedented levels of NCDs, climate change and instability, as well as low economic growth. In order to change the fortunes of this region in the age of the SDGs, a substantial investment in health is required, including in the health workforce, by countries and donors alike. That investment requires a nuanced response that takes into account the contextual differences between and within Pacific islands, adherence to aid effectiveness principles and interventions designed to strengthen local health systems. What is known about the topic? It is well established that the Pacific island countries are experiencing the double disease burden, and that the non-communicable disease epidemic is more advanced. What does this paper add? This paper discusses the review of 20 years of health development in the Pacific. It reveals that although progress is being made, health development in the region is falling behind that of the rest of the world. It also describes the progress made by the Pacific countries in pursuit of the 'Healthy Islands' concept. What are the implications for practitioners? This paper has significant implications for Pacific countries, donor partners and development partners operating across and within Pacific countries. It calls for a substantial increase in health resourcing and the way development assistance is organised to arrest the increasing inequities in health outcomes between Pacific people and those of the rest of the world.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable circularity and intelligent data-driven operations and control of the wastewater treatment plant,"Rapid urbanization, population increase, emerging contaminants and increasing water scarcity have put a major constraint on the wastewater treatment system. Scarcity of water is steering current way of water recycle, and the drive focus towards resource recovery. Zero waste pathway in circular bioeconomy can bring transformation of wastewater commercialization by adding value with resource recovery. The complex biological reactions, unforeseen microbial behaviours, lack of reliable on-line instrumentation, complex modelling, lack of visualize techniques, low-quality industrial measurements and highly time-varying intensive data-driven operations call for the intelligence techniques and operations. The study is a review of sustainable circularity and intelligent data-driven operations and control of the wastewater treatment plant. Water surveillance and monitoring, circular economy and sustainability, automation pyramid, digital transformation, artificial intelligence, data pipeline, digital twin, data mining, and data-driven visualization, cyber-physical systems and water-energy-health management were reviewed. The deployment of the digital systems has evidently proven to bridges the gap between the data-driven soft sensor, operation and control systems in WWTP. Accurate prediction of the WWTP variables can support process design and control, reduce operation cost, improve system reliability, predictive maintenance and troubleshooting, increase water quality, increase stakeholder's engagement and endorse optimization of the plant performance.

GREEN COLLARING A CAPITAL CRISIS?,"The global economic crisis has delivered a boost to ‘green collar’ employment in wealthy nations through sizeable injections of public stimulus funds. It is therefore timely to question what this means for relations between labour, capital and the ecosystem.

While critics of the growth imperative of capitalist political economies are skeptical of market-based approaches to averting destructive climate change and the associated social and ecological costs, governments, industry and organised labour are confident that this is the appropriate course of action to the current economic and climate crises. However, snapshots of labour conditions at the lower end of the green economy suggest that social justice notions of green jobs and the possibilities of a just transition are likely to be elusive aims in capitalist societies. © 2010, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatializing zoonotic disease dynamics from a political ecology perspective: Reconceptualizing spillover as structure,"Estimates that 60% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin, combined with recent high-profile zoonotic outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic, have the world scrambling to understand, predict, and prevent zoonotic disease risks and outbreaks. Scientists and public health officials draw attention to anthropogenic processes understood to contribute to these risks, such as the wildlife trade, climate change, deforestation, and urbanization. Rightly understood as a joint public health and human-environment challenge, what is being lost is an appreciation for the structural, systemic drivers of zoonotic disease risks, outbreaks, their spatialities, and related interventions. In this article, we articulate the need for this research and how political ecology can respond to it. Complementing existing work on political ecologies of health and disease, we develop a specific political ecology approach to examine the structural processes shaping the spatialities of zoonotic disease dynamics. This framework is intended to: 1. give critical attention to spatialities of animal-human-pathogen relations; 2. examine how and what political-economic, socio-cultural and other structural processes drive changes in these spatialities; and 3. investigate how changes in these spatialities intensify (or de-intensify) animal-human-pathogen relations and zoonotic risks. We use this framework to reconceptualize taken-for-granted and key components of zoonotic disease outbreaks – reservoirs, interfaces, and spillovers. We reframe reservoirs as bodies and landscapes that are spaces of zoonotic hazard; and interfaces as spaces of interspecies intimacy. From here, we explain why it is important to think about spillover not just as an event preceding an outbreak, but as a structured process that unfolds across space, time, and scale. Our intention is for others to enrich and advance this framework through application in different zoonotic disease contexts to critically examine how spaces of hazard, intimacy and spillover are shaped, and what this means for differentiated risks, vulnerabilities, and interventions. © (2025), (University of Arizona Libraries).

"Nanomaterials for environmental remediation: Investigating the role of nanoinformatics in support of environmental, health, and safety oversight of nanotechnologies at the local level","Nanotechnology is the science and practice of manipulating matter at or near atomic scale to create new materials of unique and novel properties for specific applications. Nanomaterials, including engineered nanoparticles (ENPs), have been used successfully for remediation since they are superior in technical performance and costeffectiveness than traditional remedial technologies. Evidence indicates, however, that exposure to nanomaterials may lead to significant safety and health impacts. To protect human health against undesired risks from nanomaterials requires that safe and sustainable development of nanotechnology is in tandem with the availability of relevant information. State agencies responsible for the environment, safety, and public health were surveyed to understand their current and future information needs and capabilities to regulate nanomaterials. Because significant data gaps still exist on the toxicity and ecological impacts of nanomaterials, precautionary measures should be taken. Research to develop techniques for exposure assessments, surveillance and monitoring, databases, and characteristics of workplaces where ENPs are used is encouraged. © copyright 2013, national environmental health Association (no refunds).",Not About Sufficiency

Urban Forests and Green Areas as Nature‐Based Solutions for Brownfield Redevelopment: A Case Study from Brescia Municipal Area (Italy),"Urban areas are experiencing major changes and facing significant sustainability chal-lenges. Many cities are undergoing a transition towards a post‐industrial phase and need to consider the regeneration of brownfield sites. Nature‐Based Solutions (NBSs) are increasingly considered as tools for supporting this transition and promoting sustainable development by delivering multiple ecosystem services (ESs). Although the potential of NBSs as a cost‐effective enabler of urban sus-tainability has been recognized, their implementation faces numerous barriers. The effective assessment of benefits delivered by urban NBSs is considered by existing literature as one of them. In order to contribute to filling this knowledge gap, we analyzed two alternative NBS‐based intervention scenarios—i.e., (1) an urban forest and (2) meadows with sparse trees—for the redevelopment of an urban brownfield area within the municipality of Brescia (Northern Italy). Nine ESs were as-sessed both in biophysical and economic terms via a combination of modeling (InVEST, i‐Tree and ESTIMAP) and traditional estimation methods. The results show that both scenarios improve ES stock and flow compared to the baseline, ensuring annual flows ranging between 140,000 and 360,000 EUR/year. Scenario 1 shows higher values when single ESs are considered, while scenario 2 shows higher total values, as it also accounts for the phytoremediation capacity that is not considered under the first scenario. All in all, regulating ESs represent the bulk of estimated ESs, thus highlighting the potential of proposed NBSs for improving urban resilience. The ES assessment and valuation exercise presented within this paper is an example of how research and practice can be integrated to inform urban management activities, and provide inputs for future decision making and planning regarding urban developments. © 2022 by the authors.

Cleome gynandra: A wonder climate-smart plant for nutritional security for millions in semi-arid areas,"Spider plant (Cleome gynandra) is predominantly used as a traditional leafy vegetable throughout Africa and is considered a rich natural source of essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals and proteins. With the increase in malnutrition, diet related non-communicable diseases and poverty across the continent of Africa, the spider plant is a bona fide alternative healthy food crop to alleviate these challenges. Spider plant is an erect annual herb that could grow up to 150 cm tall, strongly branched, with a long taproot and few secondary roots. It is commonly consumed in resource-poor communities especially during times of major food scarcity. It is a drought-tolerant and resilient annual vegetable crop capable of growing well in a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions. Despite the potential benefits and wide adaptability, progressive attempts towards the development of C. gynandra as a crop have been impeded by issues like low investment in research and development resulting in poor seed quality, relatively low yields and susceptibility to pests and diseases. In this paper, we reviewed the research that has been done regarding its morphology, growing conditions, production and utilisation (i.e., nutrition). The current review highlighted the status of the science in advancing the domestication of C. gynandra as a potential power crop for several African countries. The review concluded that with the advancement of modern biotechnology techniques and genome sequencing, there is a compelling case for investment and development in C. gynandra as a candidate for managing micronutrient deficiencies during the post-pandemic era. Finally, the existing knowledge gaps (e.g., breeding) that necessitate explorations were identified and recommendations that could enhance its development and potential commercialisation were made.

Book overview,"Infrastructure services are fundamental to economic growth. Railways are an important part of world transportation infrastructure and have several advantages. Tanzania embarked on constructing a standard-gauge railway from Dar es Salaam to Mwanza, via Isaka, to combat climate change and boost the economy. However, construction is accompanied by clearing of reserved forests (Pugu-Kazimzumbwi, Ruvu South) and has an effect on biodiversity. This book provides baseline information and detailed analyses of land-use and land-cover changes, soil and biodiversity as a function of developmental activities. Findings have indicated that areas are under pressure from various illegal anthropogenic activities. This chapter provides mitigation measures that will reduce the effect on biodiversity and foster food security, poverty reduction and development. The information provided sets a path towards monitoring and evaluating such a big project and suggests implementation of mitigation measures to safeguard biodiversity. © CAB International 2024.

"Predicting the water requirement, soil moisture distribution, yield, water productivity of peas and impact of climate change using saltmed model","It's important to study the effect of climate change on crops and water supplies, during this critical period of water scarcity and increasing food demand. These changes include evapotranspiration, which will affect crop growth and water requirement. This research work explores the impacts of climate change on water requirements, soil moisture distribution, yield and water productivity of peas. Two consecutive field trials were conducted during the 2017 and 2018 growth seasons of peas in El Nubaria zone, Egypt, on sandy soil conditions. Two irrigation schedules were studied, the first is irrigation at 30% depletion of field capacity, FC, the second schedule irrigation used actual weather station data under drip irrigation system. Under both irrigation schedules, measured and observed data were used for calibration and validation of the SALTMED model. The model was tested to study the impact of the future scenarios (RCPs, 4.5 and 8.5) for 2040, on water requirements, soil moisture content, yield and water productivity of peas, for the same study conditions. The field data indicated there was a high uniformity of soil moisture distribution under the 30% depletion of FC irrigation schedule, compared with the irrigation schedule using weather station data, for both seasons. The highest yield was (2.7 and 3.3 t ha-1) for 2017 and 2018 seasons, respectively, under the 30% depletion of FC irrigation schedule. The highest water productivity was (0.95 and 1.07 kg m-3) with total applied of water (2840 and 3070 m3 ha-1) for 2017 and 2018 seasons, respectively, with irrigation at 30% depletion of FC. The calibration and validation of SALTMED model indicated there were a slight variations between the observed and simulated results, with high coefficients of determination, RMCE and CRM values for total dry matter, productivity, water productivity and soil moisture under both irrigation schedules and for both seasons. The predicted data using SALTMED model showed the crop water requirements will increase for RCPs, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios of 2040. The predicted yield and water productivity tend to decrease in 2040 under both scenarios. In general, SALTMED model is a good tool for predicting total dry matter and yield and can run with different scenarios and under different conditions. © 2020 Plant Archives.

Strip cropping system as a climate adaptation strategy in semi-arid Alfisols of South Central India,"A two year (2013-2015) field experiment was conducted to assess the efficiency of rainfed strip intercropping of sorghum (S) and pigeonpea (PP) under 4:4 replacement series in comparison with 2:1 intercropping under additive series for system productivity, economic efficiency and farm family food security. There were three treatment combinations (S+ PP -relay horsegram (HG), S+ PP -ratoon S and S+ PP -sequence HG) accommodating an opportune crop of relay or sequence HG to be tested against checks of sole crops. S and PP strip system in a high rainfall year (2013) yielded 31% higher grain than 2:1 S and PP intercropping, but such advantages were not observed during a deficit rainfall year (2014). Significant PP yield increase during a high rainfall year in a strip system increased both water productivity (10.1 to 16.5 kg/ha/mm) and net returns (Rs 57490 to 71680/year). Similarly, during high rainfall year (2013), a superior diverse index (1.63 over 1.19) and production efficiency (19.6 over 13.5 kg/ha/day) was observed. Both relay/sequence cropped HG performed equally well while ratoon S performed poorly. Therefore, for changing climate, 4:4 strip intercropping of S and PP showed higher productivity and economic returns as compared to 2:1 intercropping system. Opportune cropping through relay or sequence HG can be successfully carried out in semi-arid regions during post monsoon season for climate change adaptation.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the impact of green hiring on sustainable performance: mediating role of green performance management and compensation,"The global need to preserve ecology has propelled the green movement across the globe. An emerging managerial challenge for all organizations is to protect natural resources by reducing their negative impact on the environment and increase sustainable performance. Greening is the need of the age to conserve natural resources. This study investigates the impact of green human resource management practice—i.e., green hiring—on the sustainable performance of public and private healthcare organizations. A quantitative research approach was used for data collection. Scale survey of 160 responses was gathered from public and private healthcare organizations. Partial least square–structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. The study results suggest that green recruitment has a positive and significant impact on environmental perfor-mance, economic performance, and social performance. Path coefficients test also revealed that green performance management and compensation significantly mediate the relationship between green hiring and sustainable performance of public and private healthcare organizations. This study is helpful for organizations in adapting GHRM practices that will benefit the organizations in all ways. This study also provides a better understanding to policymakers on how to promote GHRM practices and increase sustainability in organizations. © 2021 by the authors.

Assessing the energy system's greenhouse emissions via the health of Smart Territories and Cities,"The aim of this paper is to understand how the main drivers of air pollution and greenhouse emissions impact public health in a Smart Territory — meaning a technologically integrated city or neighborhood — as well as how to design an optimized energy system model beyond only data by including the holistic experience of its people through phenomenology and ethics. We understand that a Territory and a City is a complex system where mathematical tool modeling known as Design of Experiment (DOE) and its optimization solutions are required to establish causality and identify the variables that have a broader impact on public health so that mortality rates due to air pollution are reduced. DOE's statistical branch is a novel methodology when applied to energy systems and the design of Smart Territories and Cities. Because of it, we have been able to demonstrate how energy emissions, capacity and Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) affect the mortality rate and create the foundations for building fully decarbonised energy systems enhanced by mathematical solutions. However, the Cartesian approach of extrapolating from models which align themselves with economic growth alone will not solve the energy dilemma. In fact, the current energy transition project is based on outdated archetypes that lead to scary futures. To course-correct the problematic energy model of a Smart Territory, phenomenologists and creative imagination need to be cultivated and put into action together with mathematical modeling, leading to vectors of positive change and adaptation. Only then might the energy models designed to be reproducible could became ethically virtuous and therefore accepted by the Territory's co-dwellers within the chain of causalities. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Catalyzing innovation: Governance enablers of nature-based solutions,"There is growing recognition that using the properties of nature through nature-based solutions (NBS) can help to provide viable and cost-effective solutions to a wide range of societal challenges, including disaster risk reduction (DRR). However, NBS realization depends critically on the governance framework that enables the NBS policy process. Drawing from three case studies in Nocera Inferiore (Italy), Munich (Germany), and Wolong (China), we identify key governance ena-blers—the contextual preconditions, policy processes, and institutions—that proved essential for NBS initiation, planning, design, and implementation. In the three cases, interviews confirm the success of the NBS measures and their benefits in terms not only of DRR but of multiple ecological and social–economic co-benefits. Results highlight critical governance enablers of NBS, including: polycentric governance (novel arrangements in the public administration that involved multiple institutional scales and/or sectors); co-design (innovative stakeholder participatory processes that influenced the final NBS); pro-NBS interest and coalition groups (organized pressure groups that advocated for an NBS); and financial incentives (financing community-based implementation and monitoring of NBS). Findings show that the transition to NBS can contribute to multiple global agendas, including DRR, climate change adaptation, and sustainable development. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

"Engendering the right to food? International human rights law, food security and the rural woman","International human rights bodies such as the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food and the UN Human Rights Council are increasingly engaging with issues of gender equality in connection with the rights to food, land and other natural resources. These monitoring mechanisms often partially attribute gender-based inequalities in land rights and food security to the influences of discriminatory local customary norms and harmful cultural practices as well as to broader questions of economic development, environmental degradation and unequal service delivery that are viewed as particularly affecting women in rural areas. This paper interrogates the discourses of international human rights mechanisms in relation to the rural woman and her right to food. Focusing in particular on the history and development of Article 14 of the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, it examines the dominant narratives being constructed about gendered food insecurity and unequal land rights at the international level and the manner in which these are embodied through discussions of the role and status of rural women. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency

Low climate stabilisation under diverse growth and convergence scenarios,"In the last decade a number of papers have analysed the consequences of achieving the greenhouse gas concentration levels necessary to maintain global temperature increases below 2. °C above preindustrial levels. Most models and scenarios assume that future trends in global GDP will be similar to the growth experienced in the past century, which would imply multiplying current output by about 19 times in the 21st century. However, natural resource and environmental constraints suggest that future global economic growth may not be so high. Furthermore, the environmental implications of such growth depend on how it is distributed across countries. This paper studies the implications on GHG abatement policies of low global GDP growth and high convergence levels in GDP per capita across countries. A partial equilibrium model (POLES) of the world's energy system is used to provide detailed projections up to 2050 for the different regions of the world. The results suggest that while low stabilisation could be technically feasible and economically viable for the world in all the scenarios considered, it is more likely to occur with more modest global growth. However, that will imply higher global abatement costs relative to GDP. Convergence in living standards on the other hand places greater pressures in terms of the required reduction in emissions. In general we find that there are major differences between regions in terms of the size and the timing of abatement costs and economic impact. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Post-disaster food insecurity: Hurricane Maria as a case study,"Background: Food insecurity is traditionally defined as a chronic condition linked to insufficient income, but in post-disaster contexts the condition may differ significantly, often with sudden onset and temporary nature. There is no specific definition for post-disaster food insecurity, making accurate data collection and development of effective interventions difficult. Methods: To explore this issue, we performed a pilot survey study (n = 22) in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria to evaluate food insecurity status, duration, and causes. Results: Over half of respondents self-reported experiencing food insecurity following Hurricane Maria. In general, food insecure respondents experienced more specific food group shortages that lasted longer than food secure respondents. The duration of food shortages significantly influenced participants' perceptions of food insecurity. The primary causes of food insecurity were identified as grocery store closures, a lack of food in stores, or other reasons not listed in the survey. These findings support what is known about the post-disaster setting with supply chain issues being a prominent mechanism of food insecurity as well as there being multiple mechanisms difficult to describe due to the complexity of the situation. Conclusions: Results highlight the need for refined definitions and assessments of post-disaster food insecurity that account for the temporal aspects of food shortages and the complexity of post-disaster settings. As climate change exacerbates the frequency and severity of natural disasters, addressing the nuances of post-disaster food insecurity is increasingly urgent to mitigate associated health risks. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Comparison between Demand and Supply of Some Ecosystem Services in National Parks: A Spatial Analysis Conducted Using Italian Case Studies,"In recent decades, modeling approaches of ecosystem services (ES) have been used extensively at the international level, providing useful tools during the decision-making process by integrating both physical and economic information, thus improving its management. The relationship between supply and demand may impact social welfare: for example, a deficit in ES could negatively influence demand (either potential or effective). For this reason, the relational study between supply and demand is necessary for the sustainable management of natural resources; particularly since the demand for some ES must be fulfilled not only on a local scale but also globally (as in the case of regulatory ES). This paper proposes an ES analysis framework that links the flow of services (supply) generated by the interaction between natural, human and social capital with consumption (demand) connected to potential beneficiaries. Specifically, we analyze three ES: Forage production, regulation of local climate (PM10), and carbon sequestration in three national parks (Aspromonte National Park, Circeo National Park, and Appennino Tosco Emiliano National Park). The use of synthetic (biophysical) indicators, on a spatial basis, made it possible to quantify the supply and demand of specific catchments with the aim of accounting for the surplus/deficit through the calculation of the ES supply and demand ratio (ESDR). In fact, sustainable land management requires a balance between supply and demand in relation to the different needs of the stakeholders and local community. The relationship between supply and demand of ES can help identify resource use trade-offs, thus rendering the achievement of management and protection objectives more efficient. Lastly, through the use of monetary coefficients, it was possible to calculate the benefits of increasing the awareness of public decision-makers of ES’s value and the importance of implementing integrated strategies for environmental protection and enhancement. © 2021 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"The long history of environmental migration: Assessing vulnerability construction and obstacles to successful relocation in Shishmaref, Alaska","Migration decisions are complex and are linked to multiple vulnerabilities, including changing ecological conditions precipitated by climate change. As ecological thresholds are met, community-wide migrations will become more common. These community-wide migrations are more likely to occur to already vulnerable populations, and may levy high social costs. In order to prevent the negative outcomes associated with forced migration and diaspora, policy intervention is likely. Our research examines the case study of Shishmaref, Alaska, where relocation as an adaptation strategy to changing ecological conditions is the only sustainable option. We find that the colonial history in Shishmaref is explicitly linked to contemporary exposure to hazards and increased vulnerability. We further assess obstacles to a State sponsored relocation. These obstacles include disaster response protocol that does not adequately accommodate climate change scenarios. Relocation planning is further complicated by feelings of mis- and under-representation of local voices in political arenas. This case demonstrates the interrelatedness between historically constructed vulnerability and obstacles to adaptation planning. We also offer unique insight into the details of relocation planning as an adaptation strategy among one of the first community-wide migrations associated with climate change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Land-use trade-offs between tree biodiversity and crop production in the Atlantic Forest,"Trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) have received increasing attention because provisioning services often come at the expense of biodiversity loss. When land-use patterns are not maximally efficient relative to productivity, provisioning services, such as crop production, can often be increased without losing biodiversity. The Atlantic Forest (AF) encompasses dense, mixed, and seasonal forests and has high levels of endemism and anthropogenic threat. We examined trade-offs between biodiversity and crop production in the AF to provide insights into land-use management decisions. We developed a biodiversity metric that combines information on tree species richness, evolutionary distinctiveness, and rarity at the local level. We examined the extent to which the nature of ES trade-offs differ among the 3 forest types. We assessed how annual deforestation rates and land management practices affect biodiversity and agricultural revenues. Finally, we tested whether it is possible to achieve the same total regional revenue without reducing biodiversity by improving local management practices. The 3 forest types had similar patterns in ES trade-offs, although within mixed forest patterns differed. Biodiversity appeared to be more sensitive to land-use change than crop revenues. Certain crops yielded up to 10 times higher values in some sites. Enhanced crop productivity may increase revenues without reducing biodiversity. Our results showed that to enhance human well-being without further conversion of AF, maximizing crop productivity is needed. Increasing efficiency of management outcomes by maintaining higher biodiversity and increasing provisioning services depends on knowledge of forest type, the comparative advantage of planting crops in the best places, and preserving species in a balanced manner across forests. © 2018 Society for Conservation Biology",Not About Sufficiency
Systems analysis for energy assets of Iraq influenced by water scarcity,"Water security in arid and semi-arid Middle Eastern climates has been severely impacted by effects of climate change such as reduced precipitation, diminished storage, increased evapotranspiration, and prolonged heat waves. These climate effects are compounded in Iraq, where populations, agriculture, industry, and energy rely heavily on varying transboundary water flows to meet water demands. Iraq’s most profitable sector, energy, is especially threatened by insufficient water supply, which complicates government decision making in energy infrastructure development. The goal of this paper is to develop a scenario-based multi-criteria analysis framework to prioritize infrastructure investments in the context of climate change and scarcity of natural resources. Infrastructure facilities are evaluated against social, economic, climate, and hydrologic criteria across a set of disruptive climatological, economic, and social scenarios to identify robust initiatives and the most and least disruptive scenarios to the system. A particular innovation of this paper is the evaluation of hydrology data derived from satellites in determining water scarcity impact on individual energy facilities. The methods are demonstrated for a critical sector of Iraq’s economy: oil and natural gas. The demonstration includes 13 system-order criteria, 44 oil and gas initiatives within Iraq, and seven risk scenarios. The results include an accounting of the most and least disruptive scenarios to energy sector priorities and scenario-based system orderings to guide stakeholders in investment prioritization. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Renewable energy access challenge at household level for the poor in rural zimbabwe: Is biogas energy a remedy?,"This study examined Zimbabwe’s energy access situation and suggests that Zimbabwe’s energy access solution goes beyond providing biogas energy alone but needs addressing the root causes of Zimbabwe’s inability to access renewable energy. The paper also challenges biogas fuel prospects and shortcomings. A mixed-method methodology has been used. Next, the qualitative data analysis was carried out using thematic analysis. The themes emerging from the findings include lack of knowledge about biogas power, difficulties in accessing start-up capital, and lack of resources needed. From a quantitative viewpoint, it was discovered that lack of adequate funds, high installation costs, lack of adequate data and negative attitudes to the community are some of the challenges that block biogas to be considered as renewable energy for the poor in rural Domboshava, Zimbabwe at household level. Based on the findings of the article, organizational consequences are explored, and recommendations are made for shortcomings and future directions for analysis.

Post-harvest cereal structures and climate change resilience in rural Zimbabwe: A review,"Farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa use storage structures that help maintain grain quality and safety. This study reviewed the use of different grain storage structures used by smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe namely granaries, metal silos, supergrain bags, polypropylene bags and cribs. Metal silos and supergrain bags, however costly, have hermetic properties that kill pests while granaries dilapidate with time. Cribs are susceptible to moisture entry, while polypropylene bags are prone to perforations by sharp objects. This review discussed the impact of climate change on preservation of grain quality during storage. Moulds, insect pest infestations and rodent attacks are major challenges that cause storage losses. Knowledge barriers, cost, fear of the unknown, effectiveness of storage structure and security of grain are factors that affect the diversity of storage structure use. Proper use of storage structures contributes towards achieving sustainable development goals and increases farmer resilience to the impacts of climate change.

Impact of Humic Acid and Sulphur application on growth and yield of Indian Mustard under variable Water moisture regimes,"Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.) is an important oilseed crop cultivated in various regions of the world, particularly in India. However, its productivity faces limitations due to various abiotic factors, notably variable soil moisture. This study aimed to explore the influence of humic acid and sulphur application on Indian mustard growth and yield within different moisture regimes. A field experiment was conducted in rabi season, employing a split plot design with four replications. Four moisture treatments were imposed: (1) no post sowing irrigation, (2) one post sowing irrigation (3) two post sowing irrigation and (4) three post sowing irrigation. Within each moisture regime, four treatment groups were established: (A) control (no application), (B) humic acid alone, (C) sulphur alone, and (D) a combination of humic acid and sulphur. The results revealed significant improvements in various growth and yield parameters when humic acid and sulphur were applied, particularly under moisture stress conditions. Application of humic acid and sulphur enhanced root development, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic rate, which ultimately led to increased plant height, leaf area, and biomass accumulation. Notably, the combined application exhibited synergistic effects, resulting in the highest yield increments, especially under severe moisture stress. This study provides valuable insights into the potential advantages of incorporating humic acid and sulphur as soil amendments in Indian mustard cultivation, particularly in moisture-variable regions. The results highlight the combined application's effectiveness in mitigating water scarcity effects, thereby promoting sustainable agriculture and bolstering food security. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Lessons for sustainable development: Marine mammal conservation policies and its social and economic effects,"The objective of this research is to assess the main social and economic effects on local fishermen in El Golfo de Santa Clara, as a result of the severe fishing restrictions enforced to protect the marine mammal ""vaquita"" (Phocoena sinus). Sustainable development includes natural resources conservation and the improvement of the social and economic conditions of local inhabitants. In Mexico, the vaquita is in imminent danger of extinction. It is a marine cetacean endemic to the Upper Gulf of California. Conservation measures to save this species, such as gear-switching and transformation subsidies from fishing activities to tourist services, have caused severe social and economic impacts on the local fishermen of this region. Presently, it is estimated that there are only 30 vaquita individuals left in the wild, and none are in captivity. In this study, we conduct surveys of the human local population involved in the incidental bycatch fishing of the vaquita, and also use secondary sources to come up with recommendations, based on taking into account stakeholder needs. For this fishing community the economic and social problems have worsened because currently there are limited economic activity options in the area for the human population, and the vaquita population continues to decline. Recommendations are offered to contribute to the ecological sustainability of this species, and for economic and social sustainability of local fishermen. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Global catastrophe of hospital disasters: a retrospective analysis (1976–2023),"Hospitals are critical infrastructures that must remain operational during disasters, yet they often become disaster targets themselves. This study offers a global retrospective analysis of hospital disasters from 1976 to 2023, drawing on data from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). Our methodology combines a historical data review with an evaluation of the impact of technological advancements, community awareness, governmental policies, and psychological support mechanisms on disaster mitigation. By categorizing disasters into collapses, explosions, and fires, we specifically examine incidents leading to significant human casualties and property damage. This retrospective study employs quantitative analysis to identify trends and patterns in hospital disasters, utilizing statistical methods to assess data categorization by EM-DAT and to evaluate the frequency, severity and geographical disparities of these incidents. A notable increase in hospital fires highlights an urgent need for improved safety standards and preparedness.

Effect of water and rice straw management practices on yield and water productivity of irrigated lowland rice in the Central Plain of Thailand,"Rice cultivation techniques with less irrigation water input are crucial for global food security in the context of changing climate scenarios. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is among such water-saving techniques, which could potentially reduce irrigation water input for rice cultivation through alteration of soil submergence period with period of soil non-submergence (unsaturated soil conditions) during the growing season. Rice straw is often scattered in the field after harvest or burned in intensive rice cultivation systems. Response of irrigated lowland rice with respect to grain yield and water use under different water and rice straw management practices largely remains unknown. Field experiments were conducted at the Ayutthaya Rice Research Center, Ayutthaya, Thailand, in two consecutive rice-growing seasons (wet and dry) of 2016–2017 to evaluate the growth, yield and water productivity of irrigated lowland rice under different water and rice straw management practices. The treatments included were two water (continuous flooding [CF] and AWD) and three rice straw management practices (rice straw incorporation [RS-I], rice straw burning [RS-B] and without rice straw incorporation and burning [WRS-I + B]). AWD increased grain yield by 15% in the wet season and by 7% in the dry season compared with CF. Other yield components such as panicle number m–2, spikelet number panicle–1 and 1000-grain weight were also higher under AWD compared with CF depending on the growing season. AWD reduced total water input by 19% in the wet season and by 39% in the dry season resulting in an improvement in total water productivity by 46% in the wet season and by 77% in the dry season relative to CF. Rice straw application either as soil incorporation or open-field burning had no effect on grain yield, water-saving potential and water productivity of the tested variety regardless of the growing season. Although its positive role in supplying plant nutrients and maintaining soil fertility, rice straw incorporation in the field or burning should be discouraged due to negative environmental impacts. AWD (15 cm threshold water level below the soil surface for irrigation or with soil water potential of ≥ −20 kPa [AWD15]) is recommended for irrigated lowland rice cultivation from a point of view of reducing total water input without jeopardizing yield. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating the potential of Jember’s wetlands for ‘Lusi’ glutinous rice: Supporting food security amidst climate change,"This study evaluates the suitability of wetlands in Jember Regency for cultivating the flood-tolerant ‘Lusi’ glutinous rice variety, aimed at enhancing food security amidst climate change-induced flooding. Using geographical information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis, this research identifies land suitability classes and key limiting factors affecting the productivity of ‘Lusi’ rice. It addresses a critical knowledge gap on the adaptive potential of flood-tolerant rice varieties in wetland ecosystems, a topic that remains underexplored in Indonesia. The hypothesis posits that targeted interventions, such as soil pH adjustment and drainage enhancement, can optimize these wetlands for sustainable agriculture. The results indicate that 65.21% of the wetlands are moderately suitable (S2) but limited by suboptimal pH and drainage, while 24.64% are marginally suitable (S3) due to significant flooding and poor drainage.

"Policy perspectives on agricultural water management and associated technologies suitable for different agro-climatic zones of West Bengal, India","Agriculturally, West Bengal is one of the major productive states in India. It has made significant contributions to the gross state value added through agriculture and allied sectors, and water management is the most vital component to ensure stability and sustainability in agricultural production systems. There is increasing uncertainty in availability, or site-specific excess of water due to climate change. These call for strategic management of this important natural resource to achieve one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG No. 6) set by the United Nations, i.e. ensuring availability and sustainability in water management, and also providing sanitation to all by 2030. This eastern Indian state has six distinct agro-climatic zones (ACZs) based on its varied physiography, land, soil, weather, cropping pattern, vegetation and other characteristic features. Both water scarcity and water excess are intricately associated with the agricultural activities in the state, which demand integrated approach in the management of water resources and their efficient utilization. Here we elucidate the agricultural importance, distinctive features and constraints of six ACZs, provide an account of the water supply and demand, potential options to increase water-use efficiency, suitable technologies and zone-wise policy perspectives on water management in agriculture and allied sectors in West Bengal. © 2022, Current Science.

An Assessment Approach to Urban Economic Resilience of the Rust Belt in China,"Urban economic resilience provides a novel perspective on the sustainable development of urban and regional economy. Selecting 37 prefecture-level cities in the Northeast China that also known as the rust belt in China as a regional study sample that has experienced significant economic decline and out-migration in the last 20 years compared to many other regions in China, this study aims to construct an index system using the data collected in 2005, 2010, and 2016. This study evaluates urban economic resilience including five socioeconomic aspects: diversity, capabilities related to revenue and expenditure, innovation environment, trend of development, and openness. We analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of urban economic resilience, explore the key factors contributing to urban resilience and then provide decision-making suggestions to enhance it. We find the following: (1) urban economic resilience in the Northeast China has gradually increased over time, but spatial heterogeneity of resilience was prominent. Specifically, coastal cities were more economically resilient than inland cities. (2) Urban economic resilience in the Northeast China is significantly contributed by the diversity of an economic system and the trend of development, which contribute to resilience with weights of 0.214 and 0.216, respectively. The dominant factors contributing to urban economic resilience are different among diverse urban economic types and size. (3) To enhance urban economic resilience, comprehensive economic cities need to focus on increasing the diversity of economic structures. Resource-based and old industrial cities should focus on raising the innovation environment. Coastal cities should focus on increasing the diversity of their economic structures and creating positive trends of economic and social development. Agricultural cities should focus on creating positive trends of economic and social development. © 2021 Shan Man et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change and inclusive growth in Africa,"Africa’s pursuit of inclusive and sustainable economic growth is impeded by many challenges, including climate change, whose effect is most apparent in the continent’s tropical regions. To this end, this study investigates the impact of climate change on achieving pro-poor economic growth in Africa. Predicated on poverty-inequality-climate analysis, the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimator is used to analyse data from 1996 to 2020 covering 51 African countries. The results reveal that climate change significantly impedes inclusive growth. Furthermore, evidence of a long-lasting negative effect of climate change on inclusive growth, which could be attributed to a lack of coping mechanisms among the poor and vulnerable groups, is found. Finally, the findings show a marginal impact of institutional quality and government spending on inclusive growth in the face of climate change. The study recommends more climate mitigation efforts and enhanced adaptation mechanisms, especially for the poor, as they are most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. © 2023 The Author(s).

Climate-Induced Displacement and Migration – Implications on Poverty and Household Food Security in Southern Africa,"Climate-induced extreme weather events such as droughts and floods have been documented as major drivers of massive displacement and migration of people globally and in Southern Africa, in particular. To this end, floods and recurrent drought conditions in most countries in southern Africa (e.g. Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Eswatini) continue to induce rural–urban migration as people flee vulnerable areas (flood- & drought-prone areas) for perceived better opportunities in towns and cities, owing to persistent crop failure in rural areas. Against this background, this paper aims to contribute to the climate change and migration discourse by exploring the climate change, migration and development nexus to better understand the challenges and opportunities for rural development paused by climate change through the migration pathway. The study adopts a desktop review methodology and makes use of both scholarly and grey literature to unpack the climate change and migration linkages and how these present opportunities (and challenges) for rural development in Southern Africa. The review was conducted by searching electronic databases such as Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for articles published between 2000 and 2024. Key study findings reveal that climate change leads to population displacement and migration in Southern Africa as people flee flood and drought-prone rural areas for safer spaces (in towns and cities). This migration, while posing significant challenges for rural development and leading to the decline in rural food production, also presents potential opportunities for rural development through remittance flow and skills transfer. The study advocates for the formulation of policies and strategies that will mitigate the impacts of climate change while simultaneously harnessing the potential benefits of migration in promoting sustainable development in the region. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Effect of hydraulic retention time on wastewater treatment and microalgal growth at low light intensity,"Human activities have elevated ambient concentration of CO2 and water scarcity problem. Wastewater treatment integrated with microalgae production serves as a viable solution to the problems of energy intensive treatment processes and ambient CO2 hikes. In the present study, a lab scale revolving algal biofilm photobioreactor (RABP) was designed and used for treatment of synthetic municipal wastewater. Cotton rope was used as an attachment material for the attached growth of Tetradesmus obliquus in the RABP. The system was operated at HRTs of 2, 4 and 6 days, atmospheric CO2 and low light intensity of 25 μmol m−2 s−1. The performance of RABP was evaluated for treatment parameters, biomass production, CO2 biofixation and kinetic growth parameters including biofilm thickness (μm), biomass yield on light (g mol−1), specific growth rate (d−1) and doubling time. Treatment results revealed that removal rates for NH4 +-N, PO4 3−-P and COD were 19, 2.65 and 172.4 mg L−1 d−1 respectively at HRT of 2 days, which decreased with increase in HRT. The highest biomass production and biomass productivity of 4.638 g m−2 and 1.921 g m−2 d−1 was observed at 2 days HRT with its corresponding CO2 biofixation rate of 3.79 g m−2 d−1. Similarly, kinetic growth parameter results reflected the highest biomass to light ratio, biofilm thickness, specific growth rate and doubling time of 0.947 g mol−1, 3.830 μm, 5.797 d−1 and 0.11 days respectively at HRT of 2 days. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Impact of Toll Road to Agricultural Land Conversion for Sustainable Development: A Systematic Literature Review,"This study examined the relationship between the impact of toll road development on agricultural land conversion and the transformation of land along with its socioeconomic and environmental consequences. The method employed was a systematic literature review conducted using the PRISMA framework. The result identified eighteen publications discussing the impact of toll road construction on agricultural land conversion. The research concluded that toll road construction plays a role in converting areas into zones, settlements, and other non-agricultural purposes. This transformation can have effects on agricultural land conversion. The evaluation also highlights the importance of policy recommendations to mitigate the impacts of agricultural land conversion to sustainable development and food security, offering a hopeful outlook for the future. © 2024, ITB Journal Publisher.

Wealth-related inequalities in adoption of drought-tolerant maize and conservation agriculture in Zimbabwe,"This paper concerns Drought-Tolerant Maize (DTM) and Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices that were introduced into smallholder maize-based farming systems in Zimbabwe to enhance the productivity of maize and food security under a changing climate. Although these technologies are technically appropriate, there are difficulties with their use by smallholder farmers of relatively low socio-economic status, as measured through ownership of farm or household assets and endowments. Thus, we sought to quantify and explain wealth-related inequalities in the adoption of DTM and CA in smallholder farming communities and discuss their implications for food security. The analysis used cross-sectional household-level data gathered from 601 smallholder farmers from four districts in Zimbabwe. We found evidence of a pro-rich distribution of inequalities in the adoption of DTM and CA that were mostly explained by differences in household wealth, access to agricultural extension services and size of farm land. No meaningful differences in DTM adoption disparities were found across districts. Significant gender differences were observed for CA, and meaningful differences by district were noted. Results suggest the need for decision makers to consider implementing policies that focus on the poorer segments of the farming society to alleviate differences in the adoption of such agricultural technologies. For example, subsidizing the uptake of improved maize varieties including DTM and prioritizing equitable land distribution, coupled with specialised extension services for the poor in a cereal-based CA farming system, could reduce the observed gap between rich and poor in the uptake of these innovations and consequently improve food security. © 2019, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Rural–urban migration and its impact on environment and health: evidence from Cumilla City Corporation, Bangladesh","The key objective of this study is to analyze the determinants of migration in the study area with respect to push and pull factors. At the same time, this study also investigates the impact of migration on the environment and public health. A structural equation model has been applied based on primary data that was collected via a questionnaire and an interview survey. The push factors, such as financial problems, employment problems, concern about children's futures, extreme poverty, political causes, and landlessness, have a positive impact on migration. Pull factors such as better facilities, positive information, joint families, demographic factors, and higher income have a positive impact on migration. However, migration has a tremendous impact on environmental degradation and public health vulnerabilities. People should be aware of any planned migration and population distribution in relation to a city's resources and capabilities, as well as increased facilities in rural areas, such as health care facilities, education facilities, and information facilities that are better or equal to those in urban areas. Furthermore, this research contributes to social, political, environmental, and economic issues not only in the study area but also in Bangladesh.

Estimating the health production function for Pakistan: Do environmental factors matter?,"It is essential for sustainable economic development to comprehend how environmental factors impact public health. This study analyses this relationship in the context of Pakistan using long-term data. This study aims to determine how environmental factors influence health production function in Pakistan to enlighten policy decisions that can improve human life and advance the cause of sustainable development. We hypothesize, based on prior research, that urbanization and rainfall will increase life expectancy in Pakistan, while deforestation, temperature, and CO2 emissions will decrease it. To verify our theory, we use the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method to calculate the long-run association between the variables, as well as the Zivot–Andrews and Lee–Strazicich unit root tests to identify structural breaks. Utilizing the bound and Gregory–Hansen co-integration tests, co-integration is confirmed. According to ARDL estimates, there are statistically significant correlations between factors that affect Pakistan's life expectancy, such as deforestation, temperature, and CO2 emissions, as well as rainfall and urbanization. The findings of this study underscore the importance of addressing environmental degradation and deforestation in Pakistan. For enhancing human life and achieving sustainable development objectives in the nation, it is essential to modernize forest laws and regulations and adopt eco-friendly technologies. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Identification and certification of low indirect land use impact biomass for the eu bioeconomy,"The EU Bioeconomy is considered an ambitious concept aiming at to promote several targets related to environmental, social and economic sustainability. One of the main concerns and risks associated with the development of a growing bioeconomy in the EU is the increasing demand for land to support additional biomass production. This increasing demand might be associated with a number of negative impacts such as for example deforestation, the loss of natural habitats and ecosystem services. The EU H2020 project STAR-ProBio aims at the development of a comprehensive framework for the sustainability assessment of biobased products. As part of this framework development, we are analyzing potential strategies for the production of biomass associated with low indirect impacts and a low demand for land, respectively.

Perceptions of competing agendas in carbon neutrality policies in Portugal: Adverse impacts on vulnerable population groups,"The links between the political agendas of climate change, the energy transition, and energy poverty are multiple, complex, and overlapping. In line with European Union policy demands, Member States are implementing the various policies necessary to address these agendas, with an emergent focus on their synergistic potential. Successful implementation requires cooperation between multiple actors, yet little research exists on how diverse actors view the agendas. This limits the ability to account for diverse perspectives in carbon neutrality policy and related insights on trade-offs and competition points between the climate change, energy transition, and energy poverty agendas. We analyse perspectives on agenda interactions based on 39 expert interviews on Portuguese carbon neutrality agendas. Our case study results suggest strong agreement regarding theoretical linkages of the agendas but mixed views on whether this transpires in practice. These perceived inconsistencies reveal several unresolved competing agendas in Portuguese carbon neutrality policies. We also reveal important influences on citizen agency in the decarbonisation agendas. We argue these insights are valuable for current policy approaches, which promote decarbonisation policies that incorporate energy poverty and rely strongly on citizen participation. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Corona pandemic and plastic pollution: a way forward,"COVID-19 is a corona virus with high rate of human-to-human transmission and mortality. One major consequence of COVID-19 pandemic is the increased use of personal protective equipment (PPE), an essential component for the protection against COVID-19 and other transmissible diseases for healthcare workers and general population. Most of the PPE and biological wrapping materials are made of a petroleum-based polymer, which is non-biodegradable and leads to environmental pollution. This article discusses the preparation and characterisation of a completely biodegradable hybrid biopolymer, made of jute-cellulose derivative with oligo-chitosan. physico-mechanical, thermal, and degradable properties of cellulose-chitosan biopolymer (CCBP) were studied. The tensile strength of the CCBP is 45 MPa, soluble in normal water, and soapy water within seven days and three minutes. It degrades in soil with 2–3 months. This technology is aimed to lessen the environmental burden of plastic pollution through accumulation in landfills and air pollution through incineration.

Anzali Wetland Crisis: Unraveling the Decline of Iran's Ecological Gem,"The wetland loss rate in Iran is faster than the global average. Comprehending the shrinkage rate in Iranian wetlands and identifying the underlying drivers of these changes is essential for safeguarding their ecosystems' health and services. This study proposes a novel gray-box modeling framework to quantify the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the wetlands, by combining process-based and machine learning models. The developed model is utilized to project the Anzali coastal wetland shrinkage by simulating the complex interaction between the meteorological, hydrological, anthropogenic and sea water level characteristics, and the changes in wetland water surface area. Our framework aggregates Soil and Water Assessment Tool model, the 12 General Circulation Models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, Landsat imagery, and the Long Short-Term Memory model to project the shrinkage of the wetland till 2100. A comprehensive range of climate and Land Use/Cover change scenarios are analyzed. The results show that wetland will seasonally desiccate in 2058, mainly due to increasing air temperature, reduction in precipitation and inflow, excessive sediment loading to the wetland, and decline in the Caspian Sea level. For optimistic scenarios, where no changes in the Caspian Sea level is considered, the wetland will gradually diminish and become a seasonal waterbody by 2100. The outcomes of this study highlight that the Anzali wetland desiccation has profound implications for the regional-scale ecological balance, ecosystem health and function, public health, and local economy. Robust environmental interventions and sustainable development strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the detrimental impacts of climate and anthropogenic drivers on the wetland. © 2024.

"Modeling the linkage between climate change, CH4 emissions, and land use with Iran's livestock production: A food security perspective","The livestock production sector plays a crucial role in food security and income generation and has an undeniable relationship with the environment. Like other agricultural sectors, it faces the significant challenge of climate change. However, the attention given to this issue has not been satisfactory given its importance. Thus, the primary aim of the current research is to assess the impact of temperature change, precipitation, CH4 emissions, gross fixed capital, and land use on the livestock production index as an indicator of food security in Iran. The modeling uses data from 1990 to 2020, employing the NARDL approach and Granger causality. The results show that a 1% increase in temperature can lead to an 8.06% decrease in livestock production (food security), while a 1% decline in temperature results in a 3.85% surge in livestock production. Precipitation has a direct relationship with food security; a 1% rise and drop in rainfall lead to an increase and reduction in livestock production by 0.8% and 1.02%, respectively. A 1% increase in gross fixed capital boosts food security by 0.47%, while a 1% decrease leads to a 2.32% reduction. A statistically insignificant relationship is seen between the positive CH4 shock and food security in the long run. However, the negative shock of this variable positively influences food security by 7.5%. Negative changes in land use will reduce livestock production. The Granger causality test proves a two-way causal relationship between CH4 emissions and livestock production. A unidirectional causality is discovered from production to temperature and from land use to livestock production. To mitigate the impact of global warming on livestock production, strategic investments in infrastructure, livestock micro insurance, and informing producers about the consequences of climate change and solutions for addressing this phenomenon can be considered effective policies. © 2024 United Nations.",Not About Sufficiency
"Evaluation of quantitative and qualitative sustainability of aquifers by groundwater footprint methodology: case study: West Azerbaijan Province, Iran","In arid and semi-arid areas with limited surface water resources, the daily life and the growth of various economic sectors depend on the provision of services by the groundwater ecosystem. In many countries, groundwater is the main source of freshwater. In addition, groundwater plays an important role within the water cycle, and as such, it feeds and sustains groundwater-dependent ecosystems (such as rivers and wetlands). Therefore, sustainable management of groundwater resources is necessary. Groundwater footprint indicator is a useful tool for assessing the sustainable use of groundwater resources and its associated ecosystem services. In this paper, the sustainable use of groundwater in 28 main alluvial aquifer systems of West Azarbaijan province in the west of Lake Urmia-Northwest of Iran has been investigated by the groundwater footprint indicator. In order to assess the aquifers’ water quality sustainability for agricultural use, the integrated groundwater footprint indicator developed by Kourgialas et al. (2018)—based on GIS spatial analysis—has been used. This assessment can help water sector managers in adopting policies and measures to the sustainable management of the alluvial aquifer system. Due to the availability of sufficient data for all aquifers in 2011, the calculations were performed only for this year. The results showed that no aquifer has a sustainable use of groundwater resources. Also, 16 aquifers do not have qualitative sustainability due to salinity pollution. The results of implementing three applicable policy options to improve the quantitative and qualitative sustainability of aquifers showed that it is possible to change quantitative sustainability all aquifers, but improving qualitative sustainability is possible only in three aquifers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency

How do sources of carbon dioxide emissions affect life expectancy? Insights from 68 developing and emerging economies,"This study is possibly the first to investigate the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on life expectancy for 68 low- and middle-income countries for the 1990–2017 period. The analysis was carried out on a disaggregated basis on two dimensions: (1) the sources of CO2 emissions (i.e., consumption-based or production-based CO2 emissions) and (2) the level of economic development (i.e., developing or emerging) of countries. The results support the evidence of a negative association between life expectancy and CO2 emissions for the whole sample as well as for the group of emerging countries. This finding occurred irrespective of whether the CO2 emissions were consumption-based or production-based, suggesting that both consumption and production may reduce the life expectancy of the people in these groups of economies through the generation of harmful pollutants. In contrast, CO2 emissions, regardless of their sources, seem to improve the life expectancy of those in the group of developing countries in our study sample. In this regard, developing countries seem to be effectively importing emissions. Our findings suggest that the favorable impact of CO2 emissions on life expectancy is attributable to consumption rather than production. Furthermore, income growth alone cannot provide a solution for environmental degradation nor ensure a healthier life for the population. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the potential of harvesting rainfall runoff using pans to meet marigat’s water demand: An application of WEAP21 model,"Water resources are vital to basic livelihoods and economic growth. Marigat division in Baringo County, Kenya experiences water scarcity during the dry periods, a situation that is further aggravated by droughts and erratic rains. During the rainy seasons, a lot of water is lost as surface runoff, which can be harvested and stored in water reservoirs and used for domestic and livestock throughout the dry seasons. Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP21) system model was used to determine whether the water to be harvested from rainfall runoff was able to meet the Marigat community’s water demand. This was achieved by building creation of proposed new water pans scenario from the reference scenario. The results of the reference scenario were validated using observed river flows at Marigat Bridge station, and WEAP21 was also used to develop a water supply network. The results show that with the creation of proposed new water pans for harvesting surface runoff in areas facing water scarcity, the unmet domestic and livestock water demand is met up to 2020. © IWA Publishing 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
Effectiveness of agricultural water management technologies on rainfed cereals crop yield and runoff in semi-arid catchment: a meta-analysis,"Multiple agricultural water management (AWM) technologies are being promoted worldwide in rainfed agro-ecological production systems, such as the Limpopo River Basin, to close the yield gap, enhance food security and reduce poverty, but evidences on yield gains and environmental impacts are varied. This paper conducts a review of the performance of AWM technologies against conventional farmer practices to produce adequate evidence on cereal yield and field runoff changes. With the interrogation of literature from 1980 to 2013 using seven AWM groupings, enough evidence was found that AWM technologies can deliver substantial benefits of increased crop yield and water productivity with reduced environmental impacts. Using random effects model, the standardized mean difference (SMD) of yield between AWM and control was 0.27, while SMD of water productivity was 0.46, indicating the effectiveness of the technologies (SMD > 0). Subgroup analyses showed greatest yield responses on silty-clay-loam, clay-loam and sandy soils compared to clay and loam-sandy soils, and higher yield increase under low rainfall regime (200–500 mm) than under high rainfall regime (500–800 mm). Large yield change variations for different AWM technologies present a huge opportunity for meeting the existing yield gaps and enhancing coping capacity in dry years and under climate change. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Linking poverty levels to water resource use and conflicts in rural Tanzania,"Water scarcity is an important environmental constraint to development. Water availability is closely linked to human welfare and health by affecting nutrition status and quantity of drinking water especially for the poor. It has impacts on household labour because of the time and energy spent in obtaining it. These problems are more keenly felt among the poor households and in the agricultural subsistence economy. In many areas, the demand for water has been increasing due to rapid population growth, economic development, and climatic change. Water scarcity also stimulates social conflicts between various water users: individuals, communities, industries, livestock, wildlife, agriculture etc. Consequently, local communities have evolved strategies for coping with water stress and drought. These strategies include use of various sources of water, inaction to strict bye-laws regarding the use of water, crop diversification, wage labour, and possibly seasonal migration. The available strategies are likely to vary from one area to another. Some of these actions have measurable longterm demographic consequences, particularly if water stress is severe or repetitive. Although most governments and donor organizations often put much emphasis on the provision of water for drinking purposes, there is clear evidence that the supply of water for other uses has equal importance especially among rural communities. This observation suggests that putting too much emphasis on drinking water needs, addresses a rather insignificant part of the problem of water resources and biases the range of solutions which are likely to be proposed for perceived shortages. The presence of other water uses necessitates the provision of multi-purpose water sources that can serve a number of contrasting functions. This demand-responsive approach can enable the local communities and the poor households to choose the type of services they require on the basis of perceived needs and their ability to manage the water scheme. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

The “Chico Mendes” extractive reserve and land governance in the Amazon: Some lessons from the two last decades,"The discussions about sustainable development in the Amazon region, in particular the rubber tree social movement against deforestation and the struggle for land ownership, culminated in the implementation of conservation units for direct use, with the main reference being the “Chico Mendes” Extractive Reserve, located in Xapuri-Acre-Brazil, representing some kind of agrarian reform in the forest. The objective of the present work is to evaluate some of the lessons learned in the last two decades related to the guarantee of land ownership and the social reproduction of extractivists. The ASPF methodology of research project from the Federal University of Acre was used, based on social indicators such as schooling, access to land and housing time; economic indicators, such as economic efficiency and living standards in monetary terms; and environmental indicators such as land use and deforestation. The results indicate that housing turnover has decreased significantly in the analyzed period. However, for more than half of extractivists there is still no guarantee of land ownership. From the economic point of view, there was a significant reduction in both economic efficiency and the level of living among families. From the environmental point of view, there was a slight decrease in forests, with increased deforestation and increased pasture for cattle production.

A viewpoint,"This viewpoint paper argues for the need for more socially sustainable care systems that can better contribute to equitable utilization of health care in a post-pandemic era. Health care systems in developed nations need to rethink their role, particularly with regard to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) as well as becoming more sustainable societies. Socially sustainable care systems will recognize that systemic factors and processes (social, economic, environmental, cultural) need to be addressed simultaneously in order to achieve health equity. Moreover, these systems are likely to be of paramount importance for post-COVID-19, because of the potential increase in demand for health care due to forgone health care and the increased burden of chronic diseases as spillover effects related to COVID-19 miti-gation interventions. © the Author(s), 2020 Licensee PAGEPress, Italy.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate-Adaptive Nature-Based Regenerative Urban Green Streetscapes: Design Exploration from the City of Matera,"Over the past two decades, global cities have been addressing climate challenges by transforming their gray infrastructural spaces through climate-adaptive and nature-based regeneration processes. These efforts also aim to tackle local ecological, social, and economic disparities. Despite the prevailing focus on technical and performance-based approaches, research on climate-adaptive, nature-based regeneration of streetscapes remains limited and has yet to significantly influence design-driven approaches to urban regeneration. This paper seeks to address these gaps by emphasizing the importance of spatial dimensions in overcoming current theoretical and operational limitations. It introduces a research experience that aims to leverage the potential of design to promote climate-adaptive, nature-based green regeneration of streetscapes and to integrate this approach into mainstream practices through a “research-by-design” methodology. To achieve this, an operational framework has been developed and is presented here, offering both conceptual and practical insights for creating climate-adaptive, nature-based streetscapes. Following the proposed methodology, two pilot design cases are introduced and discussed, both located in the Italian city of Matera: Piccianello and La Martella. This iterative process aims to establish a framework for sustainable, long-term urban resilience, making cities greener, more adaptive, and more equitable. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Energy, Data, and Decision-Making: a Scoping Review—the 3D Commission","Access to energy is an important social determinant of health, and expanding the availability of affordable, clean energy is one of the Sustainable Development Goals. It has been argued that climate mitigation policies can, if well-designed in response to contextual factors, also achieve environmental, economic, and social progress, but otherwise pose risks to economic inequity generally and health inequity specifically. Decisions around such policies are hampered by data gaps, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and among vulnerable populations in high-income countries (HICs). The rise of “big data” offers the potential to address some of these gaps. This scoping review sought to explore the literature linking energy, big data, health, and decision-making. Literature searches in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were conducted. English language articles up to April 1, 2020, were included. Pre-agreed study characteristics including geographic location, data collected, and study design were extracted and presented descriptively, and a qualitative thematic analysis was performed on the articles using NVivo. Thirty-nine articles fulfilled eligibility criteria. These included a combination of review articles and research articles using primary or secondary data sources. The articles described health and economic effects of a wide range of energy types and uses, and attempted to model effects of a range of technological and policy innovations, in a variety of geographic contexts. Key themes identified in our analysis included the link between energy consumption and economic development, the role of inequality in understanding and predicting harms and benefits associated with energy production and use, the lack of available data on LMICs in general, and on the local contexts within them in particular. Examples of using “big data,” and areas in which the articles themselves described challenges with data limitations, were identified. The findings of this scoping review demonstrate the challenges decision-makers face in achieving energy efficiency gains and reducing emissions, while avoiding the exacerbation of existing inequities. Understanding how to maximize gains in energy efficiency and uptake of new technologies requires a deeper understanding of how work and life is shaped by socioeconomic inequalities between and within countries. This is particularly the case for LMICs and in local contexts where few data are currently available, and for whom existing evidence may not be directly applicable. Big data approaches may offer some value in tracking the uptake of new approaches, provide greater data granularity, and help compensate for evidence gaps in low resource settings. © 2021, The New York Academy of Medicine.",Not About Sufficiency
Hierarchically structured phytoglycogen aerogels for atmospheric water harvesting,"Water scarcity in arid regions is a challenge stimulating the need for the development of sustainable methods to harvest water vapor from the atmosphere. In this work, we developed an aerogel with a structural hierarchy for enhanced water capture and release. The aerogel was derived from nature-sourced biodegradable phytoglycogen nanoparticles (PhG NPs) that exhibit strong hydrogen bonding with water molecules. The crosslinking of acryloyl-modified PhG NPs produced microgel particles that were used as building blocks for a macroscopic hydrogel. The removal of water from this hydrogel yielded an aerogel with three characteristic pore dimensions, that is, several nanometer-, tens of nanometer-, and micrometer-size pores. The aerogel showed enhanced water-harvesting capacity and sorption kinetics. This hierarchically structured aerogel shows promise as an eco-friendly material for atmospheric water harvesting and offers a sustainable alternative to traditional sorbents. © 2025",Not About Sufficiency
Uneven heat burden in the sunshine state: Spatial patterns and socio-economic disparities of heat-related illness in Florida,"Climate change has increased the frequency and severity of extreme heat events globally, adversely affecting socio-economic conditions and public health. However, extreme heat has disparate effects on different population groups and the socio-economic determinants of its health effects are not well understood. In this study, we analyzed the spatial patterns of heat-related illness (HRI) visit rates at the zip-code level in Florida and applied statistical methods to examine the relationships between HRIs and environmental and socio-economic variables. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to evaluate the socio-economic effects on HRI visit rates under the same heat conditions. This is a two-step approach: we first included heat indicators in the baseline model and then added the socio-economic variables to assess their unique contributions in predicting HRI visits. Our findings indicate that temperature can only explain a small fraction of the variance in HRI cases (R2 = 0.04, p < 0.01), while socio-economic variables show stronger associations (R2 = 0.42, p < 0.01 in urban areas and R2 = 0.20, p < 0.01 in rural areas). Notably, marginalized and disadvantaged populations (e.g., individuals in poverty, those employed in construction, and those with disabilities) are positively associated with HRIs (p < 0.01). These findings highlight the disproportionate impacts of heat-related health issues on disadvantaged groups, calling for climate justice policy interventions. Additionally, a comparative analysis between rural and urban areas revealed different determinants of HRIs. Our study enhances the understanding of the socio-economic determinants and disparities of HRIs in Florida, providing actionable insights for policymakers and health agencies to prioritize emergency services and heat resilience planning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Distinguishing the relative contributions of climate and land use/cover changes to ecosystem services from a geospatial perspective,"Understanding impacts of land use/cover (LULC) and climate change ecosystem services (ESs) is critical to human well-being. However, existing studies seldom determined the relative contributions of LULC and climate change to ESs from a geospatial perspective, and the impacts of different LULC conversions on ESs remain unclear. This study established a framework for distinguishing the relative spatial contributions of climate and LULC change to water yield, net primary productivity (NPP) and soil retention and applied it to Zhejiang Province. The results showed that all ESs showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2020. Changes in water yield and soil retention were dominated by climate change, accounting for 75.22% and 77.69% of the total study area, respectively, while the changes in NPP were dominated by LULC changes, accounting for 82.70% of the total study area. We further quantified the impact of three major forms of LULC changes (urbanization, deforestation, and afforestation) on ESs in their respective regions. Deforestation and urbanization reduced NPP by 192 gC/m2 and 115.75 gC/m2, respectively, while afforestation increased NPP by 220.10 gC/m2. Afforestation reduced the water yield by 84.27%, while deforestation and urbanization increased it by 37.94% and 62.42%, respectively. Deforestation reduced soil retention by 38.28%, while urbanization and afforestation increased it by 3.91% and 63.28%, respectively. Five suggestions for improving ES management were proposed based on our results. This study can provide a detailed reference for decision-makers seeking sustainable ecosystem management strategies. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Seasonal responses of maize growth and water use to elevated CO2 based on a coupled device with climate chamber and weighing lysimeters,"The increase in atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations has been the most important environmental change experienced by agricultural systems. It is still uncertain whether grain yield of the global food crop of maize will remain unchanged under a future elevated CO2 (eCO2) environment. A coupled device with climate chamber and weighing lysimeters was developed to explore the water-related yield responses of maize to eCO2. Two experiments were conducted via this device under eCO2 (700 ppm) and current CO2 (400 ppm) concentrations. Seasonal changes in multiple growth indicators and related hydrological processes were compared between these two experiments. The results showed that the eCO2 effects were not significant on several indicators, i.e., the leaf carbon (C) content, nitrogen (N) content, chlorophyll content, C/N ratio, net photosynthesis rate, and leaf area index over the entire growing season (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, the transpiration rate (Tr) significantly reduced during the seedling to filling stages but notably increased at the maturity stage due to eCO2 (p < 0.05). Significant reduction in crop height (mean of 15.9%, p < 0.05) associated with notable increases in stem diameter (mean of 14.9%, p < 0.05) were found throughout the growing season. Dry matter per corncob at the final harvest decreased slightly under eCO2 (mean of 7.7 g, p > 0.05). Soil water storage was not significantly conserved by the decline of Tr except during the filling stage. Soil evaporation was likely promoted by eCO2 that the total evapotranspiration changed little (1.2%) over the entire growing season. Although the leaf water use efficiency increased significantly at every growth stage (mean of 27.3%, p < 0.05), the grain yield and water productivity were not improved noticeably by eCO2. This study could provide significant insight into predicting future crop yield and hydrological changes under climate change. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Multifunctional cellulose-based air filters with high loadings of metal–organic frameworks prepared by in situ growth method for gas adsorption and antibacterial applications,"Environmental threats, especially particulate matter, toxic gases and microbial pollution, have done serious harm to human health. In this paper, biodegradable composite filters were fabricated by an in situ deposition method to isolate pollutants and inactivate bacteria. The zeolitic imidazolate framework-8@cellulose fibers (ZIF-8@CF) filters had filtration efficiency as high as 98.36% and 99.94% against 0.3 μm and 0.5 μm particles, respectively, under a pressure drop of 134 Pa. Moreover, the nitrogen adsorption capacities of the composites were about 20 times higher than those of pure cellulose filters. In addition, the Ag-based metal–organic frameworks@cellulose fibers (Ag-MOFs@CF) exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli) with an inhibition zone diameter of 20.8 mm. Herein, these metal–organic frameworks@cellulose fibers (MOFs@CF) composite filters with high filtration efficiency, gas adsorption and antibacterial properties could be potentially applied in alleviating air pollution and in healthcare fields. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological footprint model based on improved BP network,"- The per capita ecological footprint (EF) is one of the most-widely recognized measures of environmental sustainability. It tries to quantify the earth's biological capacity required to support human activity.

"Impacts of urbanization on ecosystem services and their temporal relations: A case study in Northern Ningxia, China","Urbanization, an unavoidable global process, has driven land use change, impacted ecosystem services, and induced serious environmental problems. As a result, urban planning is a critical issue in sustainable development. In this study, we developed a framework to quantify how urbanization influences ecosystem services (ESs) in order to provide suggestions for urban planning during large scale urban agglomeration in northwestern China. We separated the region into three sub-regions (developed urban, developing urban, and rural areas), quantified five critical ESs (crop production, carbon storage, nutrient retention, sand fixation, and habitat quality), analyzed the relationships (trade-off, synergy, and bundle) among ES changes, and investigated the impacts of urbanization on these ESs. The results show that urbanization results in large scale reclamation and small scale deforestation in rural areas; it comprehensively results in an increase of four ESs (not habitat quality). Urban expansion mainly occurs in developing urban areas and causes a decrease in four ESs (not sand fixation). Based on temporal change in ESs, synergy relationships exist among them, except for between nutrient retention and crop production, which have an insignificant correlation. Urban expansion would strengthen the synergy relationships among regulating services, while green infrastructure in core urban areas would weaken these relationships. Based on the spatial distribution of ES change, two bundles were identified among the five ESs: 1) crop production, carbon storage, and nutrient retention; and 2) sand fixation and habitat quality. Based on these findings, several suggestions for urban expansion and land use planning are proposed to achieve an optimized balance between urbanization and ES protection. Investigating the impacts of rapid urbanization on ESs and their relationships could provide scientifically based suggestions for urban planning according to ES protection, sustainable urban development, and human well-being. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Agricultural technologies for climate change in developing countries: Policy options for innovation and technology diffusion,"Climate has obvious direct effects on agricultural production. The reverse is more apparent than ever as greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are tallied. The development and effective diffusion of new agricultural practices and technologies will largely shape how and how well farmers mitigate and adapt to climate change. This adaptation and mitigation potential is nowhere more pronounced than in developing countries where agricultural productivity remains low; poverty, vulnerability and food insecurity remain high; and the direct effects of climate change are expected to be especially harsh. Creating the necessary agricultural technologies and harnessing them to enable developing countries to adapt their agricultural systems to changing climate will require innovations in policy and institutions as well. Potential constraints to innovation involve both the private and public sectors in both developing and developed countries. The process of transferring agricultural innovations across agroecological and climatic zones is often subject to agronomic constraints. Often, the most binding constraints occur at the adoption stage, with several factors that potentially impede poor farmers' access to and use of new technologies. Based on discussions of these constraints, we derive six policy principles and use these principles to suggest several specific investments and policy priorities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Short-term effects of national-level natural resource rents on life expectancy: A cross-country panel data analysis,"While a substantial amount of literature addresses the relationship between natural resources and economic growth, relatively little is known regarding the relationship between natural resource endowment and health at the population level. We construct a 5-year cross-country panel to assess the impact of natural resource rents on changes in life expectancy at birth as a proxy indicator for population health during the period 1970–2015. To estimate the causal effects of interest, we use global commodity prices as instrumental variables for natural resource rent incomes in two-stage-least squares regressions. Controlling for country and year fixed effects, we show that each standard deviation increase in resource rents results in life expectancy increase of 6.72% (CI: 2.01%, 11.44%). This corresponds to approximately one additional year of life expectancy gained over five years. We find a larger positive effect of rents on life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) compared to other world regions. We do not find short-term effects of rents on economic growth, but show that increases in resource rents result in sizeable increases in government revenues in the short run, which likely translate into increased spending across government sectors. This suggests that natural resources can help governments finance health and other development-oriented programs needed to improve population health. © 2021 Lyatuu et al.

Scenarios for adaptation and mitigation in urban Africa under 1.5 °C global warming,"Cities are considered to be at the frontline of the global climate change response, both from mitigation and adaptation perspectives. But many cities are engulfed in infrastructure deficits, carbon intensive development while urban poverty adds to this complexity in Africa. Africa's rapid urbanisation is coming with opportunities and challenges but the contribution of this urbanization to limit global warming at 1.5 degrees requires new knowledge on the interactions between adaptation and mitigation. Climate impacts on African cities are growing, with spatially differentiated warming of between 0.3 and 0.7 degrees. Rainfall redistribution and excessive rainstorms have impacted African cities in various ways. Many of the African cities are, however responding to the challenges through the formulation of adaptation plans, mitigation strategies with a strong focus on resilience and sustainable development — as outlined in the African Union's Agenda 2063. Given that most cities in Africa are low emitting cities, this paper discusses how adaptation and mitigation can be coupled using three scenarios in the context of 1.5-degree warming. It is also recognized that the different ecologies of Africa offer multiple possible pathways of adaptation and mitigation for increased African urban resilience. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards sustainability: The spatiotemporal patterns and influence mechanism of urban sprawl intensity in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration,"Urban sprawl has been a great challenge to current sustainable development goals, especially in urban agglomeration areas. Based on the nighttime light and WorldPop population grid data from 2011 to 2020, this study established a multidimensional evaluation system of urban sprawl intensity in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA) with a “scale-density-structure” framework. The Dagum Gini coefficient, spatial Markov chain, and econometric analysis were applied to analyze urban sprawl intensity. The results suggested that: (1) the urban sprawl intensities of the cities in the YRDUA became more imbalanced over the decade; (2) the mild sprawl cities were dominant in the study area, but the moderate and severe sprawl cities were mostly located in the west and the only inland province–Anhui; (3) the spatial distribution of urban sprawl intensity indicated “club convergence” and strong spatial correlation effect, but poor stability; and (4) land resource mismatch and population urbanization were the main explanatory variables for urban sprawl intensity, with large cities more sensitive to the former, and medium cities to the latter. These findings can provide important policy implications to sustainable development and compact growth. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Top 10 public health challenges to track in 2023: Shifting focus beyond a global pandemic,"The year 2022 saw COVID-19 as the primary public health concern, with vaccine rollout and mandates at the forefront. Other viral infectious diseases, such as Monkeypox and Ebola, emerged as public health concerns. Climate change and political conflicts significantly impacted global health, increasing the demand for humanitarian assistance and protection. In 2023, it remains crucial to identify global and public health priority areas to coordinate and implement effective solutions. Through discussions with public health practitioners and researchers, we have identified key priority areas for 2023, namely, health systems, the mental health crisis, substance abuse, infectious diseases, malnutrition and food insecurity, sexual and reproductive health challenges, environmental pollution, the climate crisis, cancer, and diabetes. These priority areas highlight shared concerns that should be addressed to facilitate proactive and innovative health interventions and practices. To achieve universal healthcare targets for 2030, prioritization, financial investment, international cooperation, and collaboration in addressing these global health challenges are crucial. This requires coordination among public health decision-makers, the private health sector, and opinion leaders to implement country-specific healthcare financing and food security measures. Research, scientific knowledge, and technical capacities must be leveraged to produce sustainable interventions that effectively reduce health disparities and improve health system responsiveness to prevent these challenges from progressing to public health emergencies. © 2023 The Authors.

"Unlocking food security and livelihoods: the transformative power of agroecology among vulnerable smallholder farmers in Kembata Tembaro, Ethiopia","This article explores the transformative potential of an agroecological project in addressing challenges faced by vulnerable smallholder farmers in Kembata Tembaro, Ethiopia. Four key indicators of farmers’ food security–enset stock, land sharing, agricultural biodiversity, and fodder production–were assessed before and after the project implementation. The findings reveal that the agroecological transition initiated by the project positively impacted all indicators, with longer-term beneficiaries experiencing more significant improvements. The transition resulted in breaking the vicious circle of food insecurity and in establishing a virtuous circle of improved livelihoods and resilience through enhanced productivity, reintroduction of livestock, and the production and marketing of fodder into local markets. The study also highlights the crucial role of traditional indigenous organizations, in identifying context-specific needs and in creating and sharing knowledge for successful agroecological transitions. Millions of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia are trapped in a vicious circle of food insecurity and vulnerability due to soil degradation, high population density, and depletion of natural resources. This research serves as a compelling call to prioritize and invest in agroecology as a key solution to sustainably intensify smallholder agriculture, conserve natural resources, protect biodiversity, and improve the livelihoods of vulnerable farmers in similar contexts. © 2023 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).",Not About Sufficiency
"Resilience Measurements and Dynamics of Resource-Based Cities in Heilongjiang Province, China","In the process of sustainable transformation, resource-based cities (RBCs) in Heilongjiang are in a dilemma. Resilience is a key capability to help RBCs deepen sustainable development, adapt to shocks, and exit the transformation dilemma. This study aims to clarify the resilience measurements and dynamics of RBCs and propose targeted resilience enhancement strategies. First, we construct a resilience indicator system based on the urban complex adaptive system (CAS) and use principal component analysis (PCA) to specify indicator weights to obtain the resilience values of RBCs in Heilongjiang Province during 2010–2019, then use cluster analysis to classify five resilience grades. Second, we identify and analyze the resilience dynamics of RBCs in Heilongjiang Province from 2010–2019 based on the adaptive cycle framework. The results indicate that the overall resilience dynamics of RBCs have exhibited an upward trend over the past decade, but there are clear variations in the level of resilience values and dynamics between the different types of RBCs. The petroleum-based city has the highest level of resilience, is less affected by shocks, and recovers quickly. Forest-based cities have a medium level of resilience and are able to recover from shocks, but they fail to improve and remain at a medium level for a long time. Coal-based cities have a low level of resilience and find it difficult to recover from shocks, but this has improved since 2017. Finally, we propose targeted resilience enhancement strategies for RBCs of different types and resilience levels in Heilongjiang Province to provide RBCs with directional guidance for overcoming the development dilemma through resilience measures. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Atmospheric CO2 fertilization effect on cereal yields in Morocco using the CARAIB dynamic vegetation model,"Climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 levels are critical factors influencing agricultural productivity, particularly in Morocco, where cereal crops are essential for food security. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the combined effects of atmospheric CO2 variations and climatic changes on cereal yields up to 2099 using the CARAIB dynamic vegetation model. This evaluation is driven by four future scenarios based on the Euro-CORDEX initiative's regional climate models under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. As part of this evaluation, the study also validates the CARAIB model for Morocco's major cereal crops: soft wheat, durum wheat, and barley, in order to ensure the model's accuracy in simulating crop responses under projected environmental conditions. The CARAIB model effectively simulated historical cereal yield trajectories across major farming regions in Morocco from 2000 to 2016, demonstrating its robust predictive capability. Our future projections suggest that elevated CO2 levels might initially sustain cereal yields at approximately 90 % of current levels until 2050. This trend indicates that the increase in atmospheric CO2 may exert a moderating influence on the negative impacts of other environmental stressors on crop yields. However, despite this initial buffering effect, the overall yield trend from the present until 2099 indicates a decrease for most combinations of crop, zone, and climate model, even with the CO2 fertilization effect, except in some cases, the model exhibits slight increases or stabilization in yields. Additionally, the CARAIB model predicts potential yield shocks of 10–35 % below current levels from the 2080 s onwards, primarily due to periodic droughts. This variation underscores the complexity of the interplay between CO2 fertilization and climatic changes, emphasizing the urgent need for Morocco to develop adaptive agricultural strategies for long-term sustainability in the face of climatic challenges. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of the spatial dynamics and interactions among multiple ecosystem services to promote effective policy making across Mediterranean island landscapes,"To manage multiple ecosystem services (ES) effectively, it is essential to understand how the dynamics of ES maintain healthy ecosystems to avoid potential negative impacts on human well-being in the context of sustainable development. In particular, the Ionian Islands in the central Mediterranean are characterized by high natural, ecological, and recreational value; however, the intensification of human activities over time has resulted in the loss of natural ecosystems, which might have negatively impacted ES. Here, we aimed to assess and understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of ES supply and how these components interact across the Ionian Islands to optimize future ES provision and mitigate current trade-offs. We quantified multiple ecosystem services and analyzed their interactions at a temporal scale across the four prefectures of the Ionian Islands. Seven ES were quantified covering all three ES sections (provisioning, regulating and maintenance, and cultural) of the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES). ES interactions were investigated by analyzing ES relationships, identifying ES bundles (sets of ES that repeatedly occur together across space and time), and specifying ES occurrence within bundles. The three ES groups exhibited similar patterns on some islands, but differed on islands with areas of high recreation in parallel to low provisioning and regulating ES. Temporal variations showed both stability and changes to the supply of ES, as well as in the interactions among them. Different patterns among the islands were caused by the degree of mixing between natural vegetation and olive orchards. This study identified seven ES bundles that had distinct compositions and magnitudes, with both unique and common bundles being found among the islands. The olive grove bundle delivered the most ES, while the non-vegetated bundle delivered negligible amounts of ES. Spatial and temporal variation in ES appear to be determined by agriculture, land abandonment, and increasing tourism, as well as the occurrence of fires. Knowledge about the spatial dynamics and interactions among ES could provide information for stakeholders and decision-making processes to develop appropriate sustainable management of the ecosystems on the Ionian Islands to secure ecological, social, and economic resilience. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy sufficiency through social innovation in housing,"Experience shows that energy savings through energy efficiency measures are partly compensated by income growth, and partly by rebound effects. Therefore to be effective, efficiency measures have to be embedded in a concept of sufficiency which strives for limits and absolute reduction of energy consumption. While the sufficiency concept is not new, it only recently gained attention in the field of housing. This paper provides a basis for broader and more informed debates in policy and research on the potential of sufficiency considerations to contribute to the overall reduction of energy consumption in the residential sector. It recommends shifting the attention from energy consumption of buildings towards a concept of sustainable homes in which e.g. the size of the living area plays a crucial role. A further important aspect is the possibility to fulfil other basic needs like the provision with food, recreation and social contacts in the nearby environment. The paper describes first examples of housing projects guided by sufficiency criteria, depicts the potential roles of different actor groups and points towards some general policy recommendations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Eco-efficiency and effectiveness evaluation toward sustainable urban development in China: a super-efficiency SBM–DEA with undesirable outputs,"Eco-efficiency, especially the total-factor eco-efficiency, measured by DEA models considering undesirable outputs, has been a popular instrument to evaluate sustainable development in recent years. However, sustainable development pursues not only high eco-efficiency which ensures that the utilization of natural resource and environment is in a sustainable way, but also good effectiveness which ensures that the development is in the right direction. In this paper, firstly, the efficiency of sustainable urban development is measured, i.e., measuring the eco-efficiency of 35 major cities in China during the period of 2011–2015 based on a super-efficiency SBM–DEA model with undesirable outputs and the Malmquist–Luenberger index is used to explore the dynamic change of eco-efficiency. Secondly, the effectiveness of urban development is measured by overall well-being including urban HDI and life satisfaction. Thirdly, a comprehensive analysis based on efficiency and effectiveness is conducted to evaluate sustainable urban development. The results indicate that: (1) the overall efficiency of 35 major cities in China as a whole is at a low level during the 12th five-year plan period, and the improvement of total-factor ecological productivity is mainly enhanced by technological progress. (2) With regarding to the effectiveness of urban development, Hangzhou, Jinan, Ningbo, Xiamen and Qingdao rank top five, while the cities with a high level of urban HDI like Guangzhou, Changsha and Beijing only rank in the middle due to a relatively low level of life satisfaction. (3) Based on efficiency and effectiveness, most of the cities perform with a low-level efficiency or poor effectiveness, only four cities including Qingdao, Changchun, Ningbo and Tianjin perform with a relatively high efficiency and good effectiveness. Finally, some implications and policy suggestions are proposed based on the above findings. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency

Spatial patterns of the diurnal variations of PM2.5 and their influencing factors across China,"Air pollution, particularly PM2.5, is a significant public health concern in China and worldwide. The diurnal fluctuation feature of PM2.5 is a crucial factor influencing human exposure, but research on its spatiotemporal characteristics across China is limited. This study aims to explore the spatial patterns of diurnal variations in PM2.5 concentrations across China and identify the factors that influence them. We conducted a comprehensive study to investigate the diurnal range of PM2.5 concentration and meteorological factors from 1636 fixed monitoring sites in China from January 2015 to December 2021. We calculated the average diurnal variation of PM2.5 during different seasons at each site and explored the correlation between the diurnal variation of PM2.5 and various types of factors. The main influencing factors was identified by employing eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our spatial analysis revealed significant variations in both the mean concentration and diurnal range of PM2.5 across different regions in China. The main factors affecting the diurnal variation of PM2.5 include topographic factors such as elevation, meteorological factors such as temperature, air pressure, and dew point temperature, and socioeconomic factors such as industry and transportation. This study is beneficial for evidence-based policy decisions aimed at reducing air pollution and protecting public health. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable Practices and Performance of Resource-Based Companies: The Role of Internal Control,"As the concept of sustainable resource usage gains popularity, resource-based companies are faced with the challenge of reconciling environmental responsibility with corporate performance to achieve the “coexistence” of environmental and economic benefits. We take data related to RBCs for 2010–2020 and perform a multiple regression analysis of the data. This study focuses on the role of internal control in analyzing the impact of resource-based companies (RBCs) on corporate financial performance (CFP) while assuming corporate environmental responsibility (CER). The findings reveal that the fulfillment of CER by RBCs positively impacts CFP. We then add a moderating test to observe the role of internal controls in the relationship between the two. The results show that the positive effect of CER on CFP is greater with stronger internal control measures. In addition, we introduce heterogeneity analysis to analyze the effect of firm ownership. The moderating effect is diminished in privately owned companies.

This study centers on Hubei Province, which is an important water conservation area in the Yangtze River Basin and is one of the core water source areas for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, and evaluates the water resource carrying capacity of the three major urban agglomerations in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2020 based on the four dimensions of water resources, economics, society, and ecology, using the entropy weighting method and the TOPSIS model to construct an evaluation index system. We then employ the kernel density estimation method, ArcGIS visualization, and the Dagum Gini coefficient method to perform a comprehensive analysis of spatial and temporal differences, dynamic evolution, and contribution sources. The results show that (1) the water resource carrying capacity of Hubei Province as a whole increased from a severe overload to overload level during the study period. The water resource carrying capacity of the three major urban agglomerations shows a regional distribution pattern where the Yi-Jing-Jing-En agglomeration’s capacity surpasses that of the Wuhan urban agglomeration, which is bigger than Xiang-Shi-Sui-Shen urban agglomeration. A lower ecological water use rate primarily constrains the enhancement of the carrying capacity of water resources in Hubei Province. (2) The kernel density estimation reveals an increase in the overall water resource carrying capacity across Hubei Province’s three major urban agglomerations during the study period, alongside a pronounced trend towards polarization. (3) While the overall Gini coefficient, indicating an imbalance in water resource carrying capacity in Hubei Province, remains high, it demonstrates a declining trend, suggesting a growing disparity in water resource carrying capacity across the province’s three major urban agglomerations. Hubei Province’s water resource carrying capacity faces challenges of an overall imbalance and localized vulnerability. Strategies should aim to enhance synergy, address these deficiencies directly, and devise targeted measures tailored to the distinct features of various urban clusters. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Trade heterogeneity and virtual water exports of China,"China is facing serious water scarcity, and the effects of international trade on its water resources have been widely examined. Processing exports account for nearly half of China’s gross exports. Adopting China’s multi-regional input–output table that captures processing exports, we enrich the literature on virtual water exports by accounting for trade heterogeneity. The results show that China’s virtual water exports show a significant trade heterogeneity. Normal and processing exports are attributed to 86.7% and 13.3% of the Agriculture sector’s water use induced by exports respectively. Conversely, normal and processing exports are attributed to 31.8% and 68.3% of the Communications Equipment, Computers sector’s water use induced by exports respectively. In addition, a cross-regional compensation is needed to deal with the unequal regional distribution of water uses and economic benefits related to exports. © 2022 The International Input-Output Association.",Not About Sufficiency
Benefit Modeling and Analysis of Wind Power Generation under Social Energy Economy and Public Health,"Wind is a renewable energy source. Overall, using wind to produce energy has fewer effects on the environment than many other energy sources. Wind and solar energy provide public health and environmental benefits to the social. Wind turbines may also reduce the amount of electricity generation from fossil fuels, which results in lower total air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. In order to better optimize the effect of social energy economic management and facilitate the multiobjective decision making of coordinated development of energy and socioeconomic environment, a modeling and analysis method of economic benefits of wind power generation based on deep learning is proposed. In this paper, based on the principle of deep learning, the evaluation indicators of wind power economic benefits are excavated, a scientific and reasonable economic benefit evaluation system is constructed, a wind power economic benefit analysis model supported by public management is constructed, and the steps of wind power economic benefit analysis are simplified. It is concluded that the modeling and analysis method of wind power economic benefits based on deep learning has high practicability in the actual application process, which is convenient for the prediction and analysis of energy demand for social and economic development. © 2022 Ying Liu et al.",Not About Sufficiency
"Spatial optimization of cropping pattern in the upper-middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, Northwest China","Agriculture has by far the largest water footprint of human activities. Improving the water productivity of crop production is key to enhancing both water and food security. Irrigation is a significant pressure on water resources in the arid region of Northwest China. Here, we examine optimizing the regional cropping distribution within the Heihe River basin for achieving the dual goals of improving productivity and reducing irrigation water demand. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and a cellular automata model are employed to model the processes of cropping pattern changes. The optimization takes the maximum of crop water productivity (CWP), the maximum economic water productivity (EWP) and the maximum nutrient water productivity (NWP) as the objective function. The model optimizes the spatial distribution of six crops including corn, spring wheat, spring barley, spring canola-Polish, alfalfa and upland cotton. Results show that under the premise of considering food security, the maximization of water productivity for CWP, EWP, and NWP, leads to the reduction of corn planting area and the eastward shift of corn planting region. A significant decrease in the proportion of wheat planting occurs in the objective of EWP maximization, while the planting proportion of barley and canola increased significantly. All three optimization objectives yield cropping distributions that reduce the irrigation water demand of cultivated land and improve the water productivity of the basin, among which maximizing CWP scenario has the greatest water-saving intensity. Furthermore, from the perspective of ecosystem services, the cropping distribution of maximizing EWP is more reasonable for the basin. Different cropping change scenarios provide effective references for decision makers to make a reasonable cropping distribution in the region. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Interpretation of IPCC AR6: climate change and water security,"Water security is the centrality in adapting and mitigating climate change. It is also critical in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), Working Group II established Chapter 4 of “Water”. This Chapter assesses observed and projected climate-induced changes in the water cycle, their current impacts and future risks on human and natural systems. This chapter also assesses the current and future water scarcity risks, the benefits and effectiveness of water-related adaptations. The assessment results show that human-induced climate change has led to an accelerated global hydrological cycle, thereby affecting water security and exacerbating water-related vulnerabilities. Water-related risks are projected to increase with every degree of global warming, especially in more vulnerable and exposed regions. Limiting global warming to 1.5℃ would effectively reduce future water-related risks, and contribute to meet the triple goals of water security, sustainable and climate-resilient development. China is experiencing high water security risks, and has a grand societal demand on scientific and technological advancements in water security. In future, water security research needs to emphasize the ecological and hydrological effects of gray and green infrastructure, three-dimensional water scarcity assessment, water-food-energy nexus, and the development and application of Earth System Simulators. atechange.c © 2022 by the Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Assessment of lexicographic minimax allocations of blue and green water footprints in the yangtze river economic belt based on land, population, and economy","To assess different impacts of land, population and economy factors on the lexicographic minimax optimal allocation of blue and green water footprints, a comprehensive discriminant rule is constructed in this paper based on the Gini coefficient and Theil entropy index. The proposed rule is employed to estimate the influence of the aforesaid factors (land, population and economy) on the corresponding allocation schemes from a fairness perspective. To demonstrate its applicability, the proposed approach is applied to a water resources allocation study for 11 provinces in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). The results indicate that: (1) the economy-based lexicographic allocation of water footprints (LAWF) is more equalitarian for the provinces with high water footprint quotas. The land area-based LAWF is more equalitarian for the provinces with low water footprint quotas. The population-based LAWF is more equalitarian for the provinces with medium water footprint quotas. (2) The contribution of intra-regional variation in the population-based LAWF scheme is the largest of the three schemes. The inter-regional variation contributed the largest in the land area-based LAWF scheme. (3) Two synthetic schemes which integrate multiple factors among land area, economy and population are more equalitarian than the three single-factor schemes. Compared with the original situation which is an equalitarian but ineffective allocation, the two synthetic schemes have greater effect on the improvement of the supply-demand balance of water resources carrying capacity. Therefore, the defect of the population, economy and land area factors acting alone should be resolved by designing a weighting system, in order to optimize the allocation of water resources. © 2019 by the authors.

The Water-Energy Nexus of Megacities Extends Beyond Geographic Boundaries: A Case of Beijing,"The water-energy nexus (WEN) is dynamic and complicated in megacities, most of which are challenged by water scarcity and the mandate to reduce energy consumption. A salient feature of water and energy services in megacities is that they are supported by a web of regional infrastructure, extending far beyond the geographic boundaries of the cities, resulting in a strong dependence on resources imported from outside. Understanding the WEN of megacities has implications not only for more efficient resource utilization but also for synergistic regional development and corporation. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the WEN of Beijing within and beyond its geographic boundaries. Results show that water for local internal energy production and transformation accounts for 220 million m3/year, or 5.6% of its total freshwater use in 2016, and the energy for local water abstraction, supply, and treatment is 3.06 billion kWh, accounting for 1.1% of its total energy consumption for the same year. The external water for ""imported"" energy is 290 million m3/year, 1.3 times of Beijing's freshwater use for internal energy. This means that more water for energy is consumed outside Beijing than that within Beijing. The energy for external water is negligible because the bulk of the water transfer into Beijing relies on gravity and because the energy for construction of the transfer infrastructure is not included. Analysis of the WEN revealed the contradiction between the two independently conceived policies of Beijing: to meet the ""three-red-line"" target in the water sector, recycled water and transferred water use will rise, making it more difficult to meet the carbon emission control targets. Therefore, adopting low energy intensity, nature-based water recycling is a wise policy choice. Copyright © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Major emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China: A matter of global health and socioeconomic development for 1.3 billion,"Emerging and re-emerging zoonoses are a significant public health concern and cause considerable socioeconomic problems globally. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, avian influenza H7N9, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and the re-emergence of rabies, brucellosis, and other zoonoses have had a significant effect on the national economy and public health in China, and have affected other countries. Contributing factors that continue to affect emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in China include social and environmental factors and microbial evolution, such as population growth, urbanization, deforestation, livestock production, food safety, climate change, and pathogen mutation. The Chinese government has devised new strategies and has taken measures to deal with the challenges of these diseases, including the issuing of laws and regulations, establishment of disease reporting systems, implementation of special projects for major infectious diseases, interdisciplinary and international cooperation, exotic disease surveillance, and health education. These strategies and measures can serve as models for the surveillance and response to continuing threats from emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in other countries. © 2014 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Urban metabolism process based on emergy synthesis: Theory and method,"As the center of human activities and social civilization, city has developed at the cost of serious environmental degradation and huge eco-environmental pressure, which further lower the human living standard and impeded the sustainable development of the urban ecosystem. Current urban metabolic methods have broader views and focus more on ecological aspects - impact of emissions and resource consumption - but they lack a rigorous thermodynamic framework. Consequently, there is a need for modifying existing processes and developing new technologies that minimize environmental impact while providing stimulating ecological flow. This study developed an emergy-based framework for evaluating ecological objectives in traditional urban metabolic process. It started with a brief historical review of urban sustainable development and examines the controversial concept critically from a thermodynamic point of view. Then the assessment framework was proposed by reviewing and compiling existing data and studies on environmental issues available primarily at some sources, which includes resource accounting and environmental impact assessment. The direct and indirect emergy demand was assessed and quantied based on airborne/waterborne pollutants dilution patterns, and concepts of Life Cycle Impact Assessment. Such a framework is a necessary pre-requisite to perform a reliable cost-benefit evaluation of urban sustainability strategies, and provide guidance to policy decisions.",Not About Sufficiency
"Environmental poverty, a decomposed environmental Kuznets curve, and alternatives: Sustainability lessons from China","Amid increasing recognition of the importance of the environmental factor in understanding poverty and development, this article coins the term ""environmental poverty"" to refer to the lack of the healthy environment needed for society's survival and development as a direct result of human-induced environmental degradation. A decomposed environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) demonstrates that places (such as countries, counties, or cities) following the ""grow first, clean up later"" approach (or the first half of the EKC) may obtain economic gains accompanied by extreme environmental sacrifice, excessive social injustice, and income and environmental inequalities. The same place may include communities whose curves differ in shape. Some communities may prosper at the expense of other communities, which may fall into environmental poverty and eventually irreversible environmental degradation and economic failure. Places following alternatives or ""flat EKCs"" may be slow in getting out of economic poverty, but enjoy a healthier environment, equality in income and environmental quality, and social justice. Countries, especially developing countries, should aspire to sustainable alternatives. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental impacts of electricity sector in Taiwan by using input-output life cycle assessment: The role of carbon dioxide emissions,"Electricity has played a critical role in supporting industrial development and economic growth in Taiwan. In this study, input-output analysis is combined with life cycle assessment to evaluate the total environmental impacts (including direct and indirect) of the electricity sector in Taiwan. The results indicate that the environmental impacts of Taiwan's electricity sector increased from 2001 to 2006, and 85% of these are focused on eight related sectors. In addition, ""human health"" suffers from the most significant environmental impact, followed by ""resources"", ""climate change"" and ""ecosystem quality"". Although direct environmental impacts are significant, especially with regard to climate change, indirect environmental impacts are gradually increasing. Because the electricity sector is linked to many other sectors, there would be an underestimation of CO2 emissions and other environmental impacts if the indirect effects from the related sectors were omitted from the calculations. These indirect impacts mainly come from the ""non-metallic minerals"", ""petroleum refining products"" and ""other metals"" sectors, and the technology used in these three sectors needs to improve and become more environmentally-friendly. Other suggestions to promote the sustainable development of Taiwan's electricity sector include upgrading energy efficiency, implementing stricter effluent regulatory standards, maximizing energy security with a higher proportion of renewable energy sources, phasing out old fossil fuel plant facilities, seeking international cooperation for CCS technology, and promoting energy-saving by providing economic incentives. This study is of value to the government and relevant industries that are working to identify the total environmental impacts of their energy policies, and to plan mitigation strategies and policy implementations to reduce CO2 emissions and control pollution. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.",Not About Sufficiency
Drops for crops: Modelling crop water productivity on a global scale,"There is an emerging need to support water and food policy and decision making at the global and national levels. A systematic tool that is capable of analyzing water-food relationships with high spatial resolutions would be very useful. A GEPIC model has recently been developed by integrating a crop growth model with a Geographic Information System (GIS). The GEPIC model was applied to simulate crop yield and crop water productivity (CWP) for maize at a spatial resolution of 30 arc-minutes on a global scale. A comparison between simulated yields and FAO statistical yields in 124 countries shows a good agreement. The simulated CWP values are mainly in line with the measured values reported in literature. The crop yield and CWP were simulated with the assumption of sufficient water and fertilizer supply, holding other factors unchanged. The simulation results show that many countries have the potentials in achieving high maize yields and CWP. More than 80% of African countries have the potential to double their CWP. This reflects the current poor water and fertilizer management there. The results imply that efforts have to be strengthened to improve water and fertilizer management should the malnutrition be reduced or even eliminated. © 2008 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

Climate change and food security in Caribbean small island developing states: challenges and strategies,"Caribbean small island developing states (SIDS) are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Food security is a key issue in the region, and is related to vulnerability in the natural and human system. This short research paper, which reports on a systematic search of the academic literature and is part of a larger research project on climate change adaptation in Caribbean coastal communities, investigates two central questions: (1) what challenges to food security are Caribbean SIDS facing due to climate change? and (2) what strategies, if any, are being used to adapt to these challenges? We review peer-reviewed articles published after the release of Working Group II’s contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2014, which included a chapter on vulnerability and impacts in small islands (Chapter 29). We find that post AR5 articles confirm that climate change will have a significant effect on agriculture and fisheries in the Caribbean, mainly through changing patterns of weather, air and sea surface temperatures, and water availability. These studies highlight the importance of considering the social dimensions of food security in the region when identifying and implementing adaptation strategies, particularly in the context of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. These social dimensions include the Caribbean’s historical and social context as well as its demographics, which feature varying population densities and poverty rates. They serve to increase vulnerability but are imperative considerations for understanding and minimizing the threat climate change poses to food security in the region. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
The flood risk information used in spatial policy-based design for socio-economic integration of the most vulnerable persons from rural agglomerations. study case Romania,"In the context of looking for spatial integrated complex solutions (OECD 2006) regarding the poverty alleviation and social cohesion needs increasing in rural reas, we suggest a conceptual and analytical framework based on risk identification. The risk identification is in line with Domokos et al., (2015), concerning the research question: ""Which are the factors that need to be present and appropriately applied for the process to be adequately managed?"" The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) 2015- 2030, was adopted by the Member States of the United Nations in 2015. Safaie et al., (2017) in support to SFDRR, states that using risk information in policy design is still a challenge. SFDRR put disaster risk on the priority for action: ""understanding disaster risk in all its dimensions of vulnerability, capacity, exposure of persons and assets, hazard characteristics and the environment."" Bhatta (2008) describes the demanded ""holistic framework for risk management in public policy"" as a composite between empirical /factual and public context requirements. In our case study, the floods are the measurable parameters of the problem, and the public context is the focus toward large scale activation of the most vulnerable persons. We apply Spatial Analysis in Arc Gis Pro 2.3 to map the historic flood risk assessment and the rural agglomerations of the vulnerable persons. Floods are one of the highly relevant hazards for Romania. We use the historic flood risk assessment illustrated in the flood hazard map for Europe, 500-year return period, based on European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), but not an official one. In Romania, some of the most vulnerable persons are minimum income beneficiaries from rural areas. The result of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (Anselin, 2005) is the map of the minimum income benefit beneficiaries at the locality level (LAU former NUTS 5). Agglomerations correspond to the clusters locations with High - High (HH) income beneficiaries densities applying Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). The discussion concerns the rural areas social protection policies an additional dimension given by the Environment Security needs with ""Adaptive Social Protection"" (ASP) accordingly solutions (Devereux, 2016). Floods are next to climate change phenomenons and hazard disaster (Earthquakes, WildFire, Tsunami, Coastal Erosion, Landslide, Sea Level Rise, Natech, Biologica - according to Safaie et al., 2017), as a source of cumulative undesirable effects.

Synergies between rice production security and soil-related ecosystem services: From field observations to policy implementations,"CONTEXT: Agroecosystems provide crop provisioning service to support food security, as well as regulating services to maintain soil health. However, the relationships among ecosystem services (ES), rice production security, and soil attributes remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The study evaluates ecosystem services in a key rice production area and assesses factors such as productivity and soil conditions. METHODS: The study exemplifies a prominent rice-producing region in Taiwan and conducts three studies: (1) assessing and visualizing the status of land use, soil properties, and ecosystem services; (2) exploring the relationship between ES and environmental attributes; and (3) monetizing and analyzing the clustering of ES. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We visualize cropland ES including crop provision, soil carbon storage, water retention, nutrient retention, and soil erosion control. The relationship analysis indicates positive correlations between regulating services and crop productivity, as well as between soil carbon storage and soil conditions such as coarse texture and low drainage. It also highlights the importance of maintaining the agricultural environment and soil health. The valuation of cropland ES is estimated at US$16,400 per hectare per year, with soil carbon storage and water retention being the most significant contributors. Cluster analysis delineates spatial ES characteristics, guiding local sustainable management practices.

Effect Mechanism of Land Consolidation on Soil Bacterial Community: A Case Study in Eastern China,"Farmland consolidation is an effective tool to improve farmland infrastructures, soil quality, and sustain a healthy farmland ecosystem and rural population, generating contributions to food security and regional sustainable development. Previous studies showed that farmland consolidation regulates soil physical and chemical properties. Soil microorganisms also play an important role in soil health and crop performance; however, few studies reported how farmland consolidation influence soil microecology. Here, we used DNA sequencing technology to compare bacterial community structure in farmlands with and without consolidation. DNA sequencing technology is the most advanced technology used to obtain biological information in the world, and it has been widely used in the research of soil micro-ecological environment. In September 2018, we collected soil samples in Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, China, and used DNA sequence technology to compare the bacterial community structure in farmlands with and without consolidation. Our results found that (1) farmland consolidation had significant impacts on soil microbial characteristics, which were mainly manifested as changes in microbial biomass, microbial diversity and community structure. Farmland consolidation can increase the relative abundance of the three dominant bacteria phyla and the three fungal dominant phyla, but it also negatively affects the relative abundance of the six dominant bacteria phyla and the three fungal dominant phyla. (2) Farmland consolidation had an indirect impact on soil bacterial community structure by adjusting the soil physical and chemical properties. (3) The impact of heavy metals on bacterial community structure varied significantly under different levels of heavy metal pollution in farmland consolidation areas. There were 6, 3, 3, and 5 bacterial genera that had significant correlations with heavy metal content in cultivated land with low pollution, light pollution, medium pollution, and heavy pollution, respectively. The number of heavy metal-tolerant bacteria in the soil generally increased first and then decreased under heavy metal polluted conditions. Our study untangled the relationship between varied farmland consolidation strategies and bacteria through soil physcicochemical properties and metal pollution conditions. Our results can guide farmland consolidation strategies and sustain soil health and ecological balance in agriculture. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon and water scarcity footprints of banana under current and future climate conditions in the Brazilian semiarid region,"Climate change has become a global threat and a cause of uncertainty for numerous economic sectors, particularly agriculture. Several studies addressing the impacts of climate change can be found in the literature; however, studies on strategies to improve sustainability in orchards are scarce. Bananas are of great economic importance in tropical regions, and their production is characterized by high consumption of natural resources, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts. This study aimed to identify critical points in banana production, understand how they influence future footprints, and develop strategies to reduce current footprints. Life cycle assessment was used to estimate water scarcity (ISO 14046) and carbon (ISO 14067) footprints. Results are presented per 1 kg of banana. Primary data from 10-year averages were collected from farms located in the Lower Jaguaribe sub-basin. The results revealed that the carbon footprint ranged from 0.21 to 0.84 kg CO2 eq kg−1 in 2023, whereas the water scarcity footprint reached 1441 m3 eq kg−1. Under the current scenario, yield improvement could reduce carbon footprint by up to 57.9%, and greater efficiency in water use could decrease water footprint by up to 77%. In 2055, projections suggest that improvements in irrigation could lead to reductions of 5% in carbon footprint and 24.9% in water scarcity footprint. The findings of this study highlight the importance of adopting a sustainable approach to banana production, emphasizing the need to improve natural resource management and promote conscious agricultural practices, such as no-till farming and polyculture, which favor carbon sequestration. The use of plants that perform biological nitrogen fixation can reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizers, in alignment with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Public policies focused on providing technical assistance to farmers are crucial for achieving environmentally sustainable production and enhancing resilience to climate change and water scarcity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental and sustainability evaluation of livestock waste management practices in Cyprus,"The aim of this study was to compare the environmental performance and sustainability of different management options for livestock waste in Cyprus. The two most common practices in the country, i.e. the use of anaerobic lagoons and conventional biogas plants, were compared with the innovative scheme developed in the LiveWaste project (LIFE12 ENV/CY/000544), which aims not only to produce bioenergy, but also to treat the digestate for nutrient recovery and water reuse. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was combined with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to compare the performance of these alternatives. Four relevant indicators were selected for each dimension of sustainability (environmental, social and economic). The results of the evaluations showed that anaerobic lagoons are not an appropriate option for the sustainable management of livestock waste due to environmental (e.g. climate change, acidification and eutrophication) and social impacts (e.g. noise exposure, visual impact and risk perception for human health). The most important strengths and weaknesses of anaerobic treatment with and without digestate treatment were identified. Compared to conventional anaerobic digestion where digestate is directly applied as an organic fertiliser, the technology proposed in the project entails higher technological complexity due to nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery. The rise in chemical and electricity requirements increased the impacts on some indicators, such as climate change and operational cost (emissions of greenhouse gases and operation costs were around 50% higher), while reduced impacts in others due to proper nutrient management, as acidification and eutrophication impacts (which were 10 and almost two times lower, respectively). For the specific Cypriot conditions, where the overapplication of nutrients leads to pollution of water bodies, the innovative treatment scheme with higher technological development presents an interesting approach. Nevertheless, the treatment of the digestate should be analysed taking into account the specific characteristics of each scenario. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Editorial featured papers on environmental decisions,"Our society is facing serious environmental challenges related to climate change, pollution, diminishing resources, and biodiversity loss. Such problems are often ill-defined and are characterized by high uncertainty. Environmental decisions have strong impacts on society and demand clear and transparent trade-offs across values and priorities of stakeholder groups. This Feature Issue on Environmental Decisions includes papers focused on important environmental applications approached through various disciplinary backgrounds. The papers highlight advanced–often interdisciplinary–methodological approaches and include the perspectives of different stakeholders in the process of environmental decision-making. A wide range of methods are explored, ranging from a comprehensive review (for sustainable transport by Marleau Donais et al.) to an opinion paper proposing the use of Records of Engagement and Decision-making (RoED; by Cockerill et al.). Stakeholder engagement and preference elicitation required the development of new aggregation models for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA; by Reichert et al.). The integration of Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) with MCDA was found to be necessary in practice (by Liu et al.; Marleau Donais et al.). MCDA was extended to include the spatial dimension by integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS; by Guay et al.; Schito et al.). The importance of considering the resilience of systems to better respond to and recover from unpredictable risks was emphasized (by Leyerer et al.; Mustajoki and Marttunen).

The effects of seasonal human mobility and Aedes aegypti habitat suitability on Zika virus epidemic severity in Colombia,"The Zika virus epidemic of 2015–16, which caused over 1 million confirmed or suspected human cases in the Caribbean and Latin America, was driven by a combination of movement of infected humans and availability of suitable habitat for mosquito species that are key disease vectors. Both human mobility and mosquito vector abundances vary season-ally, and the goal of our research was to analyze the interacting effects of disease vector densities and human movement across metapopulations on disease transmission intensity and the probability of super-spreader events. Our research uses the novel approach of com-bining geographical modeling of mosquito presence with network modeling of human mobility to offer a comprehensive simulation environment for Zika virus epidemics that considers a substantial number of spatial and temporal factors compared to the literature. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that 1) regions with the highest probability of mosquito presence will have more super-spreader events during dry months, when mosquitoes are predicted to be more abundant, 2) regions reliant on tourism industries will have more super-spreader events during wet months, when they are more likely to contribute to network-level pathogen spread due to increased travel. We used the case study of Colombia, a country with a population of about 50 million people, with an annual calendar that can be partitioned into over-lapping cycles of wet and dry seasons and peak tourism and off tourism seasons that drive distinct cyclical patterns of mosquito abundance and human movement. Our results show that whether the first infected human was introduced to the network during the wet versus dry season and during the tourism versus off tourism season profoundly affects the severity and trajectory of the epidemic. For example, Zika virus was first detected in Colombia in October of 2015. Had it originated in January, a dry season month with high rates of tourism, it likely could have infected up to 60% more individuals and up to 40% more super-spreader events may have occurred. In addition, popular tourism destinations such as Barranquilla and Cartagena have the highest risk of super-spreader events during the winter, whereas densely populated areas such as Medellín and Bogotá are at higher risk of sustained transmission during dry months in the summer. Our research demonstrates that public health planning and response to vector-borne disease outbreaks requires a thorough under-standing of how vector and host patterns vary due to seasonality in environmental condi-tions and human mobility dynamics. This research also has strong implications for tourism policy and the potential response strategies in case of an emergent epidemic. © 2024 Lieberthal et al.",Not About Sufficiency
"Maternal mortality ratios in 2852 Chinese counties, 1996–2015, and achievement of Millennium Development Goal 5 in China: a subnational analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016","Background: As one of only a handful of countries that have achieved both Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5, China has substantially lowered maternal mortality in the past two decades. Little is known, however, about the levels and trends of maternal mortality at the county level in China. Methods: Using a national registration system of maternal mortality at the county level, we estimated the maternal mortality ratios for 2852 counties in China between 1996 and 2015. We used a state-of-the-art Bayesian small-area estimation hierarchical model with latent Gaussian layers to account for space and time correlations among neighbouring counties. Estimates at the county level were then scaled to be consistent with country-level estimates of maternal mortality for China, which were separately estimated from multiple data sources. We also assessed maternal mortality ratios among ethnic minorities in China and computed Gini coefficients of inequality of maternal mortality ratios at the country and provincial levels. Findings: China as a country has experienced fast decline in maternal mortality ratios, from 108·7 per 100 000 livebirths in 1996 to 21·8 per 100 000 livebirths in 2015, with an annualised rate of decline of 8·5% per year, which is much faster than the target pace in MDG 5. However, we found substantial heterogeneity in levels and trends at the county level. In 1996, the range of maternal mortality ratios by county was 16·8 per 100 000 livebirths in Shantou, Guangdong, to 3510·3 per 100 000 livebirths in Zanda County, Tibet. Almost all counties showed remarkable decline in maternal mortality ratios in the two decades regardless of those in 1996. The annualised rate of decline across counties from 1996 to 2015 ranges from 4·4% to 12·9%, and 2838 (99·5%) of the 2852 counties had achieved the MDG 5 pace of decline. Decline accelerated between 2005 and 2015 compared with between 1996 and 2005. In 2015, the lowest county-level maternal mortality ratio was 3·4 per 100 000 livebirths in Nanhu District, Zhejiang Province. The highest was still in Zanda County, Tibet, but the fall to 830·5 per 100 000 livebirths was only 76·3%. 26 ethnic groups had population majorities in at least one county in China, and all had achieved declines in maternal mortality ratios in line with the pace of MDG 5. Intercounty Gini coefficients for maternal mortality ratio have declined at the national level in China, indicating improved equality, whereas trends in inequality at the provincial level varied. Interpretation: In the past two decades, maternal mortality ratios have reduced rapidly and universally across China at the county level. Fast improvement in maternal mortality ratios is possible even in less economically developed places with resource constraints. This finding has important implications for improving maternal mortality ratios in developing countries in the Sustainable Development Goal era.

HTAP2 multi-model estimates of premature human mortality due to intercontinental transport of air pollution and emission sectors,"Ambient air pollution from ozone and fine particulate matter is associated with premature mortality. As emissions from one continent influence air quality over others, changes in emissions can also influence human health on other continents. We estimate global air-pollution-related premature mortality from exposure to PM2.5 and ozone and the avoided deaths due to 20 % anthropogenic emission reductions from six source regions, North America (NAM), Europe (EUR), South Asia (SAS), East Asia (EAS), Russia-Belarus-Ukraine (RBU), and the Middle East (MDE), three global emission sectors, power and industry (PIN), ground transportation (TRN), and residential (RES), and one global domain (GLO), using an ensemble of global chemical transport model simulations coordinated by the second phase of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollutants (TF HTAP2), and epidemiologically derived concentration response functions. We build on results from previous studies of TF HTAP by using improved atmospheric models driven by new estimates of 2010 anthropogenic emissions (excluding methane), with more source and receptor regions, new consideration of source sector impacts, and new epidemiological mortality functions. We estimate 290 000 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 30 000, 600 000) premature O3-related deaths and 2.8 million (0.5 million, 4.6 million) PM2.5-related premature deaths globally for the baseline year 2010. While 20 % emission reductions from one region generally lead to more avoided deaths within the source region than outside, reducing emissions from MDE and RBU can avoid more O3-related deaths outside of these regions than within, and reducing MDE emissions also avoids more PM2.5-related deaths outside of MDE than within. Our findings that most avoided O3-related deaths from emission reductions in NAM and EUR occur outside of those regions contrast with those of previous studies, while estimates of PM2.5-related deaths from NAM, EUR, SAS, and EAS emission reductions agree well. In addition, EUR, MDE, and RBU have more avoided O3-related deaths from reducing foreign emissions than from domestic reductions. For six regional emission reductions, the total avoided extra-regional mortality is estimated as 6000 (-3400, 15500) deaths per year and 25 100 (8200, 35800) deaths per year through changes in O3 and PM2.5, respectively. Interregional transport of air pollutants leads to more deaths through changes in PM2.5 than in O3, even though O3 is transported more on interregional scales, since PM2.5 has a stronger influence on mortality. For NAM and EUR, our estimates of avoided mortality from regional and extra-regional emission reductions are comparable to those estimated by regional models for these same experiments. In sectoral emission reductions, TRN emissions account for the greatest fraction (26-53 % of global emission reduction) of O3-related premature deaths in most regions, in agreement with previous studies, except for EAS (58 %) and RBU (38 %) where PIN emissions dominate. In contrast, PIN emission reductions have the greatest fraction (38-78 % of global emission reduction) of PM2.5-related deaths in most regions, except for SAS (45 %) where RES emission dominates, which differs with previous studies in which RES emissions dominate global health impacts. The spread of air pollutant concentration changes across models contributes most to the overall uncertainty in estimated avoided deaths, highlighting the uncertainty in results based on a single model. Despite uncertainties, the health benefits of reduced intercontinental air pollution transport suggest that international cooperation may be desirable to mitigate pollution transported over long distances. © 2018 Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"A Comprehensive Review of Dust Events: Characteristics, Climate Feedbacks, and Public Health Risks","Purpose of Review: Dust events are global meteorological disasters, affecting approximately 330 million people across 151 countries, from sub-Saharan Africa to northern China and Australia, with profound impacts on ecosystems, human health, and socioeconomics. The WMO airborne dust bulletin 2023 indicates that, dust concentrations in the most severely affected regions worldwide exceeded long-term averages, causing significant impacts on the global environment, economy, and public health. Recent Findings: In recent years, as climate change has led to an increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, research on the interactions between dust aerosols and the climate system, as well as their impacts on human health, has gradually become a hot topic. Studies have revealed the critical role of direct radiative feedback from East Asian dust in exacerbating dust-related air pollution in northern China. Other research highlights the combined effects of Arctic Sea ice anomalies, La Niña events, and a warmer northwestern Atlantic in creating loose, dry surface conditions across Mongolia, along with the formation of the strongest Mongolian cyclone in the past decade, which provided favorable dynamical disturbances and transport conditions for dust events. Furthermore, dust events have been shown to significantly increase the mortality risk from respiratory diseases, particularly chronic lower respiratory diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Circulatory disease mortality risks, including ischemic stroke and hypertensive heart disease, have also risen. These findings underscore the importance of further exploring the interactions between dust aerosols and regional climate, as well as their multidimensional impacts on human health. Summary: Dust events, as a global arid meteorological disaster, affect vast regions worldwide. In China, the severe spring dust storm of 2021 caused significant adverse impacts and economic losses across many northern cities. To enhance global awareness of dust events, strengthen international cooperation, and mitigate their impacts, the United Nations (UN) has designated 2025–2034 as the ""UN Decade for Combating Sand and Dust Storms"". Implementing effective dust control policies, building climate-resilient health systems, and enhancing efforts in risk mitigation, prevention, response, and recovery can significantly reduce health risks. This review aims to summarize recent advances in research on the impacts of dust on climate and human health. It contributes to expanding our understanding of the climatic effects of dust aerosols and provides crucial scientific evidence for addressing climate change and developing strategies to mitigate health risks associated with dust exposure. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
"Precipitation and soil texture dominate the spatiotemporal changes in the carbon-water coupling coordination in Taihang Mountains, China","The Taihang Mountains in North China are an important carbon-water ecosystem service supply area. Understanding the coupling effect and influencing mechanisms of mountain carbon sequestration as well as water conservation is essential for regional ecological restoration and sustainable development. In this study, we utilized models such as the coupled coordination degree model, the random forest and Geodetector to analyze the spatio-temporal changes as well as driving factors of carbon sequestration-water conservation coupling coordination in the Taihang Mountains. The results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the carbon sequestration and water conservation capacity of the Taihang Mountains exhibited a spatial pattern with higher values in the southeast and central regions, while lower values in the northwest region. (2) The average coupling coordination degree from 1990 to 2020 was 0.23, which was overall low, with a fluctuating decreasing-rising-decreasing trend over time. The coupling coordination degree exhibited a pattern that is high in the middle and low in the periphery, with a fluctuating distribution that initially decreases and then increases with the increasing altitude. The overall trend of coupling coordination is degradation, with concentrated degradation in the northwest mountainous regions. (3) Precipitation and soil texture were identified as the main driving factors influencing coupling coordination, with the interaction between precipitation and soil sand content showing the strongest explanatory power, while that among topography, vegetation and human activities had relatively low explanatory power. Therefore, enhanced protection and the continuous monitoring of vegetation and soil environments in the Taihang Mountains are essential, with particular emphasis on ecological restoration in areas experiencing a persistent degradation of carbon-water coupling. This study can provide assistance in monitoring and managing carbon sink and water resources in the mountains, meanwhile mitigating potential adverse impacts on human well-being. © Science Press 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
"Multiscale Ecological Zoning Management with Coupled Ecosystem Service Bundles and Supply–Demand Balance, the Case of Hangzhou, China","Grasping the interrelationship between the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs) and spatial scale characteristics is the foundation for effective ecological zoning management, which helps to realize a win–win situation for both ecological protection and economic development. This paper focuses on the following three real problems: mismatch in ES supply and demand evaluation, mechanical and subjective delineation of ecological zoning, and rough management strategies, and constructs a multi-scale ecological zoning management framework for the “comprehensive evaluation of supply and demand, ecological zoning, and enhancement of human well-being”. This study integrates the InVEST model, SOM, Z-score quadrant matching, and coordination degree method, and applies them to the ecological management zoning of Hangzhou. The results show that (1) the spatial differentiation of ESs in Hangzhou is significant. The spatial pattern of the five types of ES supply varies at the county scale and the grid scale on which ES demand is concentrated and is consistent at different scales. (2) ES supply–demand matching in Hangzhou is at the basic coordination and can be divided into four modes including HH, LH, LL, and HL at both the county and grid scales. On the small scale, the proportion of mismatches declines slightly, but the severity rises. (3) ES supply is divided into four categories as follows: the food production bundle, the carbon storage bundle, the ESs balancing bundle, and the ESs depleting bundle, and clarifies the priority of ES management. (4) Construct an ecological management practice path, delineates 6 ecological management zones at the county scale and 19 secondary management zones at the grid scale. Targeted measures are proposed in terms of supply–demand adjustment strategies, ecological management strategies, and key implementation areas. This study helps to incorporate the interaction between the supply and demand of ESs into the planning framework and provides decision-making support for refined ecological management. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Water-energy-food nexus in China: An interregional comparison,"The geographical mismatch between water availability and demand further exacerbates the challenge of the water-energy-food nexus in China. This study characterizes competing water uses for crops and energy to reveal their resulting impacts on regional inequality by integrating the modified Gini coefficient and unbalanced index with respect to water scarcity and water surplus. From 2000–2019, China's food production decreased by 2.3 % in the blue water footprint (ranging from −90.3 % to 71.7 % for specific provinces), while the energy sector increased by 111.9 % (varying from −69.9 % to 692.4 %). The energy sector showed greater inequality in blue water consumption verses available water, with the Gini coefficient ranged from 0.43 to 0.62, while the food-water nexus maintained a relatively stable value of approximately 0.35. Spatially, there was consistent water scarcity inequality in the north and water surplus inequality in the south for both the food-water and the energy-water nexus. Overall, the energy-water nexus exhibited larger variations in provincial inequalities. This divergent evolving inequality was primarily caused by a combination of factors that included resource endowments, regional economic disparities, and government interventions. These findings can inform policy makers towards optimizing the management of water-energy-food resources. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Deciphering the driving factors and probabilistic health risks of potentially toxic elements in arid surface water: Insights from the Tarim River Basin,"Potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in surface water in arid areas pose a serious threat to environmental safety and human health within a basin. It is important to determine the factors controlling PTEs and to assess the likelihood that they will pose a risk to human health in order to support the development of environmental protection and risk management strategies. In this study, a structural equation model and Bayesian method were combined to discuss the distribution and probabilistic health risks of PTEs in surface water in arid area, and the Tarim River Basin was taken as a case study. The results show that the average concentrations of As, Co, Cu, and Ni in the surface water in the Tarim River Basin ranged from 0.04 to 2.92 μg/L, which do not exceed the international standard values. However, the maximum value of As (19.20 μg/L) exceeded both the recommended drinking water standards and the Chinese irrigation water standards. Spatially, the high As concentrations were distributed in the upper reaches of the Kashgar River, and the high Co, Cu and Ni concentrations were distributed in reservoirs and lakes on the main stream of the Tarim River. The concentrations of the PTEs in the surface water in the basin were not only affected by random anthropogenic factors such as traffic discharge, agricultural activities and mining industry, but were also directly and indirectly influenced by climatic factors. The results of the probabilistic health risk assessment showed that the 95th percentile the total hazard index for infants exceeded the allowable value of 1, and the total carcinogenic risk of PTEs exposure in four age groups was at the notable level. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the controlling factors and health risks associated with PTEs in surface water in the Tarim River Basin, and the findings are expected to provide a scientific basis for regional water environment management and safety control. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of media coverage on the ESG performance of heavily polluting enterprises in China,"Based on panel data from 2011 to 2021 encompassing 390 listed enterprises in China, we investigate the potential influence of media coverage on the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance of heavy-polluting enterprises. The study discerns that positive media coverage significantly contributes to an enhanced ESG performance among heavy-polluting enterprises, particularly those in eastern and western China and those entrenched within highly competitive industries. Positive media coverage predominantly amplifies these enterprises’ environmental and social performance dimensions, while intriguingly, negative media coverage unexpectedly positively impacts their environmental performance. Green total factor productivity and green innovation emerge as crucial facilitators in bolstering the relationship between positive media coverage and the ESG performance of these enterprises. Our research findings provide valuable insights into understanding enterprise ESG behavior and the role of media coverage. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
A Systematic Bibliometric Review of Fiscal Redistribution Policies Addressing Poverty Vulnerability,"The elimination of poverty in all its forms is the first global goal of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Achieving this goal is recognized as a long-term process that is complicated by persistent vulnerabilities stemming from factors such as natural disasters, food insecurity, health challenges, educational disparities, and social inequality. This systematic bibliometric review provides a comprehensive survey of the impact of social protection-based policies in mitigating poverty vulnerability, focusing on selected countries and regions, including America, Europe, Oceania, and part of Asia and Africa. Our analysis reveals that 81% of the studies examine poverty vulnerability from a single dimension, predominantly focusing on food security and nutrition (23%), climate change shocks (18%), and health-related vulnerabilities (14%). The geographic distribution indicates that the United Kingdom and the United States lead research in this field, contributing 36 and 32 papers, respectively, followed by China (16 papers), South Africa (15 papers), and Canada (10 papers). The results indicate that these fiscal redistribution policies significantly contribute to reducing poverty and inequality and have positive impacts on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities). However, notable gaps remain, especially regarding the integration of these policies with environmental sustainability goals like SDG 13 (Climate Action), which are addressed in only a minority of studies. This study concludes by recommending the adoption of more holistic and integrated policy frameworks that bridge the gap between social protection and environmental sustainability, thereby advancing the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring cost-effective measure portfolios for ecosystem services optimization under large-scale vegetation restoration,"Ecosystem services-based land management incorporates environmental features and social needs, providing an important opportunity to realize global sustainability goals. Recent decades, the interaction among water-related ecosystem services (ESs) is getting ambiguous during regional vegetation restoration, which entails challenges for coordinating restoration actions, economic resources, and water-soil resources' availability. In this study, we first explored mechanism of trade-offs among five water-related ESs in the Chinese Loess Plateau under vegetation restoration. Given the decreased baseflow and its widespread trade-offs with water quality, we then developed four scenarios aiming at enhancing the baseflow and nutrient retention in a cost-effective way, by engaging a spatially explicit biophysical software tool—the RIOS model. Moreover, we selected four typical watersheds in the Loess Plateau as cases to demonstrate the differentiated information on the budget levels and the activity sites. The results indicated that, a deep mechanism of scale effects of trade-off among ESs was largely related to spatial heterogeneity rather than spatial resolution, which also affected activity portfolios under different ES scenarios. For the entire Loess Plateau, activity of forest maintenance should be concentrated on the cost-effective locations of investment for the enhancement of baseflow and nutrient retention. Under the regular budget scenarios, trade-offs only could be locally alleviated in reality, while dropping the high-cost ES objectives is an advisable strategy for minimizing investment risk. Taking conservation agricultural practices in the plain river basins should be regarded as a priority when budget can be increased. In contrast, an approach of ‘governing by non-interference’ for typical watersheds of re-vegetation was sensible strategy for avoiding trade-offs aggravation. These findings emphasized interrelation between the mechanism of ESs trade-offs and activity portfolios, which is an important basis for the implementation of conservation activities in real world context, and a rational reference for the simulation of desired ES goals in future studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Emergence, distribution dynamics and drivers of global high-emission countries since the Industrial Revolution","The CO2 emission from fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution is associated with critical development rights driven by economic and population growth. We defined high-emission countries as major emitters whose emission contributed 80% to global emission based on descending order of national emission, and analysed their emergence, distribution dynamics and drivers, which expect to unravel the processes of their emission surges and entwined carbon inequality in history. Our results show that: 1) 31 countries formed the group of high-emission countries and hardly exit from group; 2) high-emission countries appeared in Europe first, then spread to North America, Asia and finally throughout all continents; 3) population growth and economic growth stimulated the rapid emission growth of earliest industrialised countries and several short phases after industrialisation finished, respectively. Blend impacts transformed most developing countries to high-emission countries after World War II. We also discussed glooming climate mitigation ambitions because of pervasive carbon inequity. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Construction of ecological security pattern adapting to future land use change in Pearl River Delta, China","Land use and cover change (LUCC) can often threaten urban ecological space and cause enormous impacts on the ecosystem, and sustainable ecological security patterns (ESPs) should receive more attention in urban landscape planning to adapt to future environmental changes. Thus, this research explored a multi-scenario framework of ESP by coupling the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) and Minimum Cumulative Resistance (MCR) models for long-term sustainable ecological security in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. The results show that areas of ecological sources in 2030 under the natural development scenario (NDS), economic development scenario (EDS), food security scenario (FSS), and ecological priority scenario (EPS) will account for 11.58%, 3.71%, 10.55%, and 16.50% of the total area, respectively. 45 ecological corridors under NDS, EDS, FSS, and EPS will be 8573.07 km, 7970.54 km, 9197.15 km, and 7769.24 km, respectively. The future corridors, that will be annularly in the periphery of economic development zones, can better balance economic development and ecological protection. Under the EPS scenario, the constructed ESP will have the best network structure and can effectively protect ecological land and reduce damage.

Smog and Air Pollution: Journalistic Criticism and Environmental Accountability in China,"This article examines critical environmental reporting of the Chinese smog crisis, also known as the PM2.5 crisis, which are episodes of heavy particulate air pollution. By focusing on the sequence of media attention on PM2.5 standards and metrics, I show how the narrow focus on smog pollution developed into a broader critique of China's economic development model and of how government makes and carries out policy. I argue that environmental journalists have played a key role in promoting accountability on governments for tackling smog. At different stages of the smog crisis, journalists managed to show or create links between PM2.5 metrics and wider issues of public health, economic development, political power, social injustice, civic involvement and China's place in the world. They were able to employ the smog issue to make broader political and economic critiques, demanding greater government accountability and transparency in smog governance. Journalistic criticisms intensified public pressure on the authorities for reducing pollution and improving air quality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Application of L-moment method for regional frequency analysis of meteorological drought across the Loess Plateau, China","Water shortages have always been the primary bottleneck for the healthy and sustainable development of the ecological environment on the Loess Plateau (LP). Proper water resource management requires knowledge of the spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitation frequency. This paper employed the gridded precipitation dataset obtained from the China Meteorological Data Service Centre to present a spatially explicit characterization of precipitation frequencies in tandem with their return periods on the LP based on the L-moment method. The 60% and 80% of the mean annual precipitation from 1981 to 2010 were synonymous with severe and moderate droughts, respectively. Droughts occurred more frequently in the northwest than in the southeast of the LP. Moreover, the frequencies of moderate drought showed a slight difference throughout the area, while those of severe droughts demonstrated considerable differences between the northwestern arid zone and the southeastern semi-humid zone. The maps associated with various return periods of precipitation deficits can be used to produce drought risk maps together with drought vulnerability maps. These findings could also provide useful information for drought management, water resource management and the development of food security policies. © 2022 Li et al.

Does green credit policy affect corporate debt financing? Evidence from China,"Green finance is one of the most important ways to help companies achieve green transformation and development. We construct a quasi-natural experiment with the “Green Credit Guidelines” and establish a difference-in-differences model to empirically test the implementation effect of the green credit policy in China. The results show that after the implementation of China’s green credit policy, the debt financing scale of listed companies in heavily polluting industries has decreased significantly, the debt financing cost has increased significantly, and the debt financing maturity has been shortened significantly, indicating that the green credit policy has inhibited the debt financing of heavily polluting enterprises. We further find that this inhibition has also been affected by the nature of controlling shareholders, environmental information disclosure levels, regional environmental regulations and regional financial development levels. China’s green credit policy has played a role in guiding listed companies to go green through the redistribution of debt financing. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
The Spatiotemporal Evolution Characteristics of Cultivated Land Multifunction and Its Trade-Off/Synergy Relationship in the Two Lake Plains,"The material foundation of sustainable agricultural development is cultivated land resources, and their sustainable use is critical to fostering agricultural sustainability and guaranteeing national food security. In this paper, the multifunctional evaluation framework of the cultivated land system based on the “GESEL” model at the grid scale (5 km × 5 km) is constructed to explore the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of a multifunctional cultivated land system in two lake plains and the trade-off and synergy between the functions. The five functions are all unstable in time scales, and their spatial distribution characteristics are also different. The trade-off and synergy between the multiple functions of the cultivated land system in the two lake plains from 2000 to 2019 showed significant spatial heterogeneity. Most of the functions were mainly collaborative, and a few were trade-offs. The two lake plains can be divided into four multi-functional cultivated land zones: a grain production leading zone, a distinctive agricultural planting zone, a high-efficiency agricultural development zone, and an ecological agricultural construction zone. This research puts forward some countermeasures and suggestions to promote the sustainable utilization of cultivated land resources. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Balancing food security and environmental sustainability by optimizing seasonal-spatial crop production in Bangladesh,"The intensification of crop production has been identified as one of the major drivers of environmental degradation. While significant advances could still be made with more widespread adoption of sustainable intensification technologies that address the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen fertilizers, the dynamic use of agricultural land across seasons and associated crop-specific responses to fertilizer applications have so far been largely overlooked. This paper explores the potential for improving the economic-environmental performance of crop production through spatially integrated modeling and optimization, as applied to Bangladesh. Results show that per-billion-Taka nitrogen loss from soil would decline by 83% from the baseline level through factoring in crop-specific, seasonal and spatial variations in crop nitrogen-use efficiency and nitrogen transport. The approach should complement other policy analysis and decision-support tools to assess alternative options for maximizing the positive outcomes of nitrogen fertilizers with regard to farm income and food security, while maintaining environmental sustainability. © 2021 The Author(s).

Responses of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Productivity to Droughts in China,"The terrestrial ecosystem productivity (hereafter, TEP) is a key index of global carbon cycles and a fundamental constraint of carbon sequestration capacity, and also an important measure of ecosystem services and food security. However, the TEP has been significantly affected by the long-lasting droughts. Identifying the spatial relationship between droughts and the TEP is crucial for enhancing ecosystem services in China. Here the net primary production (hereafter, NPP) derived from the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model (CASA-NPP) and two drought indices, namely the Standard Precipitation Index (hereafter, SPI) and the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (hereafter, SPEI), are used to examine the spatial relationship between droughts and the NPP in China for the period of 1982–2012. Our main results have shown that: (1) China’s annual NPP has increased slowly from 3.82 to 4.35 PgC per year (hereafter, PgC/yr), while droughts have become much severer from 1982 to 2012; (2) on the 3-month timescale, the NPP in arid and semi-arid ecosystems has decreased at a rate of 1.28 TgC per month with per “unit” decrease in the drought index (indicating drier conditions). (3) Overall, the NPP in China has increased 5.71 TgC per month with per “unit” increase in the drought index (indicating wetter conditions); the contribution of this NPP increase is mainly from forests and farmlands; (4) the SPEI is a relatively more effective and sensitive index in representing China’s droughts. In southern China, the lagging period for the NPP response to droughts is about 3-month, while a 6-month lagging period is found in the arid and semi-arid ecosystems in northern China. © Copyright © 2020 Li, Wang and Liu.",Not About Sufficiency
"Dynamic linkages among economic development, environmental pollution and human health in Chinese","Background: Research on the relationships between economic development, energy consumption, environmental pollution, and human health has tended to focus on the relationships between economic growth and air pollution, energy and air pollution, or the impact of air pollution on human health. However, there has been little past research focused on all the above associations. Methods: The few studies that have examined the interconnections between the economy, energy consumption, environmental pollution and health have tended to employ regression analyses, DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis), or DEA efficiency analyses; however, as these are static analysis tools, the analyses did not fully reveal the sustainable economic, energy, environmental or health developments over time, did not consider the regional differences, and most often ignored community health factors. To go some way to filling this gap, this paper developed a modified two stage Undesirable Meta Dynamic Network model to jointly analyze energy consumption, economic growth, air pollution and health treatment data in 31 Chinese high-income and upper-middle income cities from 2013-2016, for which the overall efficiency, production efficiency, healthcare resource utilization efficiency and technology gap ratio (TGR) for all input and output variables were calculated. Results: It was found that: (1) the annual average overall efficiency in China's eastern region was the highest; (2) the production stage efficiencies were higher than the healthcare resource utilization stage efficiencies in most cities; (3) the high-income cities had lower TGRs than the upper-middle income cities; (4) the high-income cities had higher average energy consumption efficiencies than the upper-middle income cities; (5) the health expenditure efficiencies were the lowest of all inputs; (6) the high-income cities' respiratory disease and mortality rate efficiencies were higher than in the upper-middle income cities, which had improving mortality rate efficiencies; and (7) there were significant regional differences in the annual average input and output indicator efficiencies. Conclusions: First, the high-income cities had higher average efficiencies than the upper-middle income cities. Of the ten eastern region high-income cities, Guangzhou and Shanghai had average efficiencies of 1, with the least efficient being Shijiazhuang. In the other regions, the upper-middle income cities required greater technology and health treatment investments. Second, Guangzhou, Lhasa, Nanning, and Shanghai had production efficiencies of 1, and Guangzhou, Lhasa, Nanning, Shanghai and Fuzhou had healthcare resource utilization efficiencies of 1. As the average production stage efficiencies in most cities were higher than the healthcare resource utilization stage efficiencies, greater efforts are needed to improve the healthcare resource utilization. Third, the technology gap ratios (TGRs) in the high-income cities were slightly higher than in the upper-middle income cities. Therefore, the upper-middle income cities need to learn from the high-income cities to improve their general health treatment TGRs. Fourth, while the high-income cities had higher energy consumption efficiencies than the upper-middle income cities, these were decreasing in most cities. There were few respiratory disease efficiency differences between the high-income and upper-middle income cities, the high-income cities had falling mortality rate efficiencies, and the upper-middle income cities had increasing mortality rate efficiencies. Overall, therefore, most cities needed to strengthen their health governance to balance economic growth and urban expansion. Fifth, the average AQI efficiencies in both the high-income and upper-middle income cities were higher than the average CO2 efficiencies. However, the high-income cities had lower average CO2 emissions and AQI efficiencies than the upper-middle income cities, with the AQI efficiency differences between the two city groups expanding. As most cities were focusing more on air pollution controls than carbon dioxide emissions, greater efforts were needed in coordinating the air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions treatments. Therefore, the following suggestions are given. (1) The government should reform the hospital and medical systems. (2) Local governments need to strengthen their air pollution and disease education. (3) High-income cities need to improve their healthcare governance to reduce the incidence of respiratory diseases and the associated mortality. (4) Healthcare governance efficiency needs to be prioritized in 17 upper-middle income cities, such as Hangzhou, Changchun, Harbin, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming and Xi'an, by establishing sound medical management systems and emergency environmental pollution treatments, and by increasing capital asset medical investments. (5) Upper-middle income cities need to adapt their treatment controls to local conditions and design medium to long-term development strategies. (6) Upper-middle income cities need to actively learn from the technological and governance experiences in the more efficient higher-income cities. © 2020 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of El Niño and La Niña impacts on China: Enhancing the Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture,"Assessing crop production variations is of great importance for agriculture and food security worldwide. The impacts of El Niño and La Niña events are particularly critical for understanding these variations. Besides the individual El Niño and La Niña event, newly-identified El Niño and La Niña dominant cycles also add another dimension into the analysis. As the world largest food producer and importer, China has endeavored to increase its agricultural production while reducing climate risks over time. By using satellite-based indicators, ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) indices and grain yield statistics for China, the characteristics of ENSO events, as well as their relationships with crop-growing conditions and yields at different administrative levels are analyzed. The results show that the evaluation of agricultural impacts of an El Niño/La Niña event should consider both the dominant cycle in which the event occurs and the characteristics of the event itself, combined with local crop phenology. Additionally, county and prefectural level analysis shows that over the long term, in China, La Niña events tend to have net positive impacts on grain productivity compared to the effects of El Niño events. The analysis and methods presented can be extended to other countries in the world and help better understand the local agricultural impact of El Niño and La Niña phenomena. This, in turn, would improve the agriculture and food security related early warning capacities of countries to issue and trigger targeted and timely response and climate risk reduction measures. © 2019 The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations",Not About Sufficiency
Key factors influencing low-carbon behaviors of staff in star-rated hotels—an empirical study of eastern China,"To guide sustainable development in the hospitality industry requires hotel staff engagement, so what causes and how to facilitate the implementation of low-carbon behaviors should be high priorities. However, most prior studies focused on hotel guest behavior or discussed, on an individual level, the psychological aspects of the factors of the low-carbon behavior of either managers or employees. Therefore, this research aims to examine the effect of influencing factors inside and outside of the hotel context on hotel staff’s low-carbon behaviors in star-rated hotels. A set of influencing factors were identified by using literature retrieval, ground theory and in-depth interviews. Structural equation modelling was then applied with 440 valid questionnaires collected from representative star-rated hotels in Eastern China. The results revealed that low-carbon managerial activities, strategic orientation, social norms, and perceived behavior control were four key factors affecting the low-carbon behavior adoption of staff from star-rated hotels. Among them, low-carbon managerial activities were found to be the strongest factor affecting hotel staff’s lowcarbon behaviors. Consumer attitude, however, exerted no significant impact. Targeted strategies were finally proposed for the improvement of hotel staff’s low-carbon behavior from the perspectives of hoteliers and governments. This study contributes to the generation mechanism of low-carbon behavior among staff and, in practice, towards behavioral improvement by providing comprehensive insights about the attribution of factors belonging to multiple dimensions related to the low-carbon behavior of staff in the hotel industry. © 2020 by the authors.

Research and Outlook on Global Energy Interconnection,"Currently, the world is confronted with a series of challenges including resource shortage, climate change, environment pollution and energy poverty, which are rooted in the humanity's deep dependence on and large-scale consumption of fossil energy. To tackle with those challenges is an urgent task for realizing sustainable development. The Global Energy Interconnection (GEI) is a clean energy-dominant, electricity-centered, interconnected and shared modern energy system. It is an important platform for large-scale development, transmission and utilization of clean energy resources at a global level, promoting the global energy transition characterized by cleaning, decarbonization, electrification and networking. The GEI has provided a scientific, novel and systematic solution to implement Agenda 2030 as well as the Paris Agreement. Focusing on the scope of clean transition and sustainable development, this paper has implemented qualitative and quantitative methods based on historic data. The global power demand and supply has been forecasted. Based on global clean energy resources endowments and distribution, a global main clean energy bases layout and generation planning optimization has been proposed. Later in this paper, the global power flow under the GEI scenario and corresponding GEI backbone grid has been explored and proposed. Finally, based on a preliminary investment estimation, the comprehensive benefits of building the GEI have been analyzed. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5): The culprit for chronic lung diseases in China,"Air pollution is a world public health problem. Particulate matter (PM), a mix of solid and liquid particles in the air, becomes an increasing concern in the social and economic development of China. For decades, epidemiological studies have confirmed the association between fine particle pollutants and respiratory diseases. It has been reported in different populations that increased Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations cause elevated susceptibility to respiratory diseases, including acute respiratory distress, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. This review will discuss the pathophysiology of PM2.5 in respiratory diseases, which are helpful for the prevention of air pollution and treatment of respiratory tract inflammatory diseases. © 2018 Chinese Medical Association",Not About Sufficiency

Optimization of irrigation scheduling for spring wheat based on simulation-optimization model under uncertainty,"Water scarcity is the major constraint to social-economic development in arid and semiarid regions, where irrigation needs to be scheduled properly for the main crops. In this study, a simulation-optimization model for crop optimal irrigation scheduling under uncertainty was developed to maximize the net benefit. The model integrated a water-driven crop model (AquaCrop) with the optimization model, and incorporated the generation technique for the interval values of hydrological parameters (i.e., precipitation and evapotranspiration) and crop market prices to deal with uncertainties in these variables. The water price was assumed constant. The model was calibrated based on field experimental data obtained in 2014 and validated using 2015 data. The field experiments involved spring wheat (Yongliang No. 4) at Shiyang River Basin Experiment Station in Wuwei City, Gansu Province of Northwest China. The model was then used to generate the optimal irrigation schedules under various irrigation amounts, irrigation events, initial soil water storage and crop market price under uncertainty. Results indicated that the model is applicable for reflecting the complexities of simulation-optimization under uncertainties for spring wheat irrigation water scheduling. The optimization results indicated that the optimal irrigation amount range was [185, 322] mm with the corresponding optimal net benefit of [1.05, 2.77] ×104 Yuan/hm2 and yield of [7.4, 7.6] kg/hm2 for extreme wet conditions in the basin (defined as the combination of the 5% frequency precipitation with 95% frequency evapotranspiration). For extreme dry conditions, the optimal irrigation amount range was [442, 507] mm with the optimal net benefit of [0.85, 2.64] ×104 Yuan/hm2 and the corresponding yield of [6.6, 7.4] kg/hm2. Results also showed that four irrigation events under higher initial soil water storage were more likely to produce the higher net benefit and the optimal net benefit would increase as the crop market price increases, as expected. This work can be used to guide irrigation management for local farmers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Using System Dynamic Model and Neural Network Model to Analyse Water Scarcity in Sudan,"Many parts of the world are facing the problem of Water Scarcity. Analysing Water Scarcity quantitatively is an important step to solve the problem. Water scarcity in a region is gauged by WSI (water scarcity index), which incorporate water supply and water demand. To get the WSI, Neural Network Model and SDM (System Dynamic Model) that depict how environmental and social factors affect water supply and demand are developed to depict how environmental and social factors affect water supply and demand. The uneven distribution of water resource and water demand across a region leads to an uneven distribution of WSI within this region. To predict WSI for the future, logistic model, Grey Prediction, and statistics are applied in predicting variables. Sudan suffers from severe water scarcity problem with WSI of 1 in 2014, water resource unevenly distributed. According to the result of modified model, after the intervention, Sudan's water situation will become better. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
An intuitionistic fuzzy multi-objective non-linear programming model for sustainable irrigation water allocation under the combination of dry and wet conditions,"Water scarcity causes conflicts among natural resources, society and economy and reinforces the need for optimal allocation of irrigation water resources in a sustainable way. Uncertainties caused by natural conditions and human activities make optimal allocation more complex. An intuitionistic fuzzy multi-objective non-linear programming (IFMONLP) model for irrigation water allocation under the combination of dry and wet conditions is developed to help decision makers mitigate water scarcity. The model is capable of quantitatively solving multiple problems including crop yield increase, blue water saving, and water supply cost reduction to obtain a balanced water allocation scheme using a multi-objective non-linear programming technique. Moreover, it can deal with uncertainty as well as hesitation based on the introduction of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Consideration of the combination of dry and wet conditions for water availability and precipitation makes it possible to gain insights into the various irrigation water allocations, and joint probabilities based on copula functions provide decision makers an average standard for irrigation. A case study on optimally allocating both surface water and groundwater to different growth periods of rice in different subareas in Heping irrigation area, Qing'an County, northeast China shows the potential and applicability of the developed model. Results show that the crop yield increase target especially in tillering and elongation stages is a prevailing concern when more water is available, and trading schemes can mitigate water supply cost and save water with an increased grain output. Results also reveal that the water allocation schemes are sensitive to the variation of water availability and precipitation with uncertain characteristics. The IFMONLP model is applicable for most irrigation areas with limited water supplies to determine irrigation water strategies under a fuzzy environment. © 2017",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment on the impact of arable land protection policies in a rapidly developing region,"To investigate the effect of arable land protection policies in China, a practical framework that integrates geographic information systems (GIS), soil quality assessment and landscape metrics analysis was employed to track and analyze arable land transformations and landscape changes in response to rampant urbanization within the Ningbo region (China) from 2005 to 2013. The results showed that arable land loss and degradation have continued, despite the development of a comprehensive legal framework for arable land protection. The implementation of arable land protection policies is judged to be effective, but not entirely successful, because it guarantees the overall amount of arable land but does not consider soil quality and spatial distribution. In addition, there are distinct variations in arable land change dynamics between two temporal intervals. From 2005-2009, the transformation of arable land was diversified, with intensified conversion among arable land, built-up land, water and orchards. Moreover, many new arable land parcels were adjacent to built-up land, and are in danger of being occupied again through urban sprawl. By 2009-2013, most of the arable land was occupied by urban expansion, whereas a majority of newly increased arable land was reclaimed from coastal tideland. Although the newly increased arable land was contiguous and far from the urban area, it is of poor quality and has limited use. The permanent loss of high-quality arable land due to intensified urban sprawl may threaten sustainable development and food security on a larger scale. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency

"Assessment tools, prevailing issues and policy implications of mining community sustainability in China","Mining and mineral extraction play a prominent part in the historical development of communities around the world. However, mineral development has inevitable adverse impacts on local development, environment and urban ecology. Consequently, the process of mining-led development is often associated with conflicts between corporate mining objectives, recipient community needs and governmental policy goals for regional development. Given these environmental, economic and socio-political problems associated with mineral development, the critical research question is not only whether mining is a sustainable operation for urban development but also what is the possible process and extent to achieve local sustainable development in mining communities. Based on a previous quantitative investigation on the development of sustainability within mining communities, the current article aims at presenting a multi-faceted approach to mineral development, outlining a hierarchical indicator system for providing tools to assess the sustainability of mining communities, discussing the prevailing issues affecting mining community sustainability, and analysing policy implications for achieving better sustainability with mining communities in China. It has been found that the weakness of sustainability development in Chinese mining communities is due to five major issues: mineral exhaustion, environmental degradation, mine safety and health noncompliance, bureaucratic impediments, and lack of social responsibility. For possible responses to these issues, the analysis of policy implications of the weakness of sustainability has revealed that research and development must be enhanced, economic instruments must be improved, and institutional reforms must be promoted. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Transportation sustainability in China,"China has moved into a stage for fast urbanization. Urbanization strategies are essential for improving economic competition ability and promoting modernization. Transportation sustainability plays an essential role in the urbanization process. There are obvious contradictions between transportation infrastructure construction and environmental conservation. In China, environmental problems associated with the quick increase of roadway transportation have been fully recognized. Air pollution is one of the major problems caused by increased vehicle travel, leading to severe concerns on environmental conservation and public health. This paper discusses transportation sustainability in China and the measures taken to reduce negative impacts from transportation development. Our analysis indicates that effective enforcement regulations are needed to ensure the reduction of vehicle emissions to reach the goal of transportation sustainability. © 2011 ASCE.",Not About Sufficiency
"Climate change, human rights, and social justice","The environmental and health consequences of climate change, which disproportionately affect low-income countries and poor people in high-income countries, profoundly affect human rights and social justice. Environmental consequences include increased temperature, excess precipitation in some areas and droughts in others, extreme weather events, and increased sea level. These consequences adversely affect agricultural production, access to safe water, and worker productivity, and, by inundating land or making land uninhabitable and uncultivatable, will force many people to become environmental refugees. Adverse health effects caused by climate change include heat-related disorders, vector-borne diseases, foodborne and waterborne diseases, respiratory and allergic disorders, malnutrition, collective violence, and mental health problems. These environmental and health consequences threaten civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural rights, including rights to life, access to safe food and water, health, security, shelter, and culture. On a national or local level, those people who are most vulnerable to the adverse environmental and health consequences of climate change include poor people, members of minority groups, women, children, older people, people with chronic diseases and disabilities, those residing in areas with a high prevalence of climate-related diseases, and workers exposed to extreme heat or increased weather variability. On a global level, there is much inequity, with low-income countries, which produce the least greenhouse gases (GHGs), being more adversely affected by climate change than high-income countries, which produce substantially higher amounts of GHGs yet are less immediately affected. In addition, lowincome countries have far less capability to adapt to climate change than high-income countries. Adaptation and mitigation measures to address climate change needed to protect human society must also be planned to protect human rights, promote social justice, and avoid creating new problems or exacerbating existing problems for vulnerable populations. © 2015 The Authors.

Toward Sustainable Environmental Quality: Priority Research Questions for Asia,"Environmental and human health challenges are pronounced in Asia, an exceptionally diverse and complex region where influences of global megatrends are extensive and numerous stresses to environmental quality exist. Identifying priorities necessary to engage grand challenges can be facilitated through horizon scanning exercises, and to this end we identified and examined 23 priority research questions needed to advance toward more sustainable environmental quality in Asia, as part of the Global Horizon Scanning Project. Advances in environmental toxicology, environmental chemistry, biological monitoring, and risk-assessment methodologies are necessary to address the adverse impacts of environmental stressors on ecosystem services and biodiversity, with Asia being home to numerous biodiversity hotspots. Intersections of the food–energy–water nexus are profound in Asia; innovative and aggressive technologies are necessary to provide clean water, ensure food safety, and stimulate energy efficiency, while improving ecological integrity and addressing legacy and emerging threats to public health and the environment, particularly with increased aquaculture production. Asia is the largest chemical-producing continent globally. Accordingly, sustainable and green chemistry and engineering present decided opportunities to stimulate innovation and realize a number of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Engaging the priority research questions identified herein will require transdisciplinary coordination through existing and nontraditional partnerships within and among countries and sectors. Answering these questions will not be easy but is necessary to achieve more sustainable environmental quality in Asia. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:1485–1505. © 2020 The Authors.

Urban expansion in the atlantic forest: Applying the nature futures framework to develop a conceptual model and future scenarios,"The Atlantic Forest is an important hotspot of biodiversity and ecosystem services that contributes to the well-being of its 125 million human inhabitants, about three quarters of the Brazilian population. In the coming decades, forecasts show that urban areas in the Atlantic Forest will grow at the expense of natural ecosystems, leading to increasing pressure on biodiversity and ecosystem services. We used the Nature Futures Framework (NFF) for envisioning positive scenarios for cities in the Atlantic Forest. First, we developed a conceptual model based on the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) approach to describe consequences of urban growth for the three NFF perspectives: Nature for Society, Nature for Nature and Nature as Culture. Second, we proposed scenario storylines that encompass multiple social-ecological values of nature and could be used by policy makers to plan desirable futures for the Atlantic Forest. Then, we discussed the impact of distinct policies on these values, identifying the different ways in which the management of urban green and blue spaces, natural ecosystems, and urban densities can lead to different social-ecological outcomes. We further detail the complexity, trade-offs, and synergies regarding city development, nature conservation, and human well-being in this tropical hotspot. Applying NFF can contribute to the ongoing debate regarding urban sustainability, by providing an interdisciplinary and integrative approach that explicitly incorporates multiple values of nature and the visualization of positive futures. © 2020, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

Spatial divergence in living standards during an economic growth phase in the periphery: A case study of North Karelia,"The advisability of an urban-centred growth strategy in sparsely populated parts of Europe has not been much analysed at micro-levels such as that of the postcode area. This paper investigates how regional disparities in living standards continued to increase during the technology-driven growth phase of 1993-2003, as exemplified by the case of North Karelia in Finland. Urban sprawl conveyed the spread effects of the rise in incomes, and the upsurge of living standards was concentrated in the neighbourhood of the provincial centre, Joensuu. Living standards faced a process of double divergence: between the central district of Joensuu and its commuter belt, and between the provincial core area and its hinterland, the latter consisting of rural areas and small towns dependent largely on natural resources. The spatial outcome of this socio-economic reorganization is a three-zone core-periphery pattern. As the economy grew, geographical shifts in wealth were consequences of the growth and mobility of certain social groups and strata. A wave of high living standards towards the outskirts of the provincial centre was generated by an expansion in commuting. The relative decline in living standards in the periphery was due to long-term rural decline and involved spatial restructuring.",Not About Sufficiency
"Conceptualizing the Urban Nexus Framework for a Circular Economy: Linking Energy, Water, Food, and Waste (EWFW) in Southeast-Asian cities","The global challenges of rapid urbanization, particularly dominant in fast-expanding cities in the Southeast-Asian region, include urban sprawl, inefficient infrastructure systems with energy black-outs, increased waste generation and air pollution. The “Urban Nexus” is here defined as an interrelated complex in which energy, water, food, and material flows/waste treatment systems intersect (EWFW, or, short, the “Nexus”). The Southeast-Asian Urban Nexus project, initiated by three significant organizations (including UN ESCAP), commenced in 2013 and is currently in its second phase. It aims to integrate resource management processes that increase the efficiency of natural resource use and infrastructural systems, transform planning practice, and reduce CO2 emissions and waste generation. The approach is based on the untapped inter-dependencies between the sectors, therefore looking holistically at the energy system as part of a multi-dimensional network and urban system that requires transformation, rather than understanding urban energy in an isolated single-purpose, single-sector linear way. One way to reduce energy consumption is to apply the principles of a Circular Economy. The Circular Economy model seeks to base economic development on environmental and resources protection. Hence, the Circular Economy and the Nexus are closely linked. The objective of the EWFW Nexus project is to provide an informed framework for determining trade-offs and synergies to meet future demand, while increasing urban resilience, resource efficiency, and green growth, without compromising safeguards for the environmental protection. This chapter presents progress to date, discusses three Nexus case studies, and informs readers about future Nexus work planned in four European cities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"Factors predicting innovation-decisions: The effects of performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions on U.S. Extension’s promotion of precision agriculture technologies","The human and social dimensions of knowledge transfer are essential to understand applied solutions for improving climate, land sustainability, and food production. The lack of knowledge and dissemination mechanisms of precision agriculture (PA) among agricultural Extension professionals hinder widespread PA adoption initiatives. Three theories were adapted to examine the comprehensive structural relationships between the factors affecting intentions to promote PA technologies. We surveyed 255 Extension agents and specialists from three U. S. states’ agricultural Extension systems with an instrument using six constructs measured as multi-item scales and demographic items. Data were analysed using SPSS 28.0 for descriptive and inferential statistics. The results indicated that Extension professionals were somewhat knowledgeable about PA but had low self-efficacy in promoting PA. In addition, a significant positive relationship existed between behavioural intention and performance expectancy, social influence, self-efficacy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions. Multiple regression results indicated that performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions significantly predicted behavioural intention to promote PA. The results underscore the importance of enhancing Extension professionals’ performance expectancy, social influence, and access to facilitating conditions to foster PA technology adoption. By addressing these key factors, stakeholders can develop strategic initiatives that not only improve PA knowledge transfer but also contribute to the broader goals of sustainable agricultural practices and the achievement of multiple Sustainable Development Goals. We recommend that future research can further evaluate and validate the key factors that have been identified as contributing to the dissemination of PA, thereby improving land sustainability and food security. © 2024 The Author(s).

Does mitigation shape adaptation? The urban climate mitigation-adaptation nexus,"Existing research has increasingly identified synergies and trade-offs between urban climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. There is a gap, however, in our knowledge of the extent to which urban climate change mitigation efforts affect the adoption of adaptation policies. Analysing the presence of different levels of climate change mitigation efforts in European cities, while also considering local climate risks and national adaptation mandates, our results show a positive and significant correlation between mitigation and adaptation policies. This is partly a result of the perceptions and discourses linking global and local climate risks, and partly a consequence of the co-benefits of the two activities at the local level, which enable cities to piggyback on their prior mitigation efforts when adopting adaptation policies. A conceptual ‘mitigation-adaptation nexus’ governance framework is adopted to improve the current synergy versus conflict debate. Multilevel logit regression analyses of 261 European cities, controlling for both city- and country-level factors, suggest that adaptation is positively influenced in cities with mitigation action policies with monitoring systems, rather than mere mitigation commitments. We also find that national mandates drive local adoption of adaptation policies. Key policy insights The mitigation-adaptation nexus approach enables cities to regard climate change policies not as single-dimensional, but as comprehensive capacity building efforts. Cities committed to actual progress on mitigation policy (i.e. with a monitoring system in place) are more likely to adopt adaptation policies. Cities are driven to join municipal adaptation networks on the basis of their established mitigation policies rather than local climate risk profiles. National adaptation mandates have an important influence on local climate planning. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency

Social vulnerability indicators as a sustainable planning tool,"In the face of global warming and environmental change, the conventional strategy of resource centralization will not be able to cope with a future of increasingly extreme climate events and related disasters. It may even contribute to inter-regional disparities as a result of these events. To promote sustainable development, this study offers a case study of developmental planning in Chiayi, Taiwan and a review of the relevant literature to propose a framework of social vulnerability indicators at the township level. The proposed framework can not only be used to measure the social vulnerability of individual townships in Chiayi, but also be used to capture the spatial developmental of Chiayi. Seventeen social vulnerability indicators provide information in five dimensions. Owing to limited access to relevant data, the values of only 13 indicators were calculated. By simply summarizing indicators without using weightings and by using zero-mean normalization to standardize the indicators, this study calculates social vulnerability scores for each township.To make social vulnerability indicators more useful, this study performs an overlay analysis of social vulnerability and patterns of risk associated with national disasters. The social vulnerability analysis draws on secondary data for 2012 from Taiwan's National Geographic Information System. The second layer of analysis consists of the flood potential ratings of the Taiwan Water Resources Agency as an index of biophysical vulnerability. The third layer consists of township-level administrative boundaries. Analytical results reveal that four out of the 18 townships in Chiayi not only are vulnerable to large-scale flooding during serious flood events, but also have the highest degree of social vulnerability. Administrative boundaries, on which social vulnerability is based, do not correspond precisely to ""cross-administrative boundaries,"" which are characteristics of the natural environment. This study adopts an exploratory approach that provides Chiayi and other government agencies with a foundation for sustainable strategic planning for environmental change. The final section offers four suggestions concerning the implications of social vulnerability for local development planning. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency

Asia’s Role in Governing Global Health,"In an era of rapid and extensive globalisation, the world faces a wide range of transboundary problems that require effective collective action. Key among these are threats to human health that do not recognise national borders, and include emerging and re-emerging infections, rising rates of chronic diseases, inadequate access to affordable and safe medicines, spreading anti-microbial resistance and the health effects of climate change. These threats require a transnational response and thus pose significant challenges to global health governance, as well as to long established notions of national sovereignty. This book investigates the neglected question of the impact of a rising Asia on the management of transboundary health problems. The chapters examine the role played by Asia in the governance of a range of global health issues, from development assistance in health, to global health instruments dealing with tobacco control and disease outbreaks, to health research and knowledge products, and the book concludes by examining the broad themes of a rising Asia’s role in the complexity of global health governance. The various analyses are tied together by a common focus on Asian countries’ use of the sovereignty principle, and seek to understand how traditional notions of national sovereignty can both clash with, and enhance, governance objectives in global health. In addition, the contributors examine the interaction between global, regional and domestic institutions, and present current ideas in Asia on the challenge of governing global health. With an inter-disciplinary approach that combines international relations, public policy and public health, this book will be invaluable to both scholars and policy makers working in these fields, as well as Asian politics, social policy and governance more generally. © 2013 Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental issues of groundwater in Korea: Implications for sustainable use,"Groundwater has been extensively exploited worldwide but is now confronted by a variety of problems, including groundwater depletion and contamination, that threaten its sustainable use as a clean water source. Groundwater is one of the major sources of water for domestic, agricultural and industrial uses, and provides 13% of the total annual water supply in Korea. Annual groundwater use has continuously increased from 2.57 billion m3 in 1994 to 3.72 billion m3 in 2007, of which 48.1% was consumed for domestic purposes. However, due to imprudent groundwater development and inappropriate management, Korea has confronted some critical groundwater problems, including extensive water level decline and quality deterioration caused by petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents. Among 193 national groundwater deep-monitoring wells nationwide, 62% showed decreasing water levels over the period 2004-2008. Soil and groundwater contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons was detected at a great number of military bases and public facilities, which drew national attention and complaints. The presence of high levels of radionuclides such as uranium and radon in groundwater has awakened controversy on their health effects. Increasing outbreaks of massive gastroenteritis were attributed to noroviruses in contaminated groundwater, and raised public health concerns. In addition, chlorinated solvents, especially trichloroethylene (TCE), have been frequently found in urban and industrial groundwaters, further adding to the burdens of environmental authorities. Consequently, these groundwater-related environmental issues have forced the Korean government and relevant authorities to urgently devise mitigation plans to secure a sustainable future use of groundwater resources. This paper provides details of the groundwater issues and implications for appropriate development and management. Copyright © 2011 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.",Not About Sufficiency
Global institutional choice,"The world faces collective action problems that are global in nature and scope, rendering nation states unable to achieve desired goods individually. Issues such as global climate change and systemic financial risk create externalities that impel the existence and intervention of a world government to avoid suboptimal market equilibria, free riding, and moral hazards. I submit the European Union's principle of subsidiarity as an organic, legitimizing framework for global governance that both compels and cabins a world government. Subsidiarity optimizes social welfare by enabling a world government to achieve desired goods that nation states would be otherwise unable to obtain individually because of collective action problems. But subsidiarity also limits a world government through a presumption in favor of local regulation as a matter of national autonomy and efficiency. The efficiency concern also enables subsidiarity to be an expansive principle for global governance because it accommodates both public and private forms of collective action. Public forms of collective action include public regulations, treaties between nations, and public institutions like the World Trade Organization. Private forms of collective action include free market Coasian bargaining between private parties and the efforts of private international institutions like Greenpeace. Because subsidiarity accounts for these diverse institutions in a large and complex world, it is an ideal balancing principle for global institutional choice. Copyright © 2010 by Frederick J.

Building national emission inventories of toxic pollutants in Europe,"The reduction of chemical pollution is a priority in many regional, national, and international policies, including in EU countries. To effectively do so, quantified overviews of pollutant emissions at national levels and with some granularity in their sources, are required. However, current monitoring efforts are often scattered and a quantitative and comprehensive inventory of toxic emissions in Europe is lacking. Toxic pollutants stem from a large variety of emission sources from industry, agriculture, households, etc. and the difficulty to cover all of them is manifest in public databases and official reports, where data gaps across countries and years exist for several substances. Here, we propose a methodology to tackle this problem and build comprehensive and harmonized national inventories of toxic pollutants. Using public databases, official reports, scientific literature and developing extrapolation techniques specific to each emission source, we derived harmonized annual inventories of toxic pollutants in all EU Member States over the years 2000–2014. They present an unprecedented coverage of 805, 572, and 468 substances emitted to air, water and soil, respectively. Although the resulting dataset shows a relatively good agreement with previous inventories of narrower scopes, uncertainties can be identified for specific emission sources and in the development of extrapolation techniques, thus calling for further research in these areas. Such efforts should also explore adaptation of the methodology to derive comprehensive inventories for countries outside EU, where data is scarcer. Nonetheless, the developed national inventories can provide a starting point for territorial chemical footprints of toxic pollutants and could be coupled with environmental impact assessment for gauging the damages to ecosystems and human health from toxic pollutants emitted in Europe. This can ultimately support policy-makers in their pollutants prioritisation and benchmarking across substances and countries towards improved toxic emission reduction policies. © 2019 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Integrating carbon management into the development strategies of urbanizing regions in Asia: Implications of urban function, form, and role","The way urbanization unfolds over the next few decades in the developing countries of Asia will have profound implications for sustainability. One of the more important opportunities is to guide urbanization along pathways that begin to uncouple these gains in well-being from rising levels of energy use. Increasing energy use for transport, construction, climate control in houses and offices, and industrial processes is often accompanied by increasing levels of atmospheric emissions that impact human health, ecosystem functions, and the climate system. Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry alter carbon stocks and fluxes as carbon dioxide, methane, and black carbon. In this article we explore how carbon management could be integrated into the development strategies of cities and urbanizing regions. In particular, we explore how changes in urban form, functions, and roles might alter the timing, aggregation, spatial distribution, and composition of carbon emissions. Our emphasis is on identifying system linkages and points of leverage. The study draws primarily on emission inventories and regional development histories carried out in the regions around the cities of Manila, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, New Delhi, and Chiang Mai. We find that how urban functions, such as mobility, shelter, and food, are provided has major implications for carbon emissions, and that each function is influenced by urban form and role in distinct ways. Our case studies highlight the need for major ""U-turns"" in urban policy. © 2007 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University.",Not About Sufficiency
The water footprint of coffee production icolombia,"The problem of water availability and its important role in the agricultural sector, specifically in the cultivation of coffee, which has historical, cultural, and economic importance for Colombia, requires a study of the water footprint in this country. This paper presents the results of a study of the water footprint of coffee production (cultivation and wet processing) in Colombia by the traditional and ecological wet-processing methods. To this purpose, the Water Footprint Network methodology was followed according to the Water Footprint Assessment Manual (2011). The green water footprint of coffee production in Colombia was 8,746 m3 t-1 and does not have a blue water footprint as it does not require irrigation, while the gray water footprint was 7,000 m3 t-1. When the traditional wet-processing method is used, the blue water footprint is 4 m3 t-1 and the gray water footprint is 3,200 m3 t-1, while if the ecological Becolsub® technology is used, the blue water footprint is 0.60 m3 t-1 and the gray water footprint is 1,739 m3 t-1. For the Ecomill® technology, the blue one is 0.55 m3 t-1 and had no gray water footprint because it does not generate any water discharge and the little leachate that it produces is reincorporated into the process. This implies that the Becolsub® ecological processing method reduces the water footprint by 45.7% and 99.9% with the ecological Ecomill® process (no wastewater discharge) compared to traditional wet processing technology. Compared to other countries, Vietnam has the lowest green footprint in coffee cultivation, followed by Colombia, Ethiopia, Brazil, Peru, and Indonesia. The water footprint of coffee depends on the climate and yields, consequently, the water footprint of the coffee crop varies significantly between locations and the evaluation period. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

African Handbook of Climate Change Adaptation: With 610 Figures and 361 Tables,"This open access book discusses current thinking and presents the main issues and challenges associated with climate change in Africa. It introduces evidences from studies and projects which show how climate change adaptation is being - and may continue to be successfully implemented in African countries. Thanks to its scope and wide range of themes surrounding climate change, the ambition is that this book will be a lead publication on the topic, which may be regularly updated and hence capture further works. Climate change is a major global challenge. However, some geographical regions are more severly affected than others. One of these regions is the African continent. Due to a combination of unfavourable socio-economic and meteorological conditions, African countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change and its impacts. The recently released IPCC special report “Global Warming of 1.5° C” outlines the fact that keeping global warming by the level of 1.5° C is possible, but also suggested that an increase by 2° C could lead to crises with crops (agriculture fed by rain could drop by 50% in some African countries by 2020) and livestock production, could damage water supplies and pose an additonal threat to coastal areas. The 5th Assessment Report produced by IPCC predicts that wheat may disappear from Africa by 2080, and that maize- a staple-will fall significantly in southern Africa. Also, arid and semi-arid lands are likely to increase by up to 8%, with severe ramifications for livelihoods, poverty eradication and meeting the SDGs. Pursuing appropriate adaptation strategies is thus vital, in order to address the current and future challenges posed by a changing climate. It is against this background that the “African Handbook of Climate Change Adaptation” is being published. It contains papers prepared by scholars, representatives from social movements, practitioners and members of governmental agencies, undertaking research and/or executing climate change projects in Africa, and working with communities across the African continent. Encompassing over 100 contribtions from across Africa, it is the most comprehensive publication on climate change adaptation in Africa ever produced. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
"Introducing experiences from African pastoralist communities to cope with climate change risks, hazards and extremes: Fostering poverty reduction","Pastoralist communities all over Africa have been facing a variety of social and economic problems, as well as climate risks and hazards for many years. They have also been suffering from climate change and extreme events, along with a variety of weather and climate threats, which pose many challenges to herders. On the one hand, pastoralist communities have little influence on policy decisions; however, on the other hand, they suffer to a significant extent from such policies, which limit their options for sustainable development and poverty alleviation. Also, the socio-cultural legacy of herders, and their role in food security and provision of ecosystem services, as well as their efforts towards climate change adaptation, are little documented, particularly in Eastern and Southern African countries. There is a perceived need for international studies on the risks and impacts of climate change and extreme events on the sustainability of pastoralist communities in Africa, especially in eastern and southern Africa. Based on the need to address this research gap, this paper describes the climate change risks and challenges that climate threats pose to the sustainability and livelihoods of pastoralist communities in eastern and southern Africa. Also, it discusses the extent to which such problems affect their well-being and income. Additionally, the paper reports on the socioeconomic vulnerability indices at country-level; identifies specific problems pastoralists face, and a variety of climate adaptation strategies to extreme events through field survey among pastoralist communities in a sample of five countries, namely Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. The study has shown that the long-term sustainability of the livelihoods of pastoral communities is currently endangered by climate change and the risks and hazards it brings about, which may worsen poverty among this social group. The study suggests that a more systematic and structured approach is needed when assessing the climate vulnerability of individual pastoral communities, since this may help in designing suitable disaster risk reduction strategies. Moreover, the paper shows that it is also necessary to understand better the socio-ecological systems (SES) of the various communities, and how their livelihoods are influenced by the changing conditions imposed by a changing climate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Interplay between land-use dynamics and changes in hydrological regime in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta,"Policies supporting rice production and investments in water infrastructure enabled intensification and diversification of farming systems in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) over the past 20 years. Yet, demands of food security, economic development, and climate change continue to pose diverging and often conflicting challenges for water resources management in the upper, central, and coastal zones of the delta. The major changes effected in the VMD's hydrological regime and land-use patterns are acknowledged in the literature, but few studies have examined the interplay between these dynamics at the delta scale. Based on time-series maps and statistical data on land-use, flooding, and salinity intrusion, we investigated the interrelations between land-use dynamics and changes in hydrological regime across the VMD in three representative periods. Land-use was found to be highly variable, changing by 14.94% annually between 2001 and 2012. Rice cropping underwent the greatest change, evolving from single cropping of traditional varieties towards double and triple cropping of high-yielding varieties. Aquaculture remained stable after rapid expansion in the 1990s and early 2000s. Meanwhile, flooding and salinity intrusion were increasingly controlled by hydrological infrastructure erected to supply freshwater for agriculture. Effects of this infrastructure became particularly evident from 2001 to 2012. During this period, spatial and temporal impacts on flooding and salinity intrusion were found, which extended beyond the rice fields to affect adjacent lands and livelihood activities. Unforeseen effects will likely be aggravated by climate change, suggesting a need to rethink the scale of planning towards a more integrated hydrologic approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Macroeconomic policy, growth, and biodiversity conservation","To successfully achieve biodiversity conservation, the amount of ecosystem structure available for economic production must be determined by, and subject to, conservation needs. As such, the scale of economic systems must remain within the limits imposed by the need to preserve critical ecosystems and the regenerative and waste assimilative capacities of the ecosphere. These limits are determined by biophysical criteria, yet macroeconomics involves the use of economic instruments designed to meet economic criteria that have no capacity to achieve biophysically based targets. Macroeconomic policy cannot, therefore, directly solve the biodiversity erosion crisis. Nevertheless, good macroeconomic policy is still important given that bad macroeconomy policy is likely to reduce human well-being and increase the likelihood of social upheaval that could undermine conservation efforts. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.",Not About Sufficiency

Is deforestation accelerating in the Brazilian Amazon?,"Recent studies suggest that deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon could increase sharply in the future as a result of over US$40 billion in planned investments in highway paving and major new infrastructure projects in the region. These studies have been challenged by several Brazilian ministries, which assert that recent improvements in environmental laws, enforcement and public attitudes have fundamentally reduced the threat posed to forests by such projects. The notion that hazards to Amazonian forests have declined over the last decade was assessed using available data on deforestation rates from 1978 to 2000. Although the alarmingly high rate of forest loss during 1978-1989 (1.98 million ha yr-1) declined somewhat in 1990-1994 (1.38 million ha yr-1), it rebounded to a high level in the period 1995-2000 (1.90 million ha yr-1). Moreover, correlation and regression analyses reveal that both absolute and per caput rates of forest loss accelerated significantly over the last decade. These trends fail to support the assertion that deforestation pressure in Amazonian forests has been brought under control. Poor enforcement of existing environmental laws, rapidly expanding logging and mining industries, increasing population pressure and other challenges are greatly hindering efforts to limit the environmental impacts of development activities in Brazilian Amazonia.",Not About Sufficiency
Why meta-regulation matters for public health: the case of the EU better regulation agenda,"Meta-regulation – the rules that govern how individual policies are developed and reviewed – has not received much attention in the study of health policy. We argue that these rules, far from value-free and objective, have significant potential to shape policy outputs and, as such, health outcomes. Channelling and operationalising wider paradigms like neoliberalism, they determine, for instance, what is considered ‘good’ policy, how decisions are made, based on which evidence, and whose voices matter. Exploring an archetypal example of meta-regulation, the European Union’s Better Regulation agenda, we illustrate why meta-regulatory tools such as impact assessment, stakeholder consultation, and evaluation – and the norms that underlie their application – matter for health. In so doing, we concentrate especially on the ways in which Better Regulation may affect interest groups’ ability to exert influence and, conversely, how actors have sought to shape Better Regulation. We argue that attention to meta-regulation contributes to counter-balancing the focus on agency within debates at the intersection of globalisation and health, and notably those on regulatory practices and coordination. Whilst research has noted, for instance, the origins of frameworks like Better Regulation and the increasing inclusion of 'good regulatory practice' provisions within trade and investment agreements, less attention is directed to the role that these frameworks play once institutionalised. Yet, as we illustrate, there is considerable scope for meta-regulation to enhance our understanding of the forces shaping health policy via, for instance, conceptualisations of the (social, economic, political, commercial) determinants of health. As such, we call for increased attention to the role of meta-regulation in research and practice aimed at improving human and planetary health. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Water security,"Climate change, as the dominant paradigm in natural resource policy, is obsolete and should be replaced by the water security paradigm. The climate change paradigm is obsolete because it fails to adequately resonate with the concerns of the general public and fails to integrate fundamental sustainability challenges related to economic development and population growth. The water security paradigm directly addresses the main reasons climate change ultimately matters to most people—droughts, floods, plagues, and wars. Additionally, this new proposed paradigm better integrates climate change concerns with other pressing global sustainability challenges—including that economic development and population growth will require 50% more food and energy and 30% more water by 2030 regardless of climate change. The water security paradigm orients all natural resource policies toward achieving a sustainable quantity and quality of water at acceptable costs and risks. Water security improves upon the climate change paradigm in several ways: it (1) replaces carbon footprints with water footprints as the metric for sustainability monitoring and reporting, (2) restructures natural resource governance at the watershed level with regional, rather than hierarchical, leadership, (3) integrates security and public health concerns into natural resource policies, (4) encourages investment in infrastructure for drought and flood resilience, and (5) facilitates the sustainable implementation of human rights. © 2017 by Rhett B.

Emerging solutions to the water challenges of an urbanizing world,"The top priorities for urban water sustainability include the provision of safe drinking water, wastewater handling for public health, and protection against flooding. However, rapidly aging infrastructure, population growth, and increasing urbanization call into question current urban water management strategies, especially in the fast-growing urban areas in Asia and Africa. We review innovative approaches in urban water management with the potential to provide locally adapted, resource-efficient alternative solutions. Promising examples include new concepts for stormwater drainage, increased water productivity, distributed or on-site treatment of wastewater, source separation of human waste, and institutional and organizational reforms. We conclude that there is an urgent need for major transdisciplinary efforts in research, policy, and practice to develop alternatives with implications for cities and aquatic ecosystems alike.",Not About Sufficiency
Water policy reforms in Algeria's agriculture: A review and prospects,"Since gaining independence in 1962, several policy reforms have been implemented in Algeria to address the challenges of water scarcity in agriculture. However, questions regarding the implementation and effectiveness of these policy reforms still abound today. The objective of this paper is to review Algeria's water policy reforms in agriculture, focusing on the historical, institutional, resource management, and pricing policy dimensions. The agricultural water sector in Algeria has passed through various stages of policy reform. The first historical stage (1962-1980) was characterized by a lack of institutions, poor water supply, and an absence of demand management strategies. The second stage (1980-1999) was characterized by institutional instability, a lack of accountability, and inadequate and ineffective water supply and demand management. The last stage (2000-present) is characterized by institutional strengthening, a supply-driven approach, and inefficient water management. Overall, the impact of water policy reform on Algerian agriculture, despite recent progress, has been almost negligible in terms of the efficiency and sustainability of its water resource management. Indeed, this review illustrates a gap between principles and practices in sustainable management of water resources. It is now critical that management practices should implement the principles of sustainable and integrated resource management. Priority should be given, but not limited, to the following: establishing coordination structures; developing technical and human capacity and resources at different levels of water management; deploying significant funding resources to sustain existing infrastructures and resources rather than to invest in new water infrastructures; developing a drought contingency plan involving water users; promoting and institutionalizing public-private partnerships; implementing water pricing based on cost recovery principles; enhancing decentralized governance of water resources; promoting participatory irrigation management; developing monitoring capacity for reliable data collection; integrating water management into urban policy planning and management; enhancing water productivity; and using unconventional resources. © 2011 WIT Press.",Not About Sufficiency
Global Economic Growth and Agricultural Land Conversion under Uncertain Productivity Improvements in Agriculture,"We study how stochasticity in the evolution of agricultural productivity interacts with economic and population growth at the global level. We use a two-sector Schumpeterian model of growth, in which a manufacturing sector produces the traditional consumption good and an agricultural sector produces food to sustain contemporaneous population. Agriculture demands land as an input, itself treated as a scarce form of capital. In our model both population and sectoral technological progress are endogenously determined, and key technological parameters of the model are structurally estimated using 1960-2010 data on world GDP, population, cropland and technological progress. Introducing random shocks to the evolution of total factor productivity in agriculture, we show that uncertainty optimally requires more land to be converted into agricultural use as a hedge against production shortages, and that it significantly affects both optimal consumption and population trajectories. © 2017 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of breadfruit in biocultural restoration and sustainability in Hawai'i,"The Hawaiian Islands today are faced with a complex mix of sustainability challenges regarding food systems. After European arrival, there was a change of dietary customs and decline in traditional Hawaiian agriculture along with the cultural mechanisms which sustained them. Recently, there has been a resurgence for local food and culture alongside an enthusiasm for breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis)-a Polynesian staple crop. To investigate the role of breadfruit and biocultural restoration in Hawai'i, we conducted surveys and interviews with local breadfruit producers. Overall, we found that breadfruit has the potential to provide holistic, practical and appropriate solutions to key issues in Hawai'i, including food security, environmental degradation and public health, while simultaneously lending to the revival of cultural norms and social relationships. As breadfruit cultivation expands rapidly in Hawai'i, the opportunities for increased social and environmental benefits can be realized if appropriately encouraged. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

"An Ecosystem Services Approach to Sustainable Livelihoods in the Homegardens of Kandy, Sri Lanka","The Kandyan homegardens, or forest gardens, of central Sri Lanka are diverse, smallholder agroforestry ecosystems that for 2000 years have reflected evolving environmental, economic, and social livelihood needs. An ecosystem services approach interrogated homegarden changes over the last 10 years in 31 Kandyan households. Livelihood strategies favouring homegardens were found to have broader benefits across household, national, and global scales than those favouring commercial simplification or those abandoning cultivation for alternative incomes. Livelihood benefits beyond income included resilience to economic and environmental shocks; food security; and higher stocks of biological and agricultural diversity. This revealed overlooked socio-ecological feedbacks between drivers that frustrated interventions to sustain homegarden livelihoods, including increased wild animal incursions thwarting household climate adaptation and disaster recovery; global organic and fair trade incentives reducing food security and livelihood resilience; and national seed and animal regulations counteracting homegarden sustainability programs. Despite these pressures, households maintained homegarden systems for their cultural, aesthetic and eating preferences. An ecosystem services approach can complement sustainable livelihood approaches by identifying overlooked environmental and cultural benefits; reveal livelihood feedbacks from drivers of ecosystem change; avoid unintended consequences from interventions; and capitalise on synergies between stakeholder priorities. © 2014 Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Transitions in pathways of human development and carbon emissions,"Countries are known to follow diverse pathways of life expectancy and carbon emissions, but little is known about factors driving these dynamics. In this letter we estimate the cross-sectional economic, demographic and geographic drivers of consumption-based carbon emissions. Using clustering techniques, countries are grouped according to their drivers, and analysed with respect to a criteria of one tonne of carbon emissions per capita and a life expectancy over 70 years (Goldemberg's Corner). Five clusters of countries are identified with distinct drivers and highly differentiated outcomes of life expectancy and carbon emissions. Representatives from four clusters intersect within Goldemberg's Corner, suggesting diverse combinations of drivers may still lead to sustainable outcomes, presenting many countries with an opportunity to follow a pathway towards low-carbon human development. By contrast, within Goldemberg's Corner, there are no countries from the core, wealthy consuming nations. These results reaffirm the need to address economic inequalities within international agreements for climate mitigation, but acknowledge plausible and accessible examples of low-carbon human development for countries that share similar underlying drivers of carbon emissions. In addition, we note differences in drivers between models of territorial and consumption-based carbon emissions, and discuss interesting exceptions to the drivers-based cluster analysis. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Measuring impact of financial inclusion on rural development through cooperatives,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to measure the impact of financial inclusion on rural development through cooperatives. Design/methodology/approach: The primary data were collected from 540 beneficiaries of Cooperatives banks operating in three northern states of India, i.e., J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab using purposive sampling during January to June 2016. Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, ANOVA, t-test and structural equation modelling were used for scale purification and data analysis. Findings: The findings of the study revealed that financial inclusion through cooperatives has direct and significant impact on rural development. Further, the results support the notion that financial inclusion is a strategy of inclusive growth, but inclusive growth itself is a subset of a larger set of inclusive development which means that the benefit must reach the all, particularly the women and the children, minority groups, the extremely poor and those pushed below the poverty line by natural and human-made disasters. Research limitations/implications: The research has certain inescapable limitations. First, the in-depth analysis of the study is restricted to three northern states of India only because of time and resource constraints. Second, the study is confined to the perception of financial inclusion beneficiaries only, which in future could be carried further on the perception of other stakeholders such as SHGs, banking correspondents, etc. Third, possibility of subjective interpretation in some cases cannot be ruled out. Originality/value: The study makes contribution towards financial inclusion literature relating to sustainable rural development and fulfils the research gap to some extent by assessing the impact of financial inclusion on rural development through cooperatives. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency

The soil–peace nexus: our common future,"The strong soil–peace link is governed by the need for finite, but essential, resources intricately connected with ecosystem services and functions. Access to adequate and nutritious food is essential to human wellbeing, peace and tranquillity. The relation between soil/environmental scarcity and conflict is complex, and security can only be universal, rather than local or regional, in the present era of globalization. Civil strife and conflict can be caused by both resource paucity and rapacity. Anthropogenic perturbations leading to soil degradation, climate volatility and growing human demands (e.g., food, energy, water, minerals) derived from soil are potential flash points triggering violence at local, regional and global scales. Among different types of drought, pedological and agronomic droughts are triggered by soil degradation, decline in available water capacity of the root zone and changes in the hydrological cycle. Several regions with unstable governments are prone to water scarcity and conflicts. Soil affects world peace through its impact on the quest for victuals, which enhances the relevance of the “Peak Soil” concept. Economic development and environmental enhancement must go hand in hand, and the highest priority must be given to development of the ecosphere. Depicting soil as a work of art for portraying cultural, aesthetical and ecological values can increase public awareness. A Greener Revolution can be ushered in through judicious soil and environmental governance. Maintaining peace and harmony necessitates that soil resources are used, improved, restored and never taken for granted. © 2015 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.",Not About Sufficiency
Mitigation Strategies of Heat Stress in Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) through Adjustment in Sowing Temperature and Application of Bio-regulators,"Global warming, as a result of climate change, may destructively affect wheat yield potentially increasing food insecurity and poverty. The field experiments were laid out during two consecutive rabi seasons of 2016–17 and 2017–18 at Sri Karan Narendra Agriculture University, Jobner, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, to enhance wheat growth, quality, and productivity. The present experiment consisted of three sowing at different thermal environments (22°C, 20°C and 18°C) in main plot and eight foliar sprays of bio-regulators (control, water spray, salicylic acid @ 100 ppm, salicylic acid @ 200 ppm, thiosalicylic acid @ 100 ppm, thiosalicylic acid @ 200 ppm, thioglycolic acid @ 100 ppm, and thioglycolic acid @ 200 ppm) in subplot were set in a split-plot design with four replications. The pooled data indicated that crops are sown at 20°C (D2) attained maximum growth parameters i.e. (total number of tillers per square meter and plant height), heat indices (GDD and CTD), quality parameters (chlorophyll content of flag leaf stage, crude protein content in grain and protein yield), and yield (grain, straw and biological), also proved significantly superior over D1 (sowing at 22°C) and D3 (sowing at 18°C). The data further indicated that the above parameters were measured significantly higher in B4 (SA @ 200 ppm), which excelled over rest of the treatments. Therefore, enhancement in yield requires improved agronomic practices i.e. application of SA @ 200 ppm along with crop sowing at 20°C temperature in order to sustain enhanced productivity under heat stress. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency

Science and Challenges for Cuban Public Health in the 21st Century,"Cuba’s public health outcomes are rooted in political and social phenomena that have favored achievement of health indicators well above expectations for an economy of its size.

This component should play an even greater role in meeting Cuba’s 21st century health challenges, especially the demographic and epidemiological transitions, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, rapid emergence of a complex-product biotechnology pharmacopoeia, greater molecular stratification of diseases, rising health costs, and the need to maintain communicable diseases under control in a global context of climate change and more population mobility.

The potential contribution of emerging economies to stop dangerous climate change. The case of Brazil,"Emerging economies are designing and sometimes implementing low GHG emission development strategies (LEDS) that can be used as examples by other developing countries to avoid the high-carbon development pathway established by industrialized countries. Using the example of Brazil, this Opinion Article discusses the need to design LEDS that are in line with the national resource endowment and political economy constraints. Brazil is very rich in natural resources with a huge potential for renewable energy deployment. Developed countries can compensate the lack of a similar resource endowment with technological and financial resources, while poorer countries will need technological transfers and financial support from the international community. On the other hand, Brazil is an oil producer and will need to carefully navigate the reduction in oil demand, driven by a global trend toward transport electrification, in order to avoid stranded assets. The article also discusses the need to choose the right instruments to overcome the economic, financial, and noneconomic barriers to mitigation options and achieve an economically and socially sustainable transition to a low carbon society. LEDS can be designed in a way that minimizes economic and social impacts if they are accompanied by policies aiming at a gradual reduction of inequalities, including governmental transfers to keep substantial social development gains, energy, and food security. LEDS can leverage each country's competitiveness while protecting the poor, and they can be made politically acceptable. If such policies are implemented quickly enough across the world, then it may be not too late to stop dangerous climate change.

Challenges in regional approaches: Lessons from Energy Poverty research in a small scale European member state,"Energy poverty is an issue now widely recognised for its detrimental impacts and research in Europe has intensified over the last decade. Many different methodologies of examining the topic have surfaced, with a common one being based on regional-based practices. Open source data are extremely useful for such approaches, because they offer unlimited access to information. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) is a framework for data collection on different geographic levels that provides different levels of statistical analysis for regions within a single country. It was set up in the 1970's by the European Union, and existing research work has already explored the valuable application of the NUTS system in certain areas. Nevertheless, the constraints of open source data (such as data based on NUTS regions), in reference to small scale member states, have not been exhaustively addressed. In this study the shortcomings of open source data are explored, by examining energy poverty in an area where the efficacy of the NUTS system is restricted. Cyprus is a member state in the European Union and is represented by a single NUTS category, for all levels of classification, unlike the majority of the rest. Data therefore exists only at the national level - something which contradicts the purpose of the different NUTS levels. In effect, for the case of Cyprus, this results in lack of differentiation among distinct climatic regions and disregarding the urban-rural dichotomy. It essentially renders this classification system inapt for Cyprus, while research activities become limited to the extent of data obtained through other means. Therefore, the study highlights the challenges researchers have to face when approaching a topic for Cyprus from a regional lens. To this end, geographical information systems software is used to observe a simplistic composite indicator of energy poverty in a medium-scale country (where NUTS is applicable), in relation to Cyprus. The effectiveness and potential impact of the outcomes in relation to public awareness, decision-making for policy makers and initiatives of local agents are examined and discussed. Ultimately, the study highlights that even when high quality indicators of energy poverty exist at the European Union level (Eurostat), under current circumstances they cannot be employed effectively to examine energy poverty regionally within Cyprus. Recommendations are proposed to overcome data access limitations in areas where popular open access databases are inadequate. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Using participatory videos in understanding farmers experiences with climate smart agricultural practices: reflections from Ghana,"Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has gained traction as one of the effective strategies in tackling the climate crisis. Many CSA practices have been promoted by development agencies to smallholder farmers based on the assumption that farmers would adopt these innovations for their potential benefits. However, the adoption of CSA practices in Ghana and much of Africa remains low and decision making and on-farm innovation processes are poorly understood. This study seeks to provide empirical and participatory insight into how smallholder farmers innovate. Based on a novel application of a participatory video methodology, in farming communities in the Upper West Region of Ghana, that have been exposed to multiple CSA intervention programmes, the paper analyses farmers’ own self-curated accounts of experiences with CSA innovation. The findings show that farmer’s motivation to adopt CSA innovations is driven by their concerns for food security, economic gains, and the environmental impact of climate change on their farming activities and livelihood. The study reveals a mismatch between the CSA technologies and practices advanced by the development agencies and what farmers perceive as relevant and important in addressing their farming challenges. In particular, the findings show that in a pool of more than 12 CSA technologies and practices that had been promoted through three donor-driven intervention programmes in the communities, farmers selected less labour intensive, less costly, and CSA technologies and practices that fitted to their current farming practices and the local context. Agricultural extension agents served as an important information source on the CSA innovation and their practical implementation and farmers’ social groups played a crucial role in facilitating learning about the CSA technologies and practices. There is the need to integrate farmers voices using innovative methodologies such as participatory videos to better understand farmers’ experiences in the innovation process which will help inform the design of effective interventions and promote adoption of innovations aimed at enhancing the productivity of smallholder farmers and reducing environmental impacts in African food systems. By focusing on the innovations that farmers perceive as beneficial and adaptable to their local contexts, development organizations can use their resources more efficiently and promote adoption of contextually appropriate CSA innovations.

Sustainable water future with global implications: Everyone's responsibility,"The current use and management of freshwater is not sustainable in many countries and regions of the world. If current trends are maintained, about two-thirds of the world's population will face moderate to severe water stress by 2025 compared to one-third at present. This water stress will hamper economic and social development unless action is taken to deal with the emerging problems. The Comprehensive Assessment of the Freshwater Resources of the World, prepared by the United Nations and the Stockholm Environment Institute, calls for immediate action to prevent further deterioration of freshwater resources. Although most problems related to water quantity and quality require national and regional solutions, only a global commitment can achieve the necessary agreement on principles, as well as financial means to attain sustainability. Due to the central and integrated role played by water in human activities, any measures taken need to incorporate a wide range of social, ecological and economic factors and needs. The Assessment thus addresses the many issues related to freshwater use, such as integrated land and water management at the watershed level, global food security, water supply and sanitation, ecosystem requirements, pollution, strengthening of major groups, and national water resource assessment capabilities and monitoring networks. Governments are urged to work towards a consensus regarding global principles and guidelines for integrated water management, and towards their implementation in local and regional water management situations. The alternative development options available to countries facing water stress, or the risk thereof, needs to be considered in all aspects of development planning. © 1997 United Nations.

Energy Policy Advancement: Climate Change Mitigation and International Environmental Justice,"This book states that sustainable development has become an influential discourse worldwide. Climate change is not only an urgent problem, but it is also a fundamental spiritual question concerning social justice and sustainable peace development as well as solidarity among people of various religious backgrounds and different countries. Thus, this global problem must be faced and recognized for future actions and strategies. However, the politics of fear must be replaced with a culture of peace, hope, and compassion, and this urgent problem must be faced with an optimistic attitude and a certain degree of preparedness. Climate change is evident in many forms, such as, for example, the most obvious—recent weather fluctuations that happen around the world. Floods, droughts, and hurricanes are those visible signs of climate change. Human-caused climate change is projected to greatly impact marine, freshwater, and terrestrial life. Temperatures in Alaska and the Arctic have increased over the last 50 years at a rate more than twice as fast as the global average temperature. Poor people are vulnerable to man-made climate change and respond rapidly to its impacts. Diverse knowledge of and approaches to climate change help understand this growing problem; global average air temperature has increased in the recent past by approximately 1.0°C (1.8°F). According to the Climate Science Special Report, the last several years have been record-breaking, and the period of 1901–2016 is the warmest. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are still rising, with damaging effects on the Earth’s climate. At the moment, the concentration of CO2 is higher than at any point in time—at least the past 800,000 years. However, carbon dioxide (CO2) is not the only GHG that impacts human-induced climate change. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Organisations and the sixth wave: Are ethics transforming our economies in the coming decades?,"The Kondratieff wave theory describes how societies develop in socio-economic waves of 40-60 years. The theory postulates a set of technologies and practices that are unique to each wave. Although a challenge of the Kondratieff wave theory is great variance in interpretations about the timing of the waves among scholars, based on several analyses we suggest that with the financial crisis of 2008, and resulting economic instability, we are experiencing the end of the fifth wave and the emergence of the sixth. We take as our starting point the global trends, particularly those of scarcity and the rising cost of commodities such as energy and raw materials that have led to a widely shared hypothesis that resource productivity will be the key driver of technology and economic growth in the next wave. Socially, this driver will be fortified by growing environmental concerns since climate change and the destruction of natural ecosystems seem inevitably to proceed. Both these sources are boosting a generation of new companies and behaviour. In this article our focus is to evaluate weak signals that point to possible directions for the future of organisational practices in the sixth Kondratieff wave. We ask what will be the effects of the changing socio-technical landscape on the working life and organisational culture. The K-waves theory explains how certain ways of organising that have so far developed in the fringes of organisational culture may move into the mainstream, as a product of the systemic restructuring that has often accompanied the new K-wave. We present our findings from a workshop with representatives of five different resource efficiency oriented organisations in the Silicon Valley area. Based on the data we have gathered through the workshop and complementing interviews, we show how organisations base their considerations about the future to a surprisingly large extent on ethical arguments. Our material also includes a case that shows that this ethical approach is not self-evidently related to the aim for resource efficiency. We evaluate our results in the Future Sign - framework presented by Hiltunen. The signals we have gathered are combined with corporate shared value - thinking, and both are interpreted through the Kondratieff - wave theory. Based on our sample of five cases, along with a framework that supports our interpretation, we suggest the ethical motivations as backbone of organisations is a relatively strong future sign that has potential for strengthening in the sixth wave context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

The importance of systems thinking in ethical and sustainable decision-making,"Ethical values beyond the satisfaction of basic human needs are specific to each society at a given time. Modern societies are confronted to the challenges of disappearing natural resources, fierce competition on global markets, and climate change. In this paper we define 'good', and at the same time 'ethical' decisions in the 21st century as being in accordance with the principles of Sustainable Development. Operations Research can assist sustainable decision-making in two ways: (1) through the tools of systems thinking, in particular system dynamics and soft system modelling, to provide insight into the way complex non-linear living systems and human societies function, and help making sustainable decisions, and (2) through educating and training young people in systems thinking. The paper presents examples of simple models that could serve in classrooms. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Not About Sufficiency
Role of artificial intelligence in the agricultural system,"In the economic sector, agriculture plays an important role. The biggest and emerging issue in the world is automation in agriculture. The population is increasingly rising, and the demand for food and jobs is also growing. These criteria were not fulfilled by the conventional methods used by farmers sufficient to satisfy them. New automated approaches have also been incorporated. These modern approaches have fulfilled food needs and have also provided billions of people with jobs. Artificial intelligence agriculture has brought about a revolution in agriculture. This technology has protected crop yield against many factors, such as climate change, population development, jobs, and food security issues. This chapter aims to explore various artificial intelligence applications, such as irrigation, weaving, sensor sprinkling, and other means in robots and drones, in agriculture. These technologies save excess water, pesticides, herbicides, preserve soil fertility, even lead to the efficient application of human resources and increase productivity and efficiency. This segment looks at several scientists' work to quickly overview the latest automation of agriculture, robotic weeding, and drone systems. The different soil water sensing methods and two automated weeding techniques are discussed. This chapter will also address drones' application and the various techniques used to spray drones and track crops. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
"Customary power, farmer strategies and the dynamics of access to protected forestlands for farming: Implications for Ghana's forest bioeconomy","In the last decade, multiple scientists and policymakers have been promoting bioeconomy for decarbonisation and as a way to tackle the ongoing socio-ecological crises. An effective transition to the bioeconomy in developing countries, which are predominantly agrarian,depends partly on its amenability to existing land access regimes and how actors in such countries are able to manage competing claims and needs associated with land use for biomass production. However, this is sparingly examined in the bioeconomy-politics literature. Using a case study from Ghana, a Global South context aspiring towards a forest-based bioeconomy, we analyze how overlapping legal and normative institutions mediate forest-dependent communities' access to lands in forest reserves for their food and other livelihood needs. The study found that state and traditional institutions are racing to sanction forest communities' access to forest reserve lands in order to consolidate their authority over the area. In the emerging bioeconomy, the state employs plantation forestry as a tool to consolidate its control. Concurrently, traditional authorities contend this by facilitating farmers' access to the same area for cocoa production to establish claims to the land. Amid this contest, forest communities have constructed a robust discourse centred on their ‘right to food’, enabling them to apply their rich local knowledge to cultivate food and cash crops in forest reserves without deference to state institutions and traditional authorities. State forestry officials react by cutting down these ‘illegal farms’, causing periodic food insecurity in the study localities. Some farmers respond by adapting their access mechanisms, cultivating deeper into the reserve to evade forestry officials. The dynamism of this conflict makes sustainable resource use challenging in the study localities. But it also indicates that without proper safeguards and a coherent rural development policy, the bioeconomy will become an approach for reproducing oppressive land accumulation, impeding forest communities ability to address their food and livelihood needs. Thus, while the findings bring to date the growing struggle over land in Sub-Saharan Africa, it cautions that governments need to recognize that the bioeconomy, despite its promise of sustainability, is no quick fix for entrenched structural problems in rural Africa. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Confronting the nexus of climate change: Mental health, food security, and social stability","Climate change poses a significant risk to global public health, with comparatively limited attention given to its effects on mental health in scientific studies. Moreover, an absence of agreement exists on the impacts of climate change on those who possess preexisting mental health conditions. This chapter aimed to determine the health effects of climate change, particularly for people with existing mental health disorders. Several literature evaluations were performed to determine how climate change affects food security, how that affects human health, and how to spot weaknesses in the food system. The evidence implies that the food system's most crucial activities are at risk from global warming. The effects of climate change on food security and its major determinants on human health are difficult to trace because of the interconnectedness of the food system's many components. Food insecurity is a major contributor to people's health, and climate change is a major threat to the food supply chain. Physical consequences of climate change on the food chain may also directly affect human health, particularly the effects on nutrition and foodborne infections. This study offers a new approach to assessing the relationships between climate change, food poverty, and human health. This work aims to aid public health professionals, academics, and other interested parties in their pursuit of knowledge about present and potential threats to human health and guide adaptation initiatives aimed at mitigating those threats. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Role of corporate sustainability disclosures in moderating the impact of country-level uncertainties on tourism sector firms’ risk,"The study investigates the role of corporate sustainability disclosures in moderating the link between country-level uncertainties (economic policy uncertainty, political uncertainty and uncertainty due to climate change) and firms’ risks (total risk, market risk, and default risk) in the worldwide tourism firms. We consider the volume of ESG (environmental, social and governance) activities disclosures by the firms as a proxy of corporate sustainability disclosures. The study also explores the link between sustainability disclosures and firms’ risks to validate the risk-reduction hypothesis. The study further highlights the relevance of country-level uncertainties in increasing firms’ risks. The findings indicate that corporate sustainability disclosures can assist in mitigating tourism firms’ risks during periods of heightened country-level uncertainties. The study also documents the significance of sustainability disclosures in reducing the effect of uncertainties on tourism firms’ risks during the COVID-19 period. The results validate the risk-reduction hypothesis indicating that firms’ engagement in corporate sustainability practices facilitates risk mitigation efforts during periods of escalated external uncertainties. By demonstrating that firms that engage in sustainability practices and provide required disclosures are better equipped to manage risks during periods of increased uncertainty, the study provides valuable insights for industry stakeholders, including investors, policymakers, and firms themselves. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"Climate Change, a Strong Threat to Food Security in India: With Special Reference to Gujarat","Gujarat contributes to around 16% of industrial and 12% of agricultural production in India (GoI, India: greenhouse gas emissions 2007. Technical report. Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, New Delhi, 2010b). The Government of Gujarat acknowledges that Climate Change is not just a threat to the environment; it has profound implications for economic expansion, social progress, and nearly all other aspects of human wellbeing (Grafton et al., Nat Clim Chang 3:315–321, 2013). A Department of Climate Change has been established by the government of Gujarat to deal with climate change (GoI, Twelfth five year plan (2012–2017). Economic sectors. Government of India, New Delhi, 2013). It includes Missions on Solar Energy, Augmented Power Efficiency, Resilient Ecosystems, Water, Green procurement India, Climate resilient Agriculture, and Collaborative Knowledge for Climate Change (Bring et al., Earth’s Future 3:206–217, 2015). The state of Gujarat has put in place a variety of policies and programs to address some of the issues associated with Climate Change while also assuring the attainment of sustainable development goals (Doll and Bunn, The impact of climate change on freshwater ecosystems due to altered river flow regimes. In: Climate change 2014. Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, pp 143–146, 2014). Efforts are being taken to make farming more environmentally friendly, like setting up agro-meteorological field stations, setting up automatic weather stations, and studying Climate Change in State agriculture universities (Douglas et al., Glob Planet Chang 67:117–128, 2009). According to the Department of Agriculture, Gujarat, about 51% of the state’s land is used for farming. Agriculture makes up about 18.3% of India’s most populous state’s GDP (GoI, Climate change and India: a 44 assessment a sectoral and regional analysis for 2030s. Technical report. Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, New Delhi, 2010a). Despite the Government’s efforts to address climate change, challenges persist. Agriculture in India faces numerous difficulties, one of which includes environmental unpredictability (Gosling et al., Hydrol Earth Syst Sci 7:279–294, 2011). A report from the IPCC says that by 2080–2100, India could lose 10%–40% of its crop production due to climate change. The cumulative result is expected to be a reduction in the viability of terrain for agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions. Salt concentrations’ infiltration is an issue in Gujarat due to its lengthy shoreline (Garduno et al., India groundwater governance case study. Technical report. World Bank, Washington, DC, 2011). An increase in CO2 will increase the output of rice, wheat, legumes, and oilseeds by 10–20%. With each degree Celsius increase in temperature, yields of grains such as wheat, soybeans, mustard, peanuts, and potato are expected to fall by 3%–7%. There is a probability that yields of chickpeas, rabi, maize, millets, and coconuts will increase on the west coast of India (Hsu et al., J Geophys Res Atmos 118:1247–1260, 2013). In particular, to the state of Gujarat, there are not nearly enough data on the impacts of climate change on agriculture. It is anticipated that irrigated rice production in some parts of Gujarat will go down by 2030 (Gordon et al., Natl Acad Sci 102:7612–7617, 2005). According to the most recent available information, climate change will almost certainly result in more people at threat of going hungry. In 2080, the number of people who are not well-fed could rise by 5%–26% because of climate change. Agriculture, according to some assessments, is likely to be impacted in coastal regions since agriculturally productive areas are subject to flooding and soil salinity (Ghose, J Sci Ind Res 60:40–47, 2001). Climate change will have different impacts on food security in different regions of the state of Gujarat. Climate change will make it more difficult for people living in poor socio-economic regions to get their food and make food insecurity even more important (Hoff, Understanding the nexus. Background paper for the Bonn 2011. Stockholm Environment Institute, Stockholm, 2011). The future policy environment will have a significant impact on the long-term effects of climate change (GRDC, Long-term mean monthly discharges and annual characteristics of GRDC stations/online provided by the Global Runoff Data Centre of WMO 3 19. http://www.bafg.de/GRDC/EN/01_GRDC/grdc_node.html, 2020). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of sustainability index for rural water management using ANN,"The current study proposes a sustainability index (SI) measure based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and globally accepted parameters. Some of the available methods for SI measurement are multi-criteria analysis, external costs, energy analysis, and ecological footprint methods. However, validity remains a concern due to a system's needs, criteria, and requirements. Generally, sustainability is assessed in economic, environmental, and social issues, which varies across regions and countries. Most of the studies accept sub-indices but to a limited extent. Therefore, the proposed study develops an SI evaluation method based on the idea of multi-sustainability incorporating operations, institutions, risks, and climate factors besides economic, environmental, and social issues. All these issues might not be applicable to a single project but may help to develop a complete index when applied. The present study considered different scenarios in building a method to calculate SI using ANN. The results obtained by the ANN model for various input parameters helped to identify the best water conservation strategy. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the uncertainty contribution/significance of the input variables for the water scarcity in the study region. The developed model in the study is tested on a rural water management system. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Reclamation of salt-affected soils in India: Progress, emerging challenges, and future strategies","India is facing economic losses of $US ~ 3.0 billion annually due to the existence of ~ 6.73 million ha of un-reclaimed salt-affected soils (SASs). The losses may go up significantly as future projections indicate an increase in the area of SASs to the extent of ~16 million ha by 2050, due to the impact of faulty irrigation practices and climate change. Managing the SASs is one of the major challenges in achieving land degradation neutrality, increasing crop productivity, and sustaining food security in India. Although the problem of SASs has been reduced to some extent through various technological interventions yet further efforts are needed for developing new avenues to further improve the productivity and restrict the expansion of salinity to new areas. The major interventions including application of various ameliorants, growing salt-tolerant crops and cultivars, installation of sub-surface drainage, adoption of alternate land-use systems, and use of land shaping techniques have made significant impact nation-wide in term of reclamation and productivity enhancement. Despite the achieved success in restoring the productivity of SASs, several constraints at the regional and national level have plagued the reclamation progress. The objective of this review is to compile relevant information available on the use and success of technological interventions to restore SASs. The emerging challenges, and the strategies that would be needed to address the problem of SASs in India are also discussed. This review may help India achieve the Sustainable Development Goals outlined by the UN for land degradation neutrality and food security. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Social Innovation for Agricultural Development: A Study of System of Rice Intensification in Bihar, India","The social innovation inclines to an emphasis on ‘systems and processes of change in social relations’ and ‘innovation is a new idea, product or process that addresses social and environmental challenges and their needs’. It is newly growing up as a field of practice that is done by people. It has occurred from the broader field of innovation studies. In this article, the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) has been taken as a case of social innovation, which helps to increase the productivity of rice and enhance the income of the farmers. The literature related to SRI suggested that the technique is sustainable and innovative because of the less use of inputs and changes in some set of principles (i.e., planting, fertilizer, water and seeds) whereas increasing output in terms of production and productivity of the crop. In this sense, aim of the article is to evaluate the impact of the SRI technique within the framework of social innovation in Patna district, Bihar, India. In a wider context, the question is not about whether it is intensifying or not, rather emphasis should be on how farmers deal with changing environmental and socio-economic factors. Moreover, there is a need to delve deeper into implantation strategies in the local context and evaluate their impact in terms of opportunities and constraints during adaptation. In addition to this, an exploratory research design was followed to study SRI. Criterion and expert sampling were employed to select the farmers, and data were collected by a personal interview method with the help of a structured schedule. However, the data indicate the production and productivity of paddy are increased through SRI, but variation exists among different blocks of the district. It is clearly evident from the data that nearly 42 per cent of farmers from all blocks have witnessed an increase in food sufficiency. In the case of income due to the sale of excess produce is 57 per cent. © 2020 Association of Asia Scholars.",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of crop establishment methods on rice insect pests incidence in Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP),"Rice (Oryza sativa L.), is the staple food for more than half of the world population and an important target to secure food security and livelihoods for millions. The production of rice to mitigate the consumption requirement needs huge amount of water. Direct seeded rice (DSR) technique is becoming popular nowadays because of its low-input demands and potential to maximize the water productivity under deficit soil moisture. Rice variety, Pusa 1121 is important variety in major rice growing areas of Indo Gangetic Plain that occupies more than 70% area. The population of planthoppers and stem borers were significantly higher and appeared early in direct seeding crop as compared with transplanted rice (TPR). The mean seasonal incidence of stem borers in 2014 were 9.58 and 5.29% in direct seeding whereas in 2015 it was 9.36 and 4.97%. The damage (white ears) was observed maximum on 42nd week in October. The result revealed that incidence of leaffolder was significantly higher in direct seeding than transplanting. The population/ incidence of pests showed positively significant correlation with biotic factors during the study. The grain yield in transplanting crop was also significantly higher than direct seeding. So, management practices in direct seeding should be practiced earlier as compared to transplanted rice to maximize yield by reducing pest population pressure for sustainable agriculture and to conserve natural resources. © 2019 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

Nature's contributions to people and biodiversity mapping in switzerland: Spatial patterns and environmental drivers,"Changes in climate and land use represent significant risks of biodiversity loss globally, affect ecological stability, impact nature's contributions to people (NCP, i.e. ecosystem services) and compromise human livelihood. As framings of conservation evolve to consider the interdependence between species and human needs, there is a growing recognition of the importance of NCP and biodiversity in conservation actions. However, knowledge on the interactions and spatial repartition of NCP and biodiversity remains limited. Here we show a comprehensive spatial assessment for 15 NCP and one biodiversity – distribution of threatened species – indicators in Switzerland. Indicators values were computed using a panel of mapping and modelling methods extracted from the literature, or specifically developed for this study. Through the analysis of their relationships, we reveal significant trade-offs and synergies in the spatial repartition of these indicators. Results from a spatial bundle analysis performed on the 16 indicators revealed the existence of four bundles showing a heterogeneous repartition over the Swiss landscape. Furthermore, we identified that topography (slope), climate (temperature and precipitations), and habitat (forest and meadows) were among the most influential factors to explain the spatial distribution of the four bundles. We conclude that various significant relationships exist between NCP and biodiversity indicators in Switzerland, emphasizing the importance of informed conservation approaches considering both NCP and biodiversity supply. This work helps fill the gap in our understanding of the links among different NCP, between NCP and biodiversity, and highlight their relationship to climate and land use, providing key insights for optimizing conservation efforts. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Dynamic Evolution and Scenario Simulation of Ecosystem Services under the Impact of Land-Use Change in an Arid Inland River Basin in Xinjiang, China","Ecosystem services (ESs) are crucial for sustainable development, as they impact human well-being. However, changes in land use/land cover (LULC) caused by climate change and social development can negatively affect ESs, particularly in arid river basins. This study focuses on current and future changes in LULC in the Kaxghar River Basin (KRB) in Xinjiang, China, to determine how these changes will affect the region’s ESs. The integrated PLUS-InVEST model was used to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution and changing patterns of habitat quality (HQ) and carbon storage (CS) under the natural increase scenario (NIS), economic development scenario (EDS), and water protection scenario (WPS). Additionally, the Ecosystem Service Contribution Index (ESCI) was also calculated to evaluate the contribution of LULC changes to ESs. The results show the following: (1) from 2000 to 2020, the average value of HQ in the KRB gradually decreased from 0.54 to 0.49 and CS trended slightly upward, with a total increase of 0.07 × 106 t. Furthermore, the changes in CS were highly consistent with changes in LULC. (2) From 2020 to 2030, the area of low-grade (0–0.2) HQ saw a continuous increase, with the fastest growth occurring in 2030 under the EDS. Meanwhile, under the WPS, HQ significantly improved, expanding by 1238 km2 in area. Total CS under the three test scenarios tended to decline, with the NIS showing the smallest decrease. (3) The expansion of cropland and unused land had a negative impact on ESs, particularly on CS, whereas the conversion to grassland and forestland had a significant positive impact. In conclusion, these insights will enrich our understanding of ESs in the study area and contribute to balancing the relationship between ecological conservation and socioeconomic development in the Kaxghar River Basin, as well as in other parts of China’s arid Northwest and similar regions around the world. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Poverty targeting, resource degradation and heterogeneous endowments - A micro-simulation analysis of a less-favored Ethiopian village","Persistent and widespread poverty in less-favored areas (LFAs) is attributed to fragile natural resources and poor markets. Limited assets may keep households outside the reach of poverty policies targeted at LFAs. We explored in a stylized manner the role of heterogeneous household assets for (1) policies aimed at poverty reduction; (2) within-village income inequality; and (3) soil erosion. With a farm-household micro-simulation model we analyzed for each household in a remote Ethiopian village three sets of policies: technology improvement, infrastructure investment, and off-farm employment through migration or cash for work (CFW) programs. Combating poverty with a single policy, migratory off-farm employment reduces the poverty headcount most. Because of self-selection, CFW programs performed best in terms of reaching the poorest of the poor. CFW also reduced within-village income inequality most, while a price band reduction increased income inequality. Only technology improvements resulted in a trade-off between poverty and soil erosion. Price band and off-farm employment policies reduced erosion while outperforming technology improvements in terms of poverty reduction. We found that combining two policies was most helpful in assisting poorer households to overcome the limitations of their asset endowments. A CFW program combined with reduced price bands yielded most in terms of poverty reduction and income inequality. This policy complementarity is, however, less important for better-endowed households. Reducing the reliance of households on agriculture offered a win-win situation of reducing poverty and maintaining natural resources. Combining policies helped to overcome asset limitations, to target policies to the poorest households and to reduce income inequalities. © 2007 International Association of Agricultural Economists.",Not About Sufficiency

"Urban green space: creating a triple win for environmental sustainability, health, and health equity through behavior change","Urbanization, costs of green space maintenance, and diminishing connection between people and nature all exert pressures on urban green space. This is regrettable as green space has the potential to create wins for environmental sustainability, health, and health equity. This paper explores this potential triple win and investigates how to increase the use of urban green space through behavior change. A narrative literature review was conducted and was supplemented with literature suggested by experts. Results show that creating well-designed green spaces and stimulating people to use them can indeed deliver this triple win. Providing accessible, attractive, well-maintained green space with room for socialization, and where people feel safe, may increase the opportunity and motivation of people to use it more often. Informing and educating people and organizing activities may increase capability (and motivation) to use green space. Since the use of green space depends on life stage, lifestyle factors and individual values, it is important to involve potential users in its design. We recommend a specific focus on those groups who may benefit most from the use of green space. More evaluation is needed to inform effective green space interventions and to assess related economic, social, and environmental benefits. © 2019 by the authors.

A new war on nature and people: taking stock of the Colombian peace agreement,"Non-technical summary Almost 6 years have passed since the Colombian peace agreement was signed. However, the promise of a 'Stable and lasting peace' is slipping away as the transition towards peace is increasingly tainted and overshadowed with violence. The future of Colombia is at a crossroad and without international support and action taken to monitor global supply chains, these particular drivers of conflict, violence and environmental degradation will persist. We summarize the current situation and shed light on the complexities of building peace in Colombia, with a particular focus on the environmental changes that took place since the peace agreement was signed. Technical summary The Colombian peace agreement officially ended one of the world's longest internal armed conflicts. But the transformation of land use that takes place in the wake of the peace agreement has made the historic inequalities of access to land more visible and revealed inherent and violent struggles over resources that persist across the country. In this briefing we analyse the current status of peacebuilding in Colombia and highlight the major barriers and challenges in the current peacebuilding efforts. We show how the last few years brought severe and negative repercussions for people, communities and the natural environment in Colombia as cattle ranching, 'productive agriculture' and extractive industries are increasingly encroaching into indigenous territories, protected areas and forest ecosystems, replacing diverse natural forests that support biodiversity and contribute to human well-being locally and globally. The resurging presence of numerous armed groups seeking to control the profitable drug trade and mineral deposits are a major problem and obstacle for building lasting and sustainable peace among people and with the natural environment in Colombia. We conclude this briefing with points that we see as crucial to support the implementation of the peace agreement.

Comparative cradle to grave environmental life cycle assessment of traditional and extensive vegetative roofs: an application for the Lebanese context,"Purpose: Vegetative roofs (VRs) are fully planted roof spaces that offer aesthetic view, storm water management, sound insulation, energy savings, and air improvement. The aim on this work is to compare the life cycle environmental impacts of traditional gravel ballasted roof (TGBR) and extensive green roof (EGR) each having a surface area of 650 m2. Methods: Environmental impacts were determined and analyzed using a cradle to grave life cycle assessment (LCA) including two end-of-life scenarios (landfilling and recycling). In particular, for the use phase, the updated Lebanese electricity grid was integrated for the first time in the LCA software SimaPro and real-time temperature monitoring for TGBR and EGR roof mockups that were installed on the rooftop of the Chemical Engineering Building at the University of Balamand-Lebanon were used. Life cycle impact assessment was performed using the IMPACT 2002+ methodology for all impact categories except for water scarcity, which was determined from the water use in life cycle assessment (WULCA) consensus model. Results and discussion: Results demonstrated that the assembly and the use phase were the highest contributors to the environmental impacts for TGBR and EGR. Comparing the two types of roofs, TGBR had the highest contribution for all impact categories except for “land occupation.” This is justified by the presence of the vegetation layer in the vegetative roofs. Conclusions: EGRs are more efficient than TGBR from an environmental perspective. Moreover, increasing the share of renewable energy in the total Lebanese energy production will lower greenhouse gases emissions from the energy sector and the other life cycle environmental impacts. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Asymmetric Effects of Economic Policy Uncertainty on Food Security in Nigeria,"This study investigates the asymmetric effects of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on food security in Nigeria, utilizing annual time series data from 1970 to 2021. The study used descriptive statistics, unit root tests, the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model and its associated Bounds tests to analyze the data. The analysis reveals that adult population, environmental degradation, exchange rate uncertainty (EXRU), financial deepening, food security (FS), government expenditure in agriculture uncertainty (GEAU), inflation, and interest rate uncertainty (INRU) exhibit positive mean values over the period, with varying degrees of volatility. Cointegration tests indicate a long-term relationship between EPU variables (GEAU, INRU, and EXRU) and food security. The study finds that cumulative positive and negative EPU variables have significant effects on food security in the short run. Specifically, negative GEAU, positive INRU, positive and negative EXRU have significant effects in the short run. In the long run, negative GEAU, positive and negative EXRU have significant effects on food security. Additionally, the research highlights asymmetric effects, showing that the influence of GEAU and EXRU on food security differs in the short- and long-run. The study underscores the importance of increased government expenditure on agriculture, control of exchange rate and interest rate uncertainty, and the reduction in economic policy uncertainty to mitigate risks in the agricultural sector and enhance food security. Recommendations include strategies to stabilize exchange rates to safeguard food supply and overall food security. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable Palm Oil? Insights from Material Flow and Land Use Analysis in Brazil’s Production Hotspot,"Negative impacts of plantation agriculture were widely recognized when the expansion of palm oil production began in Brazil. In 2010, president Lula da Silva initiated a program to foster socially and environmentally sustainable palm oil production. Our research in Brazil’s palm oil production hotspot Tomé-Açu, Pará, leads us to question the success of this program. Based on data-driven analysis of material and land use and qualitative field research, we reveal unsustainable biophysical patterns and drivers of plantation expansion. In particular, we identify functional links between deforestation, pursuant use of land for cattle ranching, and (perceived) availability of plantation land. By considering the direct and indirect material and land use effects of palm oil production, we find that deforestation sustainability programs seek to avoid remains a prerequisite to plantation expansion. Material and land use patterns shape not only the biophysical but also the economic basis of rural livelihoods with implications for the environmental and the social sustainability of any further expansion of palm oil production. ©2017 C.

Regional impact assessment of land use scenarios in developing countries using the FoPIA approach: Findings from five case studies,"The impact of land use changes on sustainable development is of increasing interest in many regions of the world. This study aimed to test the transferability of the Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment (FoPIA), which was originally developed in the European context, to developing countries, in which lack of data often prevents the use of data-driven impact assessment methods. The core aspect of FoPIA is the stakeholder-based assessment of alternative land use scenarios. Scenario impacts on regional sustainability are assessed by using a set of nine regional land use functions (LUFs), which equally cover the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The cases analysed in this study include (1) the alternative spatial planning policies around the Merapi volcano and surrounding areas of Yogyakarta City, Indonesia; (2) the large-scale afforestation of agricultural areas to reduce soil erosion in Guyuan, China; (3) the expansion of soil and water conservation measures in the Oum Zessar watershed, Tunisia; (4) the agricultural intensification and the potential for organic agriculture in Bijapur, India; and (5) the land degradation and land conflicts resulting from land division and privatisation in Narok, Kenya. All five regions are characterised by population growth, partially combined with considerable economic development, environmental degradation problems and social conflicts. Implications of the regional scenario impacts as well as methodological aspects are discussed. Overall, FoPIA proved to be a useful tool for diagnosing regional human-environment interactions and for supporting the communication and social learning process among different stakeholder groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Strategies for Knowledge Sharing Among Rice Farmers: A Ghanaian Perspective,"Purpose: This article investigates knowledge sharing practices amongst rice farmers in Ghana and suggests a strategy for improving knowledge sharing in rice farming communities in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: This study is underpinned by the pragmatic paradigm where concurrent triangulation mixed-method design was used for the study. Data was gathered with survey and interviews. A total sample of 110 was used, involving 101 survey respondents and 9 interview participants. The survey data was analyse descriptively using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 26. The interview finding was analysed using thematic analysis. The findings revealed informal knowledge sharing practices among the rice farmers and suggests a strategy for knowledge sharing that involve partnerships between stakeholders in different sectors, such as government agencies, rice-farming communities; rice production-based NGOs, and researchers. Successful implementation of knowledge sharing would depend on finding and connecting the tools, technologies, and techniques practices. Limitations: The results could not be generalised to knowledge sharing practices among rice framers in Ghana because only three regions were targeted. There is a need for a quantitative comparative study of knowledge sharing by rice farmers in all regions where rice is produced in Ghana. Practical Implications: Rice is an agricultural cereal crop in Ghana and an important source of livelihood for rural poor households. It is consumed and cultivated by many people in the country. When rice farmers engage in efficient knowledge sharing practises knowledge will spread easily among rice farming communities resulting in sustainable agricultural practices that may eradicate hunger and poverty Effective knowledge sharing, offers great potential for addressing the challenges of rice production in Ghana. It will increase rice production, improve the quality of rice yield and safeguard the quality of the natural environment simultaneous. Originality/Value: This article adds to the body of knowledge on knowledge sharing from an agricultural perspective with specific reference to rice farming. Effective knowledge sharing will enhance food security, alleviate climate change challenges, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture, thus contributing toward the realisation of Goal 2 of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The findings of this article form part of the finding of the doctoral studies. © 2023 Academic Publishing International. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Transferring awareness into action: A meta-analysis of the behavioral drivers of energy transitions in Germany, Austria, Finland, Morocco, Jordan and Iran","Energy transition is a so-called wicked policy problem which requires involvement of stakeholders and laypeople. This support should go beyond social acceptance, which is a rather passive attitude, and should include social factors such as willingness to participate in energy transition and willingness to use renewable energy sources. However, moving from awareness to action is a complex process and requires understanding of social factors. Until recently scientific research was mainly focused on technical and economic factors of energy transition however the volume of scientific results published by social science energy research is growing. The focus of this paper is on how people are making choices and which factors are influencing their choices. Research based on social sciences and behavioral economics shows preferences and rationalities of people when it comes to the question of available in frames of energy transition alternatives. The results of this paper are based on large-scale surveys, decision-making experiments and interviews conducted in Germany, Austria, Finland, Morocco, Jordan and Iran. The results show high level of awareness about the need of climate change mitigation across countries, which is decreasing with the level of details about the projects or the energy transition processes. The results also show dominance of economic rationality with concerns about energy prices and socio-economic impacts from energy transition over other concerns such as environmental protection. Also, such factors as maintenance and reparation of technology and possibility to participate in decision-making processes have impact on willingness to support energy transition which goes beyond social acceptance. © 2020 The Author",Not About Sufficiency
The Water Supply Infrastructure of Early Denver,"The City of Denver originated as a gold-mining town. Its geographic location and semi-arid environment posed unique challenges to the development of its water supply infrastructure. Multi-scalar historical and archeological analyses, reveal how the city coped with the challenges of water scarcity and distribution over time, illustrating the evolution of water management practices, and the ways in which infrastructure and governance systems evolved to meet changing needs and priorities. Historical analysis maps the changes in urban water infrastructure (cisterns, ditches, sewers, artesian wells, and reservoirs) using a systematic documentation review of the Denver newspaper citations between 1860 and 1929. This is corroborated through contextual investigation and archeological excavations. Taken together, the research demonstrates how the residents of early Denver were forced to continually seek new water sources for distribution even after other provisional priorities such as sewage management and flood control were initiated. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency

Climate change legislation and carbon capture technology solutions,"Governments of developed countries are considering ways to work together to allow their countries to continue to grow while maintaining or capping CO2 emissions. In April of 2009, the EPA ruled that methane and CO2 are dangerous to public health and this ruling allows the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. California passed Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which requires California to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. The EU passed a Climate Change and Renewable Energy Package that proposes to cut emissions by 20%, increase energy efficiency by 20%, and generate 20% of the EU's power from renewable sources by the year 2020. World leaders met in Copenhagen in December 2009 to continue discussions towards regulating greenhouse gas emissions so that as each country continues to grow, their greenhouse gas emissions will not. Laws in Europe are forcing industry to act now. The Cap and Trade bill under consideration in the US, if passed, will force industry to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions now so that future growth will not continue to increase emissions. Setting aside the important question of economic impact, demonstrated technology currently exists to capture these CO2 emissions from the flue gases of boilers fired with natural gas, coal, and coke. Technology solutions are available now that will allow greenhouse gas emitters to capture their emissions and meet or exceed the new regulations. Companies need to develop short and long term plans now for the possibility of future regulations that will restrict their greenhouse gas emissions. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 89th Annual Convention of the Gas Processors Association (Austin, TX 3/21-24/2010).",Not About Sufficiency
Globally Gridded Satellite observations for climate studies,"Geostationary satellites have now been providing weather data for 50 years. Much of these data have been neglected by climate observation studies due to difficulties with calibration and data processing over such a long period. Collection and data ownership rights were spread out across several international agencies. The ISCCP project is overcoming these barriers and this paper has presented details on the most up-to-date and easily accessible global satellite record: GridSat. This new record provides equal-angle gridded uniform observations of brightness temperatures every 3 h from 1980 to the present for most of the globe. We have demonstrated the multiple and diverse uses of the data for climate analysis made possible by GridSat data-from predicting drought and food security in Africa to the detailed and historical tracking of hurricanes. This only touches on some of the potential uses of GridSat. Accurate records of global atmospheric fields are essential for future research on climate change as well as the understanding of the planet's meteorology. By reconstructing past satellite data and combining them with current satellite observations, a seamless data record has been obtained for the study of Earth's atmospheric state. In addition, GridSat has given a wide range of users very easy access to this new data record. Development of GridSat will continue, focusing on improving the current data files and supporting more applications. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.",Not About Sufficiency
The challenges fraught opportunity of agriculture expansion into boreal and Arctic regions,"Accelerated global warming in the cold-climate boreal and Arctic regions facilitates intensification and expansion of agriculture. However, current boreal and Arctic governmental policies targeting agricultural development differ among regions creating the risk for serious consequences for provision of goods and ecosystem services. On June 29th, 2021 we organized a United Nations Summit dialogue on “Local and global food security shaped by northern agriculture” to complement a 2019 survey of the scientific community on boreal and Arctic agriculture. The 33 attendees concluded that while climate change might offer significant agricultural opportunities in boreal and Arctic communities such as increased food security, sovereignty, and economic development, this should not be considered lightly and without strong support for environmental sustainability as carbon and biodiversity losses are main risks. Attendees expressed that using existing agricultural lands more efficiently is likely a better option than converting forest to new agricultural lands. It was also confirmed by the attendees that consistent policies are needed across northern jurisdictions that, above all else, consider environmental consequences followed by local food needs and interests. We and the attendees propose that this can only be ensured through further research and effective dialogues which reflect the needs and concerns of all members of the northern communities, including farmers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Five Lessons from COVID-19 for Advancing Climate Change Mitigation,"The nexus of COVID-19 and climate change has so far brought attention to short-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, public health responses, and clean recovery stimulus packages. We take a more holistic approach, making five broad comparisons between the crises with five associated lessons for climate change mitigation policy. First, delay is costly. Second, policy design must overcome biases to human judgment. Third, inequality can be exacerbated without timely action. Fourth, global problems require multiple forms of international cooperation. Fifth, transparency of normative positions is needed to navigate value judgments at the science-policy interface. Learning from policy challenges during the COVID-19 crisis could enhance efforts to reduce GHG emissions and prepare humanity for future crises. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

The transformation of sustainable lifestyle practices in ecoclubs,"The lifestyle and consumption habits of individuals are crucial in the question of ecological sustainability. Current consumption patterns need to be changed, requiring societies to shift cultural norms and create new consumer habits which are within planetary boundaries. In the practices of teaching sustainable consumption in higher education participatory and action-oriented research and teaching methods can facilitate the transition towards a more sustainable lifestyle for students. In this paper, we present a method operating at the boundary of education and research, the so-called ecoclubs, based on the characteristics of cooperative inquiry and transformative learning. Ecoclubs enable systematic and democratic knowledge creation to achieve concrete social change. In this paper, we explore how the method can promote transformation in the knowledge, attitude and everyday practices of the participating students regarding a sustainable lifestyle. To analyse the transformative potential of ecoclubs we used qualitative content analysis on 38 semi-structured interviews and reflection diaries of co-researchers of ecoclubs. The results show that according to the members of the ecoclubs, the most important characteristics of this non-formal education are the community, autonomy of decision-making, knowledge sharing and experience-based format. From the students' point of view, these characteristics can contribute to their higher level of engagement with sustainability and additional changes in their lifestyle. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
UN sustainable development goals: a rubric to evaluate sincerity for implementing long-term sustainability pledges,"This paper proposes a simple rubric for evaluating the sincerity of long-term or multigenerational sustainability pledges. Corporate executives and heads of state are increasingly making ambitious pledges towards sustainable development goals. These are generally in response to pressure from civil society or a more socially-conscious generation of consumers. However, there is also growing concern that these pledges will be stalled or withdrawn once pressure has abated or the year’s financial targets have been met. The sincerity for sustainability is critical in addressing global issues such as climate change, multi-national crime, immigration, hunger, and peace, which need global collaboration. Without a mechanism to forecast the likely outcome of a multilateral agreement, these pledges may eventually be found to be empty promises, without consequence for those that made them. Accordingly, this paper propounds a rubric to help evaluate the sincerity of pledges to advance the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs) and which may be applied to many other situations upon refinement.

Problems of rapid growth.,"South Korea's export-oriented development strategy has achieved a remarkable growth record, but it has also brought 2 different problems: 1) since the country's exports accounted for about 1% of total world export volume, the 1st world has become fearful about Korea's aggressive export drive; and 2) the fact that exports account for over 30% of its total gross national product (GNP) exposes the vulnerability of South Korea's economy itself. South Korea continues to be a poor nation, although it is rated as 1 of the most rapidly growing middle income economies. A World Bank 1978 report shows Korea to be 28th of 58 middle income countries in terms of per capita GNP in 1976. Of 11 newly industrializing countries (NIC), 5 in the European continent are more advanced than the others. A recent emphasis on the basic human needs approach has tended to downgrade the concept of GNP. Korea has only an abundant labor force and is without any natural resources. Consequently, Korea utilized an export-oriented development strategy. Oil requirements are met with imports, and almost all raw materials to be processed into exportable products must be imported. To pay import bills Korea must export and earn foreign exchange. It must be emphasized that foreign trade must always be 2-way traffic. In order to export more to middle income countries like Korea, the countries of the 1st world need to ease their protectionist measures against imports from developing countries.",Not About Sufficiency
A sustainable approach to traditional medicine for a future beyond the conflict with nature conservation,"About 80% of the developing world's rural population depends on traditional medicines for its primary healthcare needs; moreover, since application of medicines has been scaled up from a regional to a global level, concerns over the quality and standardization of traditional medicines have also been on the rise; however, international standardization of production methods and applications of such medicines has yet to catch up. Case studies show the severe conflict between traditional medicine and nature conservation: (i) in a survey area of South Africa, the forest biome is the vegetation type found to be most threatened by over-harvesting and 97% of the species are harvested unsustainably; (ii) the tiger is currently classified as endangered in the Red List, but many different parts of the tiger have been used to produce remedies for a wide range of complaints in traditional medicine - its population has decreased by about 95 percent since 1900; and (iii) among several threats facing Asiatic black bears, the major threat is the commercial trade in bear parts such as bile and gall bladders. Up to 13,000 adult bears are kept in cages little bigger than their own bodies and captive bears are suffering extreme pain due to daily bile extractions in such confinement. Therefore, the current mode of traditional medicine is not ecologically sustainable. As traditional medicine relies on the benefits of nature, it is fundamental to preserve the health of Earth's ecosystem and harmonize with nature. It is considered that current traditional medicine may need to be fused with the concept of ecological medicine. This is a new field of inquiry and action to reconcile the care and health of ecosystems, populations, communities, and individuals. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Liberia in the twenty-first century: Issues and perspectives,"Since the founding of the Liberian state in 1847, the country has faced several frontier issues, such as ethnic pluralism and inclusion, the elusive quest for democracy, decentralization, and socio-economic development. Cumulatively, the failure by the various state managers to address these and other major challenges occasioned an enduring civil conflict that imploded into mass insurrection on April 14, 1979, a military coup d'état on April 12, 1980, and two civil wars from 1989-1997, and 1999-2003, respectively. Significantly, these major conflict events had profound ramifications, including the deaths of thousands of people, massive internal displacement, refugee crises, the destruction of the already underdeveloped physical infrastructure and the productive sectors of the economy, and the collapse of governance. Against this background, this book explores some of these frontier issues-the travails of the peripheral state, ethnic pluralism and inclusion, the quest for democracy, decentralization and governance, the monocrop economy and its resulting implications for the crises of underdevelopment, public health, security sector reform, and post-conflict reconstruction-that have and continue to face Liberia in the twenty-first century.

Self-employed and stressed out? The impact of stress and stress management on entrepreneurs’ mental health and performance,"Introduction: Entrepreneurs play a central role in economic and social stability, yet the start-up rate in Germany has declined in recent years, possibly due to the stress associated with entrepreneurial endeavors. Stressors such as financial uncertainty and time pressure are prevalent among entrepreneurs and negatively affect their psychological well-being. However, research on stress management strategies among self-employed individuals remains limited. Methods: This pilot study conducted a quantitative analysis with 117 self-employed participants in Germany. The study focused on typical entrepreneurial work demands and selected stress coping mechanisms. Results: The analysis revealed a significant correlation between quantitative demands and mental exhaustion. Furthermore, a high positive correlation between presenteeism and workload suggests that presenteeism may partially explain the variance in workload. These findings underscore how high job demands can lead to self-endangering behaviors that are detrimental to mental health. Discussion: Although no significant moderating effect of proactive coping on the relationship between job demands and mental exhaustion was observed, significant negative correlations between proactive coping and both job demands and mental exhaustion suggest a potential protective role of proactive coping against work-related stress. This study highlights the importance of understanding stress coping strategies among self-employed individuals and their impact on entrepreneurial success and mental well-being. Further research in this area is warranted to develop effective interventions to support the well-being and productivity of self-employed individuals in Germany.

Mapping Bioenergy Supply and Demand in Selected Least Developed Countries (LDCs): Exploratory Assessment of Modern Bioenergy's Contribution to SDG7,"Bioenergy can play an important role in achieving the agreed United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, thereby advancing climate goals, food security, better land use, and sustainable energy for all. In this study, we assess the surplus agricultural residues availability for bioelectricity in six least developed countries (LDCs) in Asia and Africa, namely Bangladesh, Lao-PDR, and Nepal in Asia; and Ethiopia, Malawi, and Zambia in Africa, respectively. The surplus agricultural residues have been estimated using residue-to-product ratio (RPR), agricultural residues lost in the collection, transportation and storage, and their alternative applications. We use a linear regression model to project the economic potential of bioelectricity. The contribution of bioelectricity for meeting the LDCs' electricity requirements is estimated in a time frame between 2017 and 2030. Our results reveal that the surplus biomass feedstock available from the agriculture sector could provide the total current electricity demand in Malawi alone, followed by Nepal (45%), Bangladesh (29%), Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao-PDR) (29%), Ethiopia (27%), and Zambia (13%). This study also explores the complementarity and synergies of bioelectricity, SDG7, and their interlinkages with other SDGs. Findings from the study show that providing access to sustainable energy in the LDCs to meet the SDG7 by 2030 might be a challenge due to limited access to technology, infrastructure, and finance. Site-specific investigations on how much agricultural residues could be extracted in an environmentally benign manner for bioelectricity and increased investment in the bioenergy sector are key potential solutions in a myriad of options required to harness the full energy potential in the LDCs. © 2019 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Transnational feminism and women’s activism: Building resilience to climate change impact through women’s empowerment in climate smart agriculture,"The far western part of Nepal is the most under-developed region of the country. The majority of the population here relies on subsistence agriculture. Floods, landslides, drought and extreme temperatures associated with climate change are impacting the agricultural productivity of the region. Consequently, this area faces ongoing food insecurity, particularly affecting women and children of marginalized groups. Although the aid agencies are trying to mitigate agricultural issues associated with climate change by introducing climate smart technologies, such as Multi Water Use Systems (MUS), Multi Irrigation Technologies (MIT), Conservation Agriculture (CA) etc., the local population has been reluctant to adopt these. Moreover, the low productivity of land forces males to migrate in search of better livelihood options, leaving women to bear the extra burden of domestic and agricultural activities, resulting in adverse effects on their health and nutrition. The Anukulan-Building Resilience to Climate Change and Extremes and Disasters (BRACED) project funded by UKAID aims to create agricultural practices that are resilient in the face of climate change and natural disasters.

Assessment of Community Gardens’ role in mitigating air pollution and expanding social opportunities: Lessons from a neighborhood with limited green infrastructure in Tehran city,"This study investigates the potential of community gardens as sustainable interventions to address environmental and social challenges in Tehran's District 10, a densely urbanized area with limited green spaces and acute socio-environmental disparities. Employing a mixed-method approach, this research integrates community surveys, chi-square analyses, and Envi-Met® simulations to assess the dual benefits of community gardens. Findings reveal significant environmental gains, including CO₂ reduction, urban heat island (UHI) mitigation, and enhanced humidity regulation, facilitated by strategically placed vegetation such as broadleaf trees and phytoremediation plants. Concurrently, social analyses highlight nuanced community preferences, with gendered trends influencing garden design and family dynamics shaping plot arrangements. These insights emphasize the role of culturally sensitive and inclusive green spaces in fostering social cohesion and well-being. By bridging environmental metrics with socio-cultural dimensions, the study advances theoretical frameworks like Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) and urban sustainability. It offers a replicable model for integrating ecological and social benefits in socio-economically divided cities, particularly in Middle Eastern contexts. The research underscores the transformative potential of community gardens in enhancing urban resilience, informing policymakers and urban planners on evidence-based strategies for sustainable development. © 2025 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Determinants of food security through statistical and fuzzy mathematical synergy,"Ensuring household food security and fighting hunger are global concerns. This research highlights factors affecting food security and solutions by utilizing a nexus of statistical and fuzzy mathematical models. A cross-sectional study was conducted in district Torghar, Northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, among 379 households through a structured interview schedule. Further, the data were coded into SPSS for analysis, i.e., descriptive, and inferential statistics. In a binary logistic regression model, the study explored that agricultural productivity lag, population growth, and climate change all had a negative impact on household food security (P = 0.000). In addition, these results were further cross-checked through spherical fuzzy mathematics. The fuzzy results revealed that population growth is the most powerful factor deteriorating the existing equilibrium of household food security in Torghar. The study concluded that climate change, population explosion, and agricultural production were the major factors behind the hunger in the study area. Thus, designing a synergy based on taking all these aforementioned realities into consideration is the need of the hour. If extended, a comprehensive model of addressing these anomalies with a solely objective-based approach may work as a panacea for all ills. Lastly, this study contributes to the food security literature by introducing a new approach that is more robust and flexible than existing methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
"Rural Farmers’ Perceptions for the Impacts of Climate Change and Adaptation Policies on Wheat Productivity: Insights from a Recent Study in Balochistan, Pakistan","Climate change (CC) is a worldwide environmental issue affecting all economic sectors, especially agriculture. Pakistan is one of the countries most affected by CC due to the country’s vulnerability to catastrophic events and limited ability to adapt. Assessing existing activities for adaptation to CC at the farm level is critical to understanding their success and recommending additional government measures. This study analyzes possible farming practice modifications that Pakistani farmers may adopt to reduce the loss of agricultural output due to the rising prevalence of dangerous weather events by CC. Data for the current research were gathered from 432 wheat farmers in rural Pakistan. This article investigates many factors that impact farmers’ decisions to CC adaptation in crop production utilizing binary logit (BL) and multivariate probit (MVP) models. Gender, education level, farming experience, farm size, level of damage, access to finance, and training participation are characteristics that substantially affect farmers’ likelihood of adapting to CC. Farm size and participation in CC training were the most critical factors influencing farmers’ CC adaptation decisions. Policy recommendations were presented to increase the farmers’ resilience in the study areas to CC. These comprise expanding CC training courses, developing regulations to encourage agricultural integration, and integrating CC and adaptation to CC principles into the operations of regional organizations. Finally, based on the findings, policymakers will be better equipped to address the challenges posed by CC and create a more resilient agricultural sector. This, in turn, will contribute to improving food security, ensuring sustainable agricultural growth. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

CHOICE MODELING APPROACH TO EVALUATE THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT,"Purpose. This research aims to quantify the willingness to pay (WTP) of urban residents in the Mekong Delta for the environmental and social benefits associated with renewable energy projects. By analysing their preferences and priorities regarding renewable energy implementation, this study aims to contribute to the increasing knowledge on the drivers of sustainable energy transitions in developing regions. Methodology / approach. This paper leverages a choice modeling (CM) framework to analyse the economic viability of renewable energy investments in Vietnam. The CM technique is advantageous for its ability to capture individual preferences for complex goods or services characterised by multiple attributes and trade-offs. This enables a detailed assessment of the diverse economic values associated with renewable energy sources, beyond their traditional energy generation capacity, including environmental externalities, social impacts, and potential synergies with other sectors. Results. Residents showed significant WTP for renewable energy initiatives improving landscape aesthetics, wildlife habitats, air quality, and job opportunities. Higher income, education, and knowledge level are positively associated with greater WTP. Younger respondents showed a strong position in favor of renewable energy sources. Households with more children were less likely to support the status quo, and married respondents were more pro-renewable. Perceived community involvement emerged as a significant factor in supporting renewable energy policies. Originality / scientific novelty. This study represents a novel application of CM within the Vietnamese context, providing valuable quantitative data for policymakers and stakeholders. By estimating WTP for specific renewable energy attributes, we inform cost-benefit assessments and support the development of efficient policies for managing renewable energy investments. This data facilitates resource allocation and prioritisation of projects with the highest societal value. Practical value / implications. Our findings underscore the crucial role of public awareness and education in driving renewable energy implementation. Residents with a clear understanding of the benefits demonstrate a higher WTP. Hence, we recommend a multifaceted communication strategy to educate the public about the environmental, social, and economic benefits of renewable energy. This involves utilising diverse channels like community meetings, media outreach, online platforms, and expert engagement to disseminate accurate and engaging information. By fostering knowledge and understanding, we can cultivate a strong public mandate for renewable energy investment, facilitating informed decision-making and accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy future in the Mekong Delta. © 2024, Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting.

Is Controlled Drainage of Agricultural Land a Common Used Practice?—A Bibliographic Analysis,"Controlled drainage (CD) is one of the basic techniques used to manage groundwater levels. Farmers can optimize water levels for crop growth at different stages of the growing season. Proper drainage water management can reduce the risk of soil erosion and surface water pollution. By controlling drainage, sediment and nutrient runoff can be minimized, leading to improved water quality in nearby streams and rivers. A mixed methods approach was used, which was based on the bibliometric analysis and content analysis of 462 articles using the bibliometrix R package and VOSviewer software. The article aimed to analyze the Author Keywords and KeyWords Plus to indicate the resulting clusters of complex interdependence that emerge from the main research areas. Continuous research continues to improve drainage techniques and systems to optimize agricultural water use. The results indicated the importance of researching the feasibility of CD for agriculture. The innovation of this study is that it points out the relevance of taking up the possibility of changing the use of unilateral subsurface drainage systems with another method of controlling drainage outflows as a current global challenge, contributing to filling this gap in the literature. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis of water demand in algeria: Dynamic panel approach,"An optimal allocation of water resources is one of the challenges awaiting Algeria for years to come. With a water availability of less than 500 0m3 per capita per year, Algeria is one of the countries that sufer most from the efects of water scarcity. Despite this defcit, water in Algeria is still subsidized by the state. indeed, despite a cost of production estimated at 28.45 DA•m-3, the selling price of water for the frst bracket is 6.30 DA•m-3 (equivalent to a subsidy of 77%), because section 138 of the Water Act of 2005 provides that «... the pricing of water services is based on the principles of fnancial stability, social solidarity, incentives for water saving and protection of water quality.» Terefore, these rates generate defcits for companies responsible for water management and send a false signal to consumers (who believe that it is free). in this paper we propose a contribution to improving the management of this vital service through knowledge of factors determining this function. To achieve this, we estimated a function of water demand with a sample of 172 consumers over a period of 45 quarters, using dynamic panel estimates. Tese estimates show that the consumers in the province of Bejaia are not very sensitive to price changes. Short-term price elasticity, estimated by the method, developed by NoRDiN (1976), gives a value of -0.67 (-0.72 elasticity for long-term). Te income elasticity estimated with this method gives a value of 0.39. in other words, an increase in income of 1% generates an additional demand of 0.39%.

Evaluating Cultural Ecosystem Services Through Geospatial Social Media Data: A Study of Edirne City,"Cultural ecosystem services (CES) play a crucial role in enhancing human well-being and shaping sustainable landscape management. Geotagged photos shared on social media have emerged as an innovative data source for CES research, offering temporal, spatial, and thematic information on human-nature interactions. This study focuses on assessing CES in Edirne, a significant border city in Turkey, by analyzing geotagged photos obtained from the Flickr social photo network. By analyzing geotagged photos from the Flickr social photo network, CES values were categorized and mapped within the city. The results highlight the significance of cultural heritage and identity values, relying on historical and cultural elements like architectural structures and historical sites. Visitors tend to prefer locations that encompass these elements, emphasizing the importance of preserving and managing the city’s cultural heritage in policy-making processes. The study provides valuable insights for landscape planners, cultural heritage organizations, and decision-makers, contributing to sustainable urban governance and informing physical-spatial planning. By considering CES and the contributions of cultural heritage to tourism and the local economy, conservation efforts can be harmonized with economic development. This research demonstrates the potential of social media data in evaluating CES, offering a framework for understanding human-environment interactions, and promoting sustainable practices in urban landscapes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Does the expansion of biofuels encroach on the forest?,"In this paper, we explore the role of biofuel production on deforestation in low- and middle-income countries. Since the 2000s, biofuel production has been rapidly developing to address issues of economic development, energy poverty and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the sustainability of biofuels is being challenged, particularly at the environmental level, due to their impact on deforestation and the GHG emissions they can generate as a result of land-use changes. In order to isolate the impact of bioethanol and biodiesel production among classic determinants of deforestation, we used a fixed effects panel model of 112 low- and middle-income countries between 2001 and 2012. Firstly, we found a positive relationship between bioethanol production and deforestation in these countries, among which we highlighted the specificity of Upper-Middle-Income Countries (UMICs). An acceleration of incentives for the production of biofuels from 2006 onwards enabled us to highlight higher marginal impacts for the production of bioethanol in the case of low- and middle-income countries and UMICs. Secondly, for low- and middle-income countries, these results are not significant before 2006. Thirdly, biodiesel production appears to have an impact on deforestation before 2006 on both subsamples. These last two results seem surprising and could be related to the role of biofuel production technologies and the crop yields used in their production. © 2018 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umeå",Not About Sufficiency
"Soil carbon sequestration potential bounded by population growth, land availability, food production, and climate change","Improving soil management to enhance soil carbon sequestration (SCS)—a cost-efficient carbon dioxide (CO2) removal approach—can result in co-benefits or trade-offs. Here we address this issue by setting up a modeling framework for Switzerland that combines soil carbon (C) storage, food production and agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The link to food production is crucial because crop types and livestock numbers influence soil organic C (SOC) stocks, through soil C inputs from plants and manure. We estimated SCS rates for the years 2020–2050 for three scenarios, each with two variants for biochar: cover cropping (0.30 t CO2 equivalents [CO2-eq] ha−1yr−1), biochar addition (0.36–1.8 t CO2-eq ha−1yr−1) and agroforestry-biochar addition (2.2–2.3 t CO2-eq ha−1yr−1). Different limiting factors (land and biomass availability, population growth) affected SCS rates and indicated that they cannot be sustained until 2100 under all scenarios (cover cropping: 0.10 t CO2-eq ha−1yr−1 [2051–2100]; biochar addition: 0.35–1.8 t CO2-eq ha−1yr−1; agroforestry-biochar addition: 1.0–1.7 t CO2-eq ha−1yr−1). This information together with the associated GHG emissions is critical for planning net zero strategies and highlights the importance of integrated assessments that capture links between SCS and the food system. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Aerosol particle mixing state, refractory particle number size distributions and emission factors in a polluted urban environment: Case study of Metro Manila, Philippines","Ultrafine soot particles (black carbon, BC) in urban environments are related to adverse respiratory and cardiovascular effects, increased cases of asthma and premature deaths. These problems are especially pronounced in developing megacities in South-East Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where unsustainable urbanization ant outdated environmental protection legislation resulted in severe degradation of urban air quality in terms of black carbon emission. Since ultrafine soot particles do often not lead to enhanced PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentration, the risks related to ultrafine particle pollution may therefore be significantly underestimated compared to the contribution of secondary aerosol constituents. To increase the awareness of the potential toxicological relevant problems of ultrafine black carbon particles, we conducted a case study in Metro Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Here, we present a part of the results from a detailed field campaign, called Manila Aerosol Characterization Experiment (MACE, 2015). Measurements took place from May to June 2015 with the focus on the state of mixing of aerosol particles. The results were alarming, showing the abundance of externally mixed refractory particles (soot proxy) at street site with a maximum daily number concentration of approximately 15000 #/cm3. That is up to 10 times higher than in cities of Western countries. We also found that the soot particle mass contributed from 55 to 75% of total street site PM2.5. The retrieved refractory particle number size distribution appeared to be a superposition of 2 ultrafine modes at 20 and 80 nm with a corresponding contribution to the total refractory particle number of 45 and 55%, respectively. The particles in the 20 nm mode were most likely ash from metallic additives in lubricating oil, tiny carbonaceous particles and/or nucleated and oxidized organic polymers, while bigger ones (80 nm) were soot agglomerates. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no other studies reported such high number concentration of ultrafine refractory particles under ambient conditions. Inverse modeling of emission factors of refractory particle number size distributions revealed that diesel-fed public utility Jeepneys, commonly used for public transportation, are responsible for 94% of total roadside emitted refractory particle mass. The observed results showed that the majority of urban pollution in Metro Manila is dominated by carbonaceous aerosol. This suggests that PM10 or PM2.5 metrics do not fully describe possible health related effects in this kind of urban environments. Extremely high concentrations of ultrafine particles have been and will continue to induce adverse health related effects, because of their potential toxicity. We imply that in megacities, where the major fraction of particulates originates from the transport sector, PM10 or PM2.5 mass concentration should be complemented by legislative measurements of equivalent black carbon mass concentration. © 2017 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
A social-ecological perspective on health in urban environments.,"Human health in our cities is an expression of complex social and environmental interactions not previously faced in our long evolutionary history. In this paper, we present a social-ecological perspective on the complex nature of emerging public health problems in cities and identify some of the research questions emerging from this new view of the city. We argue that an integrative urban science agenda is needed not only to inform urban policy, planning and design, but also to alert people to the consequences of and trade-offs around their choices and behaviours.",Not About Sufficiency
Sensitivity analysis and probabilistic assessment of seawater desalination costs fueled by nuclear and fossil fuel,"The reliable supply of water and energy is an important prerequisite for sustainable development. Desalination is a feasible option that can solve the problem of water scarcity in some areas, but it is a very energy intensive technology. Moreover, the rising cost of fossil fuel, its uncertain availability and associated environmental concerns have led to a need for future desalination plants to use other energy sources, such as renewables and nuclear. Nuclear desalination has thus the potential to be an important option for safe, economic and reliable supply of large amounts of fresh water to meet the ever-increasing worldwide water demand. Different approaches to use nuclear power for seawater desalination have been considered including utilisation of the waste heat from nuclear reactors to further reduce the cost of nuclear desalination. Various options to implement nuclear desalination relay mainly on policy making based on socio-economic and environmental impacts of available technologies. This paper examines nuclear desalination costs and proposes a methodology for exploring interactions between critical parameters. © 2014 International Atomic Energy Agency.",Not About Sufficiency
Intersecting realities: Exploring the nexus between armed conflicts in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Global Health,"The eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) grapples with entrenched armed conflicts, creating a complex humanitarian crisis with far-reaching implications for global health. This paper explores the intersection between armed conflict in the region and the risks of zoonotic disease transmission, shedding light on interconnected challenges and proposing integrated strategies for mitigation. Armed conflict disrupts healthcare systems, affecting healthcare facilities (HCF) and healthcare workers (HCW), destroying millions of lives, impoverishing communities, and weakening surveillance systems. This deleterious situation is a bottleneck to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially Universal Health Coverage (UHC), as it prevents millions of Congolese from accessing healthcare services. The direct impact of armed insecurity undermines Global Health Security (GHS) by fostering natural habitat degradation and biodiversity loss, exacerbating vulnerabilities to zoonotic disease outbreaks. Forced population displacement and encroachment on natural habitats amplify human-wildlife interaction, facilitating zoonotic disease spillover and increasing the risk of regional and global spread. Biodiversity loss and poaching further compound these challenges, underscoring the need for holistic approaches that address both conservation and public health concerns. Mitigating zoonotic disease risks requires strengthening surveillance systems, promoting community engagement, and integrating conservation efforts with conflict resolution initiatives. By adopting a comprehensive approach, including the incorporation of One Health considerations in all peace-seeking and humanitarian efforts, stakeholders can enhance Global Health Security, scale up UHC, and promote sustainable development in conflict-affected regions. Creativity and strategic foresight are essential to safeguarding the well-being of human, livestock, plant, and wildlife populations in the Eastern DRC. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Darwin: Towards the sustainability of the Larrikin of Australian capital cities,"Cities, as entities, are inevitably exposed to a range of the internal and external factors that shape their urban development and planning. As complex adaptive systems, cities possess different capabilities and opportunities for the re-configuration, transformation and learning from these disturbances. This city profile explores these processes using Darwin, the Northern Territory's capital and Australia's eighth-largest city as an example. The city profile is situated within Urban Resilience Theory. It unpacks the nuanced way geographic factors and spatial isolation; natural disasters, World War 2 bombing, border security threats, natural resource extraction, and tourism have shaped Darwin's urban development. Understanding these nuances and their spatiotemporal dynamics coalesces into the identified system susceptibilities and opportunities for an adaptive and sustainable development presented in this paper. The city's unique urban governance, successive reconstruction, socio-spatial dynamics, history, and challenges make it an excellent case study of city growth dynamics and resilience within the Asian-Pacific region. The profile highlights Darwin's regional planning and the (historic) production of urban space, along with climate change risks and adaptation, increasingly inaccessible housing and unaffordability, economic growth challenges and demographic dynamics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
ICTs and the millennium development goals: A United Nations perspective,"This book attempts to create awareness about the UN-MDGs and how various ICT can be harnessed to appeal to different demographics. Current empirical evidence suggests that MDG awareness is relatively low particularly in developed countries, and that the levels of MDG awareness vary considerable across socioeconomic variables or demographics from United Nations perspective. It also examines how ICT can be used to bring about technical and social innovations strengthen livelihoods, support economic development, water and climate resilience and improve the education and health sectors and enhance development opportunities. Several studies are highlighted that reinforce the view that government support and private sector expertise and funding are important factors in ICT-based e-government solutions in developing countries.The book also builds on the thesis that a strong connection between competencies in mathematics, science, and information communication/technology is required to build logical concepts and critical thinking skills. It also examines the opportunities and barriers of promoting students learning skills, including communication, cooperation, collaboration and connection using the Wiki tool under the blackboard platform. Finally, the book also highlights the challenges involved in application of ICT in education. This is significant for educators in order to surmount these obstacles and consequently successfully incorporate ICT into the educational system.The chapters present the relevant literature on ICTs and the perceived barriers to ICT integration in basic education. They also focus on the implications of incorporating ICT in the basic educational system.

Rethinking Food and Agriculture: New Ways Forward,"Given the central role of the food and agriculture system in driving so many of the connected ecological, social and economic threats and challenges we currently face, Rethinking Food and Agriculture reviews, reassesses and reimagines the current food and agriculture system and the narrow paradigm in which it operates. Rethinking Food and Agriculture explores and uncovers some of the key historical, ethical, economic, social, cultural, political, and structural drivers and root causes of unsustainability, degradation of the agricultural environment, destruction of nature, short-comings in science and knowledge systems, inequality, hunger and food insecurity, and disharmony. It reviews efforts towards ‘sustainable development’, and reassesses whether these efforts have been implemented with adequate responsibility, acceptable societal and environmental costs and optimal engagement to secure sustainability, equity and justice. The book highlights the many ways that farmers and their communities, civil society groups, social movements, development experts, scientists and others have been raising awareness of these issues, implementing solutions and forging ŉew ways forward’, for example towards paradigms of agriculture, natural resource management and human nutrition which are more sustainable and just. Rethinking Food and Agriculture proposes ways to move beyond the current limited view of agro-ecological sustainability towards overall sustainability of the food and agriculture system based on the principle of ‘inclusive responsibility’. Inclusive responsibility encourages ecosystem sustainability based on agro-ecological and planetary limits to sustainable resource use for production and livelihoods. Inclusive responsibility also places importance on quality of life, pluralism, equity and justice for all and emphasises the health, well-being, sovereignty, dignity and rights of producers, consumers and other stakeholders, as well as of nonhuman animals and the natural world. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
"Industrial distribution and its effect on land surface temperature (LST) in Sukoharjo Regency in 2001, 2009 and 2021","The expansion of human activities, driven by population growth and various societal needs, has led to significant land-use changes, resulting in microclimate modifications. These changes have a crucial impact on land surface temperature (LST), particularly in urban areas. Urbanization, transportation, industrialization, and urban settlements are the main factors contributing to LST variations. This study focuses on the distribution of industries and their influence on land surface temperature in Sukoharjo Regency, Central Java, during the years 2001, 2009, and 2021. The research utilizes Landsat satellite imagery to analyze the industrial distribution and LST in the study area. The images were acquired on August 27, 2001, June 14, 2009, and July 25, 2021. The methodology includes land-use classification, LST extraction, and regression analysis to assess the relationship between industrial land area and land surface temperature. The results show a significant increase in the number of industries in Sukoharjo Regency over the studied period, with a growth rate of over 100% from 2001 to 2010 and further expansion until 2021. The industrial areas exhibited a clear spatial distribution in all years, indicating the impact of industrialization on land use. The regression analysis revealed a relationship between the industrial land area and land surface temperature, suggesting that expanding industries contributes to higher land surface temperatures. These findings provide valuable insights for urban planning and environmental management in Sukoharjo Regency to mitigate the impacts of climate change and promote sustainable development. © 2024 Institute of Physics Publishing.

A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Existing Approaches for Controlling and Managing the Proliferation of Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes): Review,"The proliferation of the invasive Water hyacinth (WH) plant leads to ecological, economic, public health, and agricultural problems. Several efforts have been deployed to control its spread, but no concreate results have been obtained. Only few studies dealing with systematic approaches for the WH control have been conducted. To establish a road map for the best control methods to be adopted, this review highlights the control programs that have been tested worldwide and describes, through a deep literature analysis and comparison, the most effective and sustainable control programs for managing the proliferation of this aquatic weed. Through a critical analysis, this review evaluates the advantages and drawbacks of the main proposed control methods including biological, chemical and physical methods. The obtained results suggested that short and medium term physical control promptly manages the plant’s proliferation and thus could complement the effect of the biological control. Moreover, to be economically viable, the harvested WH through physical means must be valorized to generate high value-added products. Furthermore, run-off nutrients control could reduce the end-of-catchment loads and would help the resilience of freshwater bodies and promote plant removal. Descriptive results analysis confirmed that an integrated control approach combining “biological and physical’’ is the most sustainable and cost-effective approach. The adaptation of these methods based on the socio-economic context of each country, could promote ecosystem restoration, self-generation, and conservation for a sustainable development.

Political Ecology: Anthropological Perspectives,"Political ecology is a transdisciplinary research field addressing nature - society interrelations, often with a focus on contentions and struggles over land and natural resources. Power asymmetries and social inequalities are critical points of departure, and many scholars in the field pursue a kind of emancipatory engagement with subalterns or marginalized people whose livelihoods depend on the local resource base. Capital accumulation and political economy more generally provide the overall framework for understanding such instances of dispossession and displacement of local communities by global forces of state and market. Political ecology has from its very inception remained a rather loosely defined research field. During the last two decades, the field has expanded rapidly. From an earlier largely rural focus, recent work increasingly engages environmental politics in urban settings and addresses contemporary questions such as climate modeling, genetically modified organisms, food industries, pollution, city planning and infrastructure development. The way ahead is for political ecology is to enter into new conversations with related strands of scholarship, like, for example, with science and technology studies, with studies that concern human - animal relations, and recent work in anthropology on ontology and radical alterity.

"Occurrence, sources, human health impacts and mitigation of microplastic pollution","The presence and accumulation of plastic and microplastic (MP) debris in the natural environment is of increasing concern and has become the focus of attention for many researchers. Plastic debris is a prolific, long-lived pollutant that is highly resistant to environmental degradation, readily adheres hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants and is linked to morbidity and mortality in numerous aquatic organisms. The prevalence of MPs within the natural environment is a symptom of continuous and rapid growth in synthetic plastic production and mismanagement of plastic waste. Many terrestrial and marine-based processes, including domestic and industrial drainage, maritime activities agricultural runoff and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluent, contribute to MP pollution in aquatic environments. MPs have been identified in food consumed by human and in air samples, and exposure to MPs via ingestion or inhalation could lead to adverse human health effects. Regulations in many countries have already been established or will soon be implemented to reduce MPs in aquatic environments. This review focuses on the occurrence, sources, and transport of MPs in terrestrial and aquatic environments to highlight potential human health effects, and applicable regulations to mitigate impacts of MPs.

Agricultural extension: The question of sustainable development in iran,"The sustainability of agricultural extension efforts from a village equity perspective is an issue for future development planning. Data were collected from 48 villages in Fars Province, Iran. Informant villagers were identified and interviewed in each randomly selected village. The findings indicate that the extension organization is concentrating its efforts in villages where farms are larger, the village is more developed and which to some extent are nearer to the RSC. While the concept of sustainable development goes far enough to emphasis between-generation equity, the current state of extension efforts in Fars Province has no aim of decreasing the inequity between villages, but in reality is increasing the gap. Considering the issue of poverty and environmental degradations, it is concluded that agricultural extension efforts in Fars Province is not a sustainable development effort. If extension efforts are to have a more sustainable impact, training the agricultural extension workers about sustainable development is the first step.

Review of indicator frameworks supporting urban planning for resilience and health,"While public health in European cities has improved in recent decades, new challenges brought by demographic shifts, rapid urbanization, environmental degradation, climate change and COVID-19 pandemic are making urban systems increasingly vulnerable and threatening the health, safety and well-being of their inhabitants. There is a need for a more health-focused approach in urban policies and planning, which takes into account impacts of various risks and challenges on public health. Various existing international frameworks, agendas, and tools offer guidance to policymakers on sustainable development and resilience, and provide indicators that measure progress towards their goals and objectives to facilitate evidence-based decision-making. This study reviews six of these frameworks and their indicators to assess how they address health-related aspects and support urban planning for resilience and health. The analysis considers factors impacting human health in two dimensions: 1) current state of the urban environment and 2) risk-informed urban planning and interventions. Specifically, it focuses on urban planning-related components relevant to public health. While no single framework was found to comprehensively cover all components of both dimensions, these indicator frameworks can complement each other to effectively support urban planning for resilient, sustainable and healthy cities. © 2024 UN-Habitat.",Not About Sufficiency
Zero Food Loss and Food Waste,"The global amount of food waste and food loss produced each year forces policymakers and responsible actors to rethink food systems. Successfully reducing food loss and food waste can contribute to saving natural resources for future generations, alleviating hunger, and stabilizing food prices and will have the potential to improve food security and nutrition in line with the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with Goal 2: Zero Hunger and Goal. 12: Responsible production consumption. This problem will become an increasing challenge due to the growing and wealthier world population, limited natural resources, the negative impact of climate change on food security, and the need to ensure enough quality food for the inhabitants of our planet. Food loss and food waste is a more modern phenomenon that both developing and developed countries face. In the world, every year there is more and more talk on the one hand about the insufficient amount of food and on the other hand about food losses and food waste. This is an urgent problem because about one-third of the food intended to feed the population is lost in the form of food post-harvest losses and food waste. This chapter focuses on food loss and waste from three approaches: a systematic approach, a sustainable approach, and an approach that considers food security and nutrition. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Time matters: a survival analysis of timing to seasonal food insecurity in semi-arid Ghana,"In semi-arid Africa, food insecurity is a seasonal experience, with the gradient of severity increasing from harvest and peaking during the lean season. This seasonality makes food insecurity complex and elusive to policy. Using survival analysis techniques and drawing data from semi-arid northern Ghana (n = 1100 households), we examined timing to food insecurity after harvest and the associated determinants. Kaplan–Meier estimates show that three-quarters of households run out of food 4 months post-harvest. Multivariate survival analysis further shows that gender, wealth, livestock rearing, and post-harvest loss are significantly associated with timing to food insecurity. Households in the poorest wealth category (TR = 0.83, P < 0.01) and those that do not rear livestock (TR = 0.86, P < 0.1) had faster timing to food insecurity compared to the richest and those who rear livestock, respectively. Households with the primary farmer being female (TR = 0.85, P < 0.001) had faster timing to food insecurity after harvest compared to those with the primary farmer being male. A unit increase in post-harvest loss (TR = 0.99, P < 0.01) was also associated with faster timing to food insecurity. Food policy in semi-arid Africa must be time-sensitive and responsive to contextual socioeconomic dynamics that shape agricultural outcomes. This time-sensitive approach must feature strategies that are differentiated over time. While targeted welfare strategies such as government subsidies on agricultural inputs and produce may be necessary in the short-term to help vulnerable households cope with seasonal hunger, medium- to long-term policy solutions must prioritize the diversification of rural livelihoods and address structural issues—particularly gender inequalities —in the access and control of productive resources. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency

Potential of Biochar-Amended Soil to Enhance Crop Productivity under Deficit Irrigation,"With the world population hitting 8 billion and the global climate becoming more erratic with pronounced droughts, floods, water shortages and storage depletions, the need for optimal soil and water conditions for high crop productivity and food security has become ever more urgent. There is a growing effort towards enhancing water storage in the root-zone soil layer (as a rainwater-harvesting strategy) to increase crop productivity. This study analysed the effects of biochar and deficit irrigation on rice productivity under greenhouse conditions. Grain yield, plant height, tiller number and biomass yield under 0% biochar (B1) were respectively 13.6, 6.4, 27.4 and 3.0% higher for moderate deficit irrigation (I2) than for flood irrigation (I1). Also in terms of tiller number, I2 performed better than I1 by 45.8 and 69.2% under B2 (4% biochar) and B4 (16% biochar), respectively. While for biochar the highest crop productivity was under B2, this changed vastly under the combined effects of irrigation and biochar. This suggested that crop productivity was as much dependent on irrigation as on biochar treatment. The variations in productivity could provide farmers with the choice of treatments or treatment combinations that are best suitable for their local agro-edaphic, hydroclimatic and socio-economic conditions.

Reforming a pre-existing biodiversity conservation scheme: Promoting climate co-benefits by a carbon payment,"Protecting forests provides potential synergies for both biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. Payments for ecosystem services (PES) schemes are commonly used to promote biodiversity conservation in private forests, and including carbon as another target may be a cost-efficient way to promote both goals. We analyse a hypothetical reform on a forest biodiversity PES scheme by supplementing it with a carbon payment paid to landowners for also providing carbon benefits. With a site selection model, we examine how the proposed scheme could promote biodiversity and carbon values, and what level of the carbon payment would provide the highest synergy gains. We found that introducing the payment promotes both targets, but there is a temporal trade-off between selecting sites with high carbon storage or sites with good sequestration potential. The highest synergy gains are obtained in most cases by a second-best payment level of 10–20 € tCO2−1. © 2023, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Alley cropping - Soil productivity and nutrient recycling,"In the past few decades there has been growing concern about the exhaustibility of non-renewable soil resources in developing countries in the tropics to meet the needs of present and future generations. Land degradation is a major problem in many parts of the tropics, including subSaharan Africa, mainly owing to overexploitation of vegetation and soil resources and adoption of inappropiate farming methods. The challenge is to increase the sustainable agricultural productivity of the land with acceptable inputs to meet increasing human needs, while maintaining the soil resource base and minimising environmental degradation. One technology that can meet this need for rainfed upland farming with low external chemical inputs is the alley cropping system. This technology integrates trees and shrubs in spatial zonal arrangements with food crops in the production system. The presence of woody species in the alley cropping production system has been shown to contribute to (1) nutrient recycling, (2) reduction in soil nutrient leaching losses, (3) stimulation of higher soil faunal activities, (4) soil erosion control, (5) soil fertility improvement and (6) sustained levels of crop production. These experiences can be utilised in developing sustainable and environmentally friendly agroforestry systems. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Ambient air pollution, climate change, and population health in China","As the largest developing country, China has been changing rapidly over the last three decades and its economic expansion is largely driven by the use of fossil fuels, which leads to a dramatic increase in emissions of both ambient air pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs). China is now facing the worst air pollution problem in the world, and is also the largest emitter of carbon dioxide. A number of epidemiological studies on air pollution and population health have been conducted in China, using time-series, case-crossover, cross-sectional, cohort, panel or intervention designs. The increased health risks observed among Chinese population are somewhat lower in magnitude, per amount of pollution, than the risks found in developed countries. However, the importance of these increased health risks is greater than that in North America or Europe, because the levels of air pollution in China are very high in general and Chinese population accounts for more than one fourth of the world's totals. Meanwhile, evidence is mounting that climate change has already affected human health directly and indirectly in China, including mortality from extreme weather events; changes in air and water quality; and changes in the ecology of infectious diseases. If China acts to reduce the combustion of fossil fuels and the resultant air pollution, it will reap not only the health benefits associated with improvement of air quality but also the reduced GHG emissions. Consideration of the health impact of air pollution and climate change can help the Chinese government move forward towards sustainable development with appropriate urgency. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating planetary health into healthcare: A document analysis,"Background:Anthropogenic climate change poses a major health risk to humankind. The healthcare sector both contributes to climate change and is vulnerable to its impacts. Healthcare's greenhouse gas emissions are primarily derived from its supply chain: the production, transport, and disposal of goods. Methods:Document analysis was used to investigate the workplace policies of one large, Western Canadian healthcare organization. Policies that indicated how employees should engage with resources were reviewed through the lens of environmentally responsible practice and planetary health. Content and thematic analysis were applied. Results:Four themes were identified: procurement of resources, resource utilization, resource conservation, and waste management. Conclusion:There was little evidence of environmental or climate impact consideration within the organization's policies. Implications:Healthcare organizations could benefit from integrating a planetary health perspective into their policies to deliver healthcare that considers the health and safety of both humans and the climate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change impacts and relevance of smallholder farmers’ response in arid and semi-arid lands in Kenya,"In the recent decades, extreme weather events have increased in frequency, intensity and magnitude threatening and increasing the vulnerability of rural livelihoods particularly in the arid and semi-arid lands. This study explored climate change events, the extent of their impacts on farmers’ livelihoods, farmers’ adaptation strategies and the extent of the strategies on improving farmers' ability to manage the climate change impacts in the Yatta region, Kenya. The study adopted a multi-method approach that integrated qualitative and quantitative data sources. Quantitative data were obtained from 354 household interviews while qualitative data were obtained from 8 focus group discussions. The interview data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics while the discussion data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The most experienced climate events were drought (90.7%), crop diseases (79.1%) and floods (33.30%). Livelihoods aspects greatly impacted by the climate change events were food shortage (87.29%), increased food prices (76.27%) and decreased availability of water (72.43%). Although farmers had adopted several on-farm adaptation strategies, the adoption levels remained low. Water management strategies (water conservation and water harvesting) recorded higher adoption rates of 62.71% and 53.95% respectively. The adoption of on-farm adaptation strategies had proved some potential to improve farmers’ ability to deal with the experienced climate change impacts. The regression model showed that farmers were likely to adopt crop and water management practices which they perceived had a higher probability of improving their ability to cope with climate change impacts. The occurrence of climate change events in the study area has affected agriculture productivity, food security and socioeconomic status of the households. Effective integration of potential adaptation strategies into smallholder farming systems calls for measures to address adoption and implementation barriers while ensuring alignment of policies, programs and institutional support systems. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Introduction of alternative crops in the Mediterranean to satisfy EU Green Deal goals. A review,"Climate change affects the sustainability of farming systems by downgrading soil fertility and diminishing crop yields. Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals aims to achieve key performance indicators to convert effectually currently degraded agroecosystems into smart, climate-resilient, and profitable farming systems. The introduction of alternative crops could equilibrate the negative impact of increased temperatures and water scarcity to ensure sufficient farm profitability. Alternative crops such as quinoa, teff, tritordeum, camelina, nigella, chia, and sweet potato show a high acclimatization potential to various conditions and could be components of novel re-designed agroecosystems, satisfying the goals the EU Green Deal for reduced chemical input use by 2030. In certain occasions, they adapt even better than conventional or traditional crops and could be integrated in crop rotations, demonstrating multiple uses that would benefit farmers. This review aimed to (i) evaluate seven alternative crops based on their potential contribution to climate change mitigation, in compliance with the EU (European Union) Green Deal objectives and the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) of the UN (United Nations), and (ii) examine the factors that would determine their successful integration in the Mediterranean Basin. These limiting factors for crop establishment included (i) soil properties (soil texture, pH value, salinity, and sodicity), (ii) environmental parameters (temperature, altitude, latitude, photoperiod), and (iii) crop performance and dynamics regarding water demands, fertilization needs, light, and heat requirements. All proposed crops were found to be adaptable to the Mediterranean climate characteristics and promising for the implementation of the goals of EU and UN. © 2021, INRAE and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Designing ethical strategies for global food security,"Global food security is facing five major problems: (1) the growth of the world population which is expected to reach roughly 9-10 billion people by 2050, and the resulting food needs; (2) the impact of food production on climate change and the impact of climate change on food production; (3) the physical limits of arable land, together with the limits of natural resources, where we already today are exploiting resources near to or above the renewable limits; (4) health issues related to malnutrition (in poor countries) on the one hand, and obesity (in rich countries) on the other, together with nutritional relations to heart and coronary diseases, etc.; and (5) the imperfections of the global food markets, together with its entanglement with stock markets and global financial transactions, which (a) accounts for sudden jumps in prices for basic food products, (b) transforms traditional food production areas for other uses, and (c) stimulates non-robust and partially inconsistent consumer attitudes such as scepticism to new industrial food products coupled with demands for low food prices. We face complexity so that no optimal leverage point for global action can be identified. Firstly one needs to acknowledge differences in scope between the global, regional, national and the local. Secondly one needs to do justice to: agricultural production (crops and domesticated animals), aquatic productions (capture fisheries and aquaculture) and feed production-all of them subject to different stresses, constraints and sustainability issues. There arises also ethical complexity: there is good reason to assume that values differ among people and cultures, and all global strategies may be vulnerable to defection by some parties. But we all need also to make trade-offs for the global benefit. There might be reason to fear that the best may stand in the way of the good. I thus argue for a strategy of satisfycing rather than of optimizing. We need simple heuristics which define strategies so that various actors can act and cooperate. © Wageningen Academic Publishers, The Netherlands, 2010.",Not About Sufficiency
Social Desirability Bias and the Prevalence of Self-Reported Conservation Behaviour Among Farmers,"Agriculture is recognised globally as a major contributor to environmental degradation, habitat loss, and climate change. Having reliable data on the conservation behaviour of farmers is crucial to the evaluation of policy measures intended to reduce the harmful environmental effects of agriculture and promote sustainability. In responses to direct questions about conservation behaviours, the biasing of responses to appear more socially responsible has been found to be commonplace. From a policy perspective, the degree to which farmers might overstate the frequency with which they engage in behaviours that are desirable from a conservation perspective and understate the frequency with which they engage in behaviours that are undesirable because of social desirability bias is a matter of practical importance. In this paper we use, for the first time, crosswise questioning to investigate the influence of social desirability bias on self-reporting of conservation behaviour by farmers in New Zealand. We found that the effect of social desirability bias on self-reports of conservation behaviour by farmers in New Zealand is small. Consequently, self-reporting of conservation behaviour by farmers may be relied on when evaluating policies intended to promote sustainable development. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Air pollution lowers high skill public sector worker productivity in China,"China's urbanites continue to be exposed to high levels of air pollution. Such pollution exposure raises mortality risk, lowers the day-to-day sentiment of the population and lowers outdoor worker productivity. Using a unique set of data for Chinese judges, we document that local air pollution also lowers the productivity of high skilled government officials who work indoors. Our new evidence on the effects of air pollution highlights both the challenge that pollution poses for quality of life and workforce productivity and indicates that the Chinese urban elites gain co-benefits when their cities burn less fossil fuel. © 2020 The Author(s).

"Agrobiodiversity for food security, health and income","By the year 2050, agriculture will have to provide the food and nutrition requirements of some 9 billion people. Moreover, to maintain that level of productivity indefinitely it must do so using environmentally sustainable production systems. This task will be profoundly complicated by the effects of climate change, increasing competition for water resources and loss of productive lands. Agricultural production methods will also need to recognize and accommodate ongoing rural to urban migration and address a host of economic, ecological and social concerns about the 'high inputs/high outputs' model of present-day industrial agriculture. At the same time, there is a need to confront the unacceptable levels of continuing food and nutrition insecurity, greatest in the emerging economy countries of Africa and Asia where poverty, rapid population growth and climate change present additional challenges and where agriculture is practiced primarily by small-scale farmers. Within this context, we here review science-based evidence arguing that diversification with greater use of highly valuable but presently under-valorised crops and species should be an essential element of any model for sustainable smallholder agriculture. The major points of these development opportunity crops are presented in four sections: agricultural farming systems, health and nutrition, environmental sustainability and prosperity of the populations. For each section, these crops and their associated indigenous knowledge are reported to bring benefits and services when integrated with food systems. In this paper, we conclude that not only a change in policy is needed to influence behaviours and practices but also strong leadership able to synergize the various initiatives and implement an action plan. © 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.",Not About Sufficiency
Urban sustainability and resilience building: Blue-green infrastructure for air pollution abatement and realizing multiple co-benefits,"Sustainable Development Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities) is important to be localized and achieved due to increasing urbanization across the world. Air quality management has emerged as a major urban challenge because of increasing pollution load and people getting exposed to polluted environment due to the rapid urbanization. Local climate modifications by urban landscape such as building morphology, vegetation, and water bodies define the transport of pollutants. Diminishing water bodies, dwindling green spaces, and ever-increasing built-up area have further pushed the urban centers toward the tipping point. Passive air pollution abatement and microclimate modification by mainstreaming integrating nature-based solutions (NbS) (especially nature-based infrastructure (NbI) and green infrastructure (GI)) in urban planning can help. Mainstreaming NbS in urban planning has found its relevance in the developed countries and needs recognition in urban plans of developing and underdeveloped countries. In the present chapter, we provide evidence to support mainstreaming of NbS in urban air quality management and heat mitigation in the urban canopy layer that has the potential to bring multiple co-benefits with it. Urban resilience and sustainability in the Anthropocene will equip future cities for improving air quality and also cushion the harmful effects from extreme weather events (urban heat island effect, heatwaves, flash floods, groundwater depletion, etc.) which are accelerated due to climate variability. This chapter explores opportunities and challenges of integrating blue-green infrastructure in improving urban resilience and sustainability and especially to localize SDG 11 and other interlinked SDGs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
A longitudinal study on organic food continuance behavior of Generation Y and Generation Z: can health consciousness moderate the decision?,"Purpose: This study examines the organic food continuance behavior (OFCB) of young (Generations Y and Z) Bangladeshi consumers as a part of green consumption for sustainable development. Based on the extended “Theory of Planned Behavior” (TPB), this study investigates the reasons for continuing organic food (OF) consumption. This research aims to create a model highlighting the characteristics influencing Bangladeshi consumers to continue eating OFs while considering the moderating role of health consciousness during the COVID-19 health crisis (CHC). Design/methodology/approach: This is a longitudinal study, the first phase of which was conducted in 2020, whereas the second phase of data collection is completed on December 31, 2021. Thus, a longitudinal research design (N = 196) was used to investigate whether TPB element have the same impact over the period of time in two data collection phases. It also attempted to reveal if there is any change in the level of influences of Knowledge of organic food health benefit (HAK), and health consciousness on OFCB. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants of Generations Y and Z. Partial least square structural equation modeling validates the proposed research model. Findings: Research results of phase two ensure that out of the five direct hypotheses related to social norm (SNRM), attitude (ATD), perceived behavioral control (PBRC), HAK and CHC, four (ATD, PBRC, HAK and CHC) significantly influence OFCB of Bangladeshi consumers. SNRM has no significant statistical influence on OFCB. On the other hand, all the direct hypotheses, including SNRM, were accepted during the first phase of the study. Hence, when people begin eating OF and recognize the health benefits, their firm behavioral control ensures that what others think has no significant influence on OFCB. Research limitations/implications: Most of the data for this study came from those born after 1980, commonly known as Generations Y and Z. Thus, including more data from different age groups may result in different research conclusions. The survey contains a large proportion (62%) of respondents with an income of less than BDT 40,000 per month, a price-sensitive demographic in Bangladesh. The price of OF was not included in this study though price sensitivity may have impacted the study’s findings. Practical implications: This research used one moderating and four exogenous variables to determine Bangladeshi consumers’ OFCB. HAK and PBRC are proven to be the strongest determinants. Though health consciousness, Knowledge and self-control are essential, Bangladeshi citizens’ awareness of OF and sustainable consumption is still far below compared to other countries. Consequently, this study urges policymakers to raise health awareness through various social efforts. Social implications: The Bangladesh government has various initiatives to encourage sustainable development, including promoting OF consumption. Increased OF consumption will increase demand, resulting in an enormous need for organic production. This phenomenon will benefit society as bio-fertilizers are ecologically benign, resolving soil fertility issues and reducing disease risks while enhancing nutritional content. This study can serve as the foundation for developing a plan to boost the consumption of OFs, which can have a beneficial social impact. Originality/value: Since no longitudinal study to explain the continuance of OFs has been observed in Bangladesh, this research uniquely contributes to predicting sustainable consumption behavior. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
The current health and wellbeing of the survivors of the rana plaza building collapse in Bangladesh: A qualitative study,"This study aims to identify the ongoing physical and psychological health vulnerabilities of the readymade garment (RMG) factory workers involved in the Rana Plaza building collapse in 2013, along with their experiences within the current socioeconomic and political contexts of Bangladesh. Seventeen Rana Plaza survivors participated in unstructured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews. Interviews were thematically analyzed using Haddon’s matrix to examine pre-event, event, and post-event injury experiences. The collapse of the Rana Plaza building resulted in significant physical and emotional trauma for those who survived the event. The majority of the participants were forced to attendwork on the day of the collapse. Participants reported physical health complaints related to bone injuries/fractures and amputation, severe headache, kidney problems, and functional difficulties. In addition to the reported physical health issues, the participants revealed psychological health issues including trauma, depression and suicidal ideation, sleep disorders, anxiety, and sudden anger. Participants described barriers to their potential for re-employment in the RMG sector and outlined their limited access to free healthcare for follow-up treatment. Those who survived the collapse of the Rana Plaza building continue to experience significant adverse physical and emotional outcomes related to the disaster. Yet, they have little recourse to ensure the availability of adequate health care and rehabilitation. Given the international reliance on the Bangladeshi RMG industry, continued pressure to ensure care is provided for these survivors, and to reduce the risk of future disasters, is necessary. © 2019 by the authors.

Experimental validation of dust impact on-grid connected PV system performance in Palestine: An energy nexus perspective,"Alternative energy sources -such as solar energy- is potentially needed, as the energy sector in Palestine is completely controlled by Israeli authorities. Solar energy has the potential to be a useful alternative in Palestine because it has almost 228 sunny days each year. Among the several solar energy techniques, the photovoltaic system has the potential to make a significant contribution to the development of a more sustainable energy system. The amount of irradiance that enters the solar cells has a significant impact on the photovoltaic panel's output. As a result, dust and dirt on the panel will reduce the system's effectiveness by reducing incoming solar radiation and raising the panel's temperature. So, cleaning the Photovoltaic module on a regular basis will result in decreased energy loss and more economic benefits. The primary goal of this study is to detect the impact of dust on Photovoltaic efficiency. A 170.28 kW solar system in Nablus city, Palestine that is connected to an automated cleaning system was tested between January and July of 2021. The panels in the system were left un-cleaned for different time spans (ex. Weekly, Monthly, 2 Months, And 7 Months). The impact of dust accumulation on Photovoltaic performance was then investigated by comparing the power production between the un-cleaned panels to the automated cleaned panels. However, the cleaning method employed in this study was an automated cleaning system that is programmed to clean the plant every two days. Moreover, all the Photovoltaic panels employed in this study were of the Trina solar 330 types, which had similar attributes and performance. According to the study, the worst-case scenario was leaving the Photovoltaic panels un-cleaned for seven months in a row, which resulted in a power drop of 9.99 % and an average power reduction of 2.93 % per month. As a result of climate change, energy, water, and food security are major concerns in Palestine. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Characterizing the association between child malnutrition and protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa using unsupervised clustering,"Food security, a crucial concern, intersects with land conservation, particularly in the context of growing global populations. On the one hand, ensuring food security necessitates maximizing agricultural productivity and land use, often resulting in deforestation and habitat loss. On the other hand, conservation efforts require preserving habitats and ecosystems, directly impacting land available for agricultural production. Balancing these opposing needs is intricate, presenting a complex and antagonistic relationship that necessitates innovative strategies for sustainable coexistence. Cluster analysis helps in gaining further insights on this relationship by identifying distinct groups empirically in support of the formulation and implementation of group-level policy responses. This study applied an unsupervised clustering machine learning algorithm to 399 ZDHS clusters across Zimbabwe to identify the groups of Height for Age in children under 5, their proximity to protected areas, and a bundle of socioeconomic and environmental variables obtained from the Demographic and Health Survey. The results of the cluster analysis identified four distinct groups across the country. All identified groups were explained, and their geographic positions were shown on the map. The findings revealed that households in the capital city of Harare had better nutritional status. Moreover, we identified two groups of households, both close to the protected areas, with opposite socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. Identifying these groups with distinguished characteristics has policy and managerial implications and has demonstrated the importance of considering a holistic approach in conservation and child nutrition intervention policies and programs. © AESS 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Conservation agriculture for food security and climate resilience in Nepal,"Achieving the sustainable development goals of the United Nations requires innovations in agriculture and development of climate-smart and economically feasible approaches for smallholder farmers in developing countries. Historical climate data of Nepal, which include 116 yr since 1901, has shown an increasing trend for average temperature by 0.016 °C yr–1 whereas precipitation has shown a decreasing trend by 0.137 mm yr–1. Such weather trends could enhance glacier melt associated flooding, and delayed monsoon rainfalls negatively impacting the agricultural production. The Nepalese government is promoting conservation agriculture (CA) through development of low-cost technologies that can be used effectively in difficult terrains. Such techniques include crop diversification, crop rotation, cover crops, and minimum tillage; all of which can reduce soil degradation. In addition, increasing crop residue retention can result in greater C sequestration and crop yield and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is still lack of consensus on the merits of CA in the context of smallholder farming systems in Nepal. This paper reviews existing literature and provides an overview of farming practices in Nepal, highlights near-term challenges associated with climate change and food security, and discusses the role of CA as a climate-smart strategy to minimize soil degradation and improve food security. © 2021 The Authors.

Can rewilding with giant tortoises increase woody habitat and limit fire across Madagascar's grasslands?,"Societal Impact Statement: To better understand the impact of human settlement on vegetation distribution and disturbance regimes in Madagascar, the 2021 Malagasy Grassy Biomes Workshop called for an examination of the role of extinct megafauna in determining the historic distribution of habitat mosaics across regions that are today dominated by vast treeless grasslands. A systematic literature review facilitated the reconstruction and evaluation of giant tortoise habitat, feeding habitats, diets and Aldabrachelys tortoise impacts on disturbance regimes. In conclusion, reintroduction of mixed-feeding Aldabrachelys (the diets of which were often dominated by C3 woody material, but never by C4 grasses, across its range), will likely impact plant species composition, select a tree-rich habitat mosaic, reduce fire frequency, re-establish lost ecological functions and improve landscape productivity at a range of scales, including rangeland palatability, benefitting both biodiversity and human wellbeing. Summary: Grasslands with little tree cover today comprise 80% of Madagascar's habitat. Determining their extent at human settlement can guide ecological restoration and enhance human well-being, so the 2021 Malagasy Grassy Biomes Workshop identified the role of extinct megafauna in determining habitat as a critical knowledge gap. Using a systematic literature review, combined with extracted datasets, we address this, examining anticipated habitat selection by giant tortoises following reintroduction to Madagascar (where the Aldabran giant tortoise, Aldabrachelys gigantea, provides ecological functions lost when A. abrupta and A. grandidieri went extinct). When comparing current and historical tortoise selection of habitat across the Mascarenes and Aldabra with contemporary Malagasy habitat, areas in Madagascar where giant tortoises historically ranged, today have a significantly different habitat composition to the forested habitat that supported giant tortoises on other islands. Dietary 13C isotope ratios show that Malagasy Aldabrachelys and Mascarene tortoises were mixed feeders, with diets often dominated by C3 woody intake, but never by C4 grasses. Across systems, giant tortoises required and selected, tree-rich habitat mosaics, different to current pastoralist fire-selected Malagasy grasslands characterized by sparse tree cover. Furthermore, Aldabran Aldabrachelys tortoise turf, restricted to small areas (large tracts of unshaded vegetation present physiological challenges to Aldabrachelys' survival), is compositionally different to Malagasy and African obligate C4 grazing lawns. Ecological, palaeoecological, geomorphological and molecular evidence support a lost Malagasy habitat mosaic where hippo and tortoise diets were C3-dominated, because they inhabited closed-canopy systems, with abutting open-canopy areas harbouring endemic-rich, C4 grassy understories and limited grasslands. The review suggests that rewilding with A. gigantea will help restore ecological functions, productivity and landscape-scale degradation lost through cattle-based pastoralism, re-establish tree-rich habitat mosaics, and mitigate against frequent bushfires, benefiting biodiversity and humans at multiple scales. © 2024 The Authors.

Investigation into sustainable water use in India using combined large-scale earth system-based modelling and census-based statistical data,"Sustainable water use and water scarcity are major concerns in developing countries such as India. Rapidly growing population along with increasing economic and technological development in India have resulted in increased water use leading to severe water scarcity. The present study aims to quantify and assess sustainable water use and water scarcity in India. A data-intensive approach is employed at a State spatial resolution and monthly temporal scales during the period 1991–1999. The Water Stress Index (WSI), which is defined as the ratio of total water use to available water, is used as a measure of blue water scarcity. The total available water includes surface water and groundwater while the total water uses include irrigation, industrial, domestic and environmental uses. A Community Land Model (CLM 4.0) developed by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is used to quantify the total available water in India. Water uses in India are reconstructed using a census-based statistical database while the environmental water demand is modelled following the hydrology-based approach, which allocates environmental flows as a proportion of the available water, with seasonally defined environmental flow thresholds. Further, the excess water component, defined as the amount of water remaining after meeting the demands at each time step, is incorporated into the modelling framework by adding it to the available water pool. The study estimates that 60% of the population in India faces severe water stress during the analysis period, and is more predominant in the States of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Moreover, non-renewable groundwater abstraction, which is defined as the amount of groundwater abstraction more than the groundwater recharge, is also quantified. This study identifies severe groundwater depletion in the north-western parts of India, consistent with the current estimates from GRACE satellite observations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Enjoying the outdoor pool in a cold climate: Appropriate technology, utilisation of geothermal resources and the socialisation of everyday practices in Iceland","Background: The article explores the significance of abundant geothermal resources Icelanders enjoy, the comfort of inexpensively heated homes and easily accessible year-round public spaces where young and old can gather irrespective of social standing, age and bodily condition. Result: In recent decades, the outdoor public swimming pool has become the most frequented gathering place nationwide. In the harsh climate of the North Atlantic, the harnessing of geothermal resources has transformed everyday practices in terms of heat and cold. But the transformation did not occur through adoption of readymade generic technological solutions but through an interplay of social, political and technological factors. Thus, the article shows how the adoption of appropriate technology, case-specific technological advancements designed in the context of utilisation, in the use of geothermal resources played central role in instigating social change. Indeed, the successful introduction of appropriate technology has had pervading social and cultural consequences, normalizing its generous use and yet in a way that is responsible in quest for the ecologically sustainable. Conclusion: The utilisation of geothermal water has come from being a response to a dire social, climatic and economic situation to contributing to issues of social welfare and overall wellness. © 2017, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Learning contexts and visions for STEM in schools,"STEM education is viewed as being vital for economic prosperity and productivity; and can contribute productively to changing technological, economic, and social demands of the twenty-first Century. However, there is limited consensus on how STEM education is understood and taught, and inadequate discussion around its role in addressing global issues such as climate change, health, poverty, food security, and other STEM-related social concerns. In this paper, we identify the contexts adopted for STEM teaching and learning in 47 Australian schools, drawing data from semi-structured interviews with principals and teachers who participated in the Principals as STEM Leaders (PASL) project. These data were categorised according to four visions for STEM education that align with different levels of social justice and activist approaches to STEM teaching and learning. Findings indicate that STEM education in Australia is predominantly enacted through instrumental ‘products and processes’ approaches dominated by robotics and coding. Learning contexts had minimal ‘real-life’ applications and were devoid of social and ethical dimensions of STEM applications that would better equip students with the knowledge, skills, and agency to make informed, socially just decisions about their own and others’ futures, and that of our shared environment. © 2024 The Author(s).

Is Positive Youth Development a Pathway for Sustaining Peace in Tanzania? Predicting Peace Attitudes Among Adolescents,"This study examines attitudes about peace, social justice, and community participation among Tanzanian adolescents and explores how positive youth development (PYD) contributes to these attitudes. Despite an absence of major wars and civil conflicts, Tanzania is not insulated from threats to its stability including unemployment, resource inequities, environmental degradation, ethnoreligious tensions, and increased government restrictions on the media and society. The large population of adolescents in Tanzania places additional strain on society. Promoting PYD among adolescents has been identified as a key strategy for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and promoting a peaceful society. In this study, we explore how PYD factors, such as purpose in life, ethnic identity, efficacy, and sense of community are related to attitudes about peace and social justice among Tanzanian adolescents (aged 14–17; N = 1,195). Participants from diverse regions and contexts completed Swahili versions of standardized PYD measures. Results indicated positive attitudes about peace, which were predicted by a combination of sociodemographics, internal assets, and external assets. Results confirm that youth need positive conditions, supports, and actions across multiple contexts to cultivate resilience and peace. PYD programs may apply lessons from this study by focusing on peace education, broader social identities, and positive engaging roles in the community. © 2023 American Psychological Association",Not About Sufficiency
Earthworms offset straw-induced increase of greenhouse gas emission in upland rice production,"Increasing water scarcity and rapid socio-economic development are driving farmers in Asia to transform traditionally flooded rice cropping systems into non-flooded crop production.

We conducted a field experiment on non-flooded rainfed rice fields, with and without residue amendment. In-situ mesocosms were inoculated with endogeic earthworms (Metaphire sp.), with either low (ET1: 150 individuals m− 2), or high density (ET2: 450 individuals m− 2), and a control (ET0: no earthworms). We measured GHG emissions (methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); carbon dioxide (CO2)) twice a week during the cropping season with static chambers. Effects of earthworms on yield and root growth were additionally assessed. Earthworms offset the enormous increase of CH4 emissions induced by straw amendment (from 4.6 ± 5 to 75.3 ± 46 kg CH4-C ha− 1 in ET0). Earthworm activity significantly reduced CH4 release, particularly at ET2, by more than one-third (to 22 ± 15 kg CH4-C ha− 1). In contrast, earthworm inoculation did not affect N2O emission. Straw amendment more than doubled the global warming potential (GWP). Earthworms reduced GWP by 39% at low (ET1) and 55% at high densities (ET2). Earthworm activity reduced root mass density under conditions of straw amendment but did not affect yield. Earthworms can significantly reduce detrimental effects of rice crop residue amendment on GHG release under upland rice production. Organic carbon (C) might be preserved in earthworm casts and thereby limit C availability for CH4 production. At the same time, earthworm activity might increase methanotrophic CH4 consumption, due to improved soil aeration or less root exudates. Consequently, earthworms have a strong potential for regulating ecosystem functions related to rice straw decomposition, nutrient allocation and thus GHG reduction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Urban waterlogging vulnerability assess using SAR imagery and integrated terrain analysis,"Waterlogging is a significant concern in urban areas and can result in severe disruptions and damage and it’s an urban problem. This study is conducted in Thoothukudi and Tamil Nadu, which are particularly sensitive to waterlogging because of their geographical and meteorological circumstances. Using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from 2015 to 2022, topographical analysis, land use/land cover (LULC) data, and geological insights, this research intends to identify and assess areas prone to water logging. The data source for this study comprises rainfall records from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, Sentinel-2 multispectral images from the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM).Terrain analysis was undertaken using DEM to generate elevation, slope, and aspect maps, while SAR data were processed to extract water pixels, which included the extraction of water pixels from SAR data for each year and overlaying them. The overlaid image was correlated with topographic maps to identify the high-risk regions. Key places such as Muthayapuram, Milavittan, Bryant Nagar, and Thalamuthunagar were constantly highlighted as prone to floods. Additionally, the saltpan regions, defined by low-lying water table levels, endure continuous flooding, demonstrating the usefulness of combining SAR imaging with topographic analysis for urban water management. These findings provide useful insights for urban planners and policymakers, underlining the need for deliberate steps to reduce waterlogging, maintain public health, and minimize infrastructure damage, thus enabling sustainable development in Thoothukudi. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Using Photo-Fenton and Floatation Techniques for the Sustainable Management of Flow-Back Produced Water Reuse in Shale Reservoirs Exploration,"Shale reservoirs are one of the unconventional reservoirs that a large volume of hydrocarbon reserves have remained in these reservoirs. Thereby, proper measurement of reservoir characteristics will help to provide an economical and efficient required water as water scarcity has always been a significant challenge throughout recent decades. In this study, eight different production wells in the same formation were selected to consider the required freshwater and reused water for each well as a comparative analysis. According to the results of this study, the percentage of saved water from hydraulic fracturing flow-back water is approximately 85%. Therefore, it only needs 15% of freshwater to continue fracturing process each day, and photo-Fenton and floatation would be an excellent method to remove solids and chemicals from flow-back water. Furthermore, the percentage of saved water from water flooding processes and chemical enhanced oil recovery methods is approximately 70% and 75%, respectively. Therefore, it only needs 30% and 25% of freshwater to continue water flooding processes and chemical enhanced oil recovery methods each day. The approximate total volume of annual saved water is 104 MM m3 in which 1000 inhabitants could be still alive, and it will not be necessary to use the extreme volume of sweet water for hydrocarbon production. © 2020, Crown.",Not About Sufficiency
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in dust in typical indoor public places in Hangzhou: Levels and an assessment of human exposure,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are organic pollutants (POPs) with the characteristics of environmental persistence, long-distance transmission in nature, biological accumulation and toxic effects on human health. To investigate the level of contamination due to PBDEs in typical indoor public places in Hangzhou, dust samples were collected from ten supermarkets, three electronic markets and five different areas throughout one commodity market. Based on sample pretreatment and GC-ECD instrumental analysis, the contamination characteristics, sources and the influencing factors of 14 PBDE congeners were analyzed. The results revealed that the mean of ∑14PBDEs in dust in the supermarkets and electronic markets was 546.13 ng/g and 1140.05 ng/g, respectively, while in the commodity market the mean was 1005.42 ng/g and varied in the five different areas as follows: shoe areas (1367.22 ng/g) > parking lot (1001.05 ng/g) > waiting halls (970.31 ng/g) > packet areas (933.23 ng/g) > curtain areas (755.28 ng/g). The high levels of PBDE were attributed to the quantity of electrical appliances in the supermarkets (r = 0.708*, p < 0.05) and the electronic markets (r = 0.799**, p < 0.05) through Spearman correlation coefficient analysis. BDE-209 was the dominant congener, accounting for 53.72% in supermarkets and 64.25% in electronic markets. The calculated inhalation exposure revealed that the exposure level of PBDEs varied in supermarkets, electronic markets and commodity markets, with values of 0.476 ng/day/kg, 0.993 ng/day/kg and 0.876 ng/day/kg, respectively. Moreover, BDE-209's contribution to the total intake of PBDEs was the highest, with a value of 0.072–0.970 ng/day/kg, while the value of BDE-183 was the lowest, with a value of 0–0.020 ng/day/kg. The exposure level of PBDEs in the studied indoor public places was lower than the reference dose of EPA. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
"A Comprehensive Evaluation of Water-Saving Society Construction in Xinxiang, Henan Province, China","Water is a crucial and fundamental resource. It is well known that agricultural cultivation, industrial production, and human daily life are not possible without water. Efficiently utilizing water resources is of great significance for achieving global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In order to improve water use efficiency in various industries and promote water-saving development, China has been implementing water-saving society construction since 2002. Henan Province is the main grain-producing area in China, with wheat production accounting for a quarter of the country’s total. As the core area of “Central Plains Agricultural Valley” in Henan Province, Xinxiang City plays an important role in agricultural technology innovation and agricultural production. However, Xinxiang City is facing problems of water scarcity and pollution, which constrain the sustainability of agricultural production. Therefore, building a water-saving society can solve the current water problems faced by Xinxiang City and ensure the sustainable development of the economy and society. This study built an evaluation index system for water-saving society construction in Xinxiang, Henan Province, China. The proposed evaluation index system includes 20 evaluation indices from six aspects—integrated, agricultural water, industrial water, domestic water, water ecology and environment, and water-saving management—and then divides its development level into several stages. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was adopted to calculate the index weight. Then, a comprehensive evaluation model for water-saving society construction in Xinxiang City was established by combining it with grey relative analysis (GRA). The results showed that the overall level of water-saving society construction in Xinxiang City is in the excellent stage, whereas water consumption per CNY 10,000 of GDP, the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water, the reuse rate of industrial water, and the leakage rate of urban water supply network are all in the good stage. However, the urban recycled water utilization rate is still in the poor stage. These research results can effectively and reasonably reflect the development level of water-saving society construction in Xinxiang City and guide the continued implementation of water-saving society construction. At the same time, the comprehensive evaluation of water-saving society construction helps to formulate and adjust water resource management policies and measures; it also holds significant value for sustainable water management and combating water scarcity. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The Contributions of Blue-Green Infrastructure to Building Urban Climatic Resilience —Bibliometric Analysis Based on Co-citation Networks,"Against the backdrop of global climate change and in regards of urban sustainable development, enhancing climate resilience has become a critical strategy in adapting climate change for urban areas, where blue-green infrastructure is considered an important means. Although existing studies mention that blue-green infrastructure (BGI) can promote urban resilience by increasing its own diversity, flexibility, redundancy, modularization, and decentralization, questions like where to promote, by what specific means to promote and to what extent it could promote to are still lack of scientific exploration, leading insufficient support for applying resilience theory into planning and design practice. This research recognizes the role of BGI in building climate resilience in the key fields of functioning—urban floods, sea level rise, and high temperature and heat waves—and summarizes that the common functioning mechanisms include the biophysical properties of BGI, forming modular units with other infrastructures of similar functions, and the reliance on networked structures to help the system restore its physical functions and social connections as quickly as possible after disturbances and attacks. This paper also analyzes possible obstacles that hinder the promotion of BGI solutions—the lack of data support to BGI functioning mechanism, the lack of comprehensive assessment on ecological-social-economic benefits, and the difficulty in gaining confidence from decision-makers and the public. Finally, this paper proposes countermeasures from aspects of theoretical development, planning practice, and implementation and management, in order to offer insights for building urban climate resilience. © 2021 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

"Environmental change in the agro-pastoral transitional zone, Northern China: Patterns, drivers, and implications","Chengde city is located in the agro–pastoral transitional zone in northern China near the capital city of Beijing, which has experienced large-scale ecological construction in the past three decades. This study quantitatively assessed the environmental changes in Chengde through observation records of water resources, water environment, atmospheric environment, and vegetation activity and investigated the possible causes. From the late 1950s to 2002, the streamflow presented a downward trend induced by climate variability and human activities, with contribution ratios of 33.2% and 66.8%, respectively. During 2001–2012, the days of levels I and II air quality presented clear upward trends. Moreover, the air pollutant concentration was relatively low compared with that in the adjacent areas, which means the air quality has improved more than that in the neighboring areas. The water quality, which deteriorated during 1993–2000, began to improve in 2002. The air and water quality changes were closely related to pollutant emissions induced by anthropogenic activities. During 1982–2012, the vegetation in the southeastern and central regions presented restoration trends, whereas that in the northwestern area showed degradation trends. The pixels with obvious degradation trends correlated significantly with annual mean temperature and annual precipitation. Ecological engineering also played a positive role in vegetation restoration. This analysis can be beneficial to environment managers in the active response and adaptation to the possible effects of future climate change, population growth, and industrial development and can be used to ensure sustainable development and environmental safety. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
Maize drought disaster risk assessment of China based on EPIC model,"Digital Agriculture is one of the important applications of Digital Earth. As the global climate changes and food security becomes an increasingly important issue, agriculture drought comes to the focus of attention. China is a typical monsoon climate country as well as an agricultural country with the world's largest population. The East Asian monsoon has had a tremendous impact upon agricultural production. Therefore, a maize drought disaster risk assessment, in line with the requirements of sustainable development of agriculture, is important for ensuring drought disaster reduction and food security. Meteorology, soil, land use, and agro-meteorological observation information of the research area were collected, and based on the concept framework of 'hazard-inducing factors assessment (hazard)-vulnerability assessment of hazard-affected body (vulnerability curve)-risk assessment (risk),' importing crop model EPIC (Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator), using crop model simulation and digital mapping techniques, quantitative assessment of spatio-temporal distribution of maize drought in China was done. The results showed that: in terms of 2, 5, 10, and 20 year return periods, the overall maize drought risk decreased gradually from northwest to southeast in the maize planting areas. With the 20 year return period, high risk value regions (drought loss rate ≥0.5) concentrate in the irrigated maize region of Northwest china, ecotone between agriculture and animal husbandry in Northern China, Hetao Irrigation Area, and north-central area of North China Plain, accounting for 6.41% of the total maize area. These results can provide a scientific basis for the government's decision-making in risk management and drought disaster prevention in China. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying dynamic changes in ecosystem services supply and demand for urban sustainability: Insights from a rapidly urbanizing city in central China,"Identifying the balance and dynamic changes in supply and demand of ecosystem services (ES) can help maintain the sustainability of the regional ecosystem and improve human well-being. To achieve a sustainable ecological management regime in Zhengzhou City, this study presented a comprehensive framework for identifying dynamic changes of ES supply and demand and managing ES. Using land use data of Zhengzhou City in 1995, 2005, and 2015 and incorporating expert knowledge and the ES evaluation matrix, we evaluated the spatiotemporal changes in the ES supply and demand in Zhengzhou. Gradient analysis was conducted to identify urban-rural patterns in the budgets of ES supply and demand. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was employed to identify the hotspot areas of ES surpluses or deficits. The research results show the following: (1) In the past 20 years, the supply-and-demand relationship of ES in Zhengzhou has gradually evolved in a direction where supply falls short of demand. The average budget index of Zhengzhou's ES supply and demand decreased from 7.30 in 1995 to -4.89 in 2015. Changes in the supply and demand status of ES in Zhengzhou corresponded to the background of rapid urbanization. (2) Urban-rural gradient differences exist in the budgets of ES supply and demand in Zhengzhou. Core development areas, such as the Zhengzhou urban areas, are in deficit, whereas a balance or surplus can be observed in rural areas far from urban centers. (3) The surplus hotspots of ES budgets were mainly distributed in the western and southern mountainous areas of Zhengzhou, and they were scattered and the scope shrank, with a decrease of 2.73 times in 20 years, whereas the deficit hotspots expanded outward with each urban area as the center, with an increase of 5.77%. Ecological management zoning (ecological conservation area, ecological improvement area, and ecological reconstruction area) with the effective guidance of ecological and economic policies could comprehensively improve ES management and achieve urban sustainability. The framework in this study can easily and quickly assess the supply and demand status of ES and provide scientific support for the ecological management in rapidly urbanizing areas. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Trends of technical changes in rice-based farming systems in southern China: Case study of Qianjiang municipality,"This is the second of a series of four articles aimed at providing a general analysis of the dynamic of rural intensification in China in view of sustainability, with a particular focus on the area considered in our project. Data provided in this article confirms the analysis given in the previous article about global trends for agricultural changes. In the last decades, the agricultural sector of the Hubei province managed to cope with the dramatic increase in demographic pressure by increasing more than proportionally agricultural yields. This was paid for in terms of higher environmental stress and higher reliance on external inputs. The challenge for future decades will refer to the need of matching an increasing socioeconomic pressure (=boosting the productivity of labor of farmers to get them a higher income and to make available surplus of food for the growing urban population) while limiting the environmental loading generated by agriculture. Data describing the evolution of cropping patterns, production techniques, mix and intensity of inputs used in production in the last decades seem to indicate that this would represent a formidable challenge. The nature of this challenge implies that the entire Chinese society must be involved in order to negotiate viable compromises between the need of: guaranteeing food security for China; raising the standard of living for rural populations; preserving natural resources and ecological systems for future generations.",Not About Sufficiency

Networked Public Interest Litigation: A Novel Framework for Climate Claims?,"The globalisation of public interest litigation has caused new forms of democratic lawmaking to emerge. These recent legal actions have altered the manner in which the courts, citizens and advocacy groups interact. Ordinary citizens, despite their nominal remoteness from international decision-making processes, now undertake a significant role in climate governance in and outside of courts. Coupled with the rise of advocacy networks, which bring together state actors and civil society to provide information, personnel and other resources to domestic actors, the emergent properties of recent legal actions warrant a reappraisal of how climate activism and legal activism interact.Using Guinier and Torres’s conception of demosprudence, this chapter inquires whether citizens mobilised towards climate justice are engaged in new forms of democratic lawmaking. In this regard, the international spread of public interest litigation offers a brief example of how demosprudence reconfigures this process and proceeds to frame contemporary climate change activism in the context of social science scholarship on transnational networks. Finally, transnational law and climate change is analysed for insights, utilising crowdfunding and crowdsourcing as case studies. © Cambridge University Press 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
"Palm oil and dietary change: Application of an integrated macroeconomic, environmental, demographic, and health modelling framework for Thailand","Palm oil is a cooking oil and food ingredient in widespread use in the global food system. However, as a highly saturated fat, palm oil consumption has been associated with negative effects on cardiovascular health, while large scale oil palm production has been linked to deforestation. We construct an innovative fully integrated Macroeconomic-Environmental-Demographic-health (MED-health) model to undertake integrated health, environmental, and economic analyses of palm oil consumption and oil palm production in Thailand over the coming 20 years (2016–2035). In order to put a health and fiscal food policy perspective on policy priorities of future palm oil consumption growth, we model the implications of a 54% product-specific sales tax to achieve a halving of future energy intakes from palm cooking oil consumption. Total patient incidence and premature mortality from myocardial infarction and stroke decline by 0.03–0.16% and rural-urban equity in health and welfare improves in most regions. However, contrary to accepted wisdom, reduced oil palm production would not be environmentally beneficial in the Thailand case, since, once established, oil palms have favourable carbon sequestration characteristics compared to alternative uses of Thai cropland. The increased sales tax also provokes mixed economic impacts: While real GDP increases in a second-best Thai tax policy environment, relative consumption-to-investment price changes may reduce household welfare over extended periods unless accompanied by non-distortionary government compensation payments. Overall, our holistic approach demonstrates that product-specific fiscal food policy taxes may involve important trade-offs between nutrition, health, the economy, and the environment. © 2018",Not About Sufficiency
"Does income imply food security in coffee growing communities? A case study in Yayu, Southwestern Ethiopia","The impacts on food security of a transition from agriculture focused on local consumption to the participation in global markets are uncertain, with both positive and negative effects reported in the literature. In Ethiopia, coffee production for global markets has attracted growers from across the country to the coffee-forest zones. From a national perspective, the area is not a priority for food security enhancement, as financial indicators suggest food sufficiency. In this setting, we collected food security and dietary intake data from a total of 420 (3X140) units of households, non-breast-feeding children under 5 years, and women of reproductive age. Sampling was done in two-stages, a random selection of 300 households (out of a total of 4,300) Yayu, followed by sub-sampling of households with a child and woman meeting the above-mentioned criteria. Samples were used to determine a number of food and nutrition security indicators. More than 83% of the households were found to be hunger-free in the shortage season, but dietary diversity was suboptimal. More than 50% of children under 5 years of age and women lacked foods containing heme iron in the surplus season and 88% in the shortage season. Household food security during the surplus season did not depend on income, but wealth was significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with all of the food insecurity indicators except the “Body Mass Index” of target women in the shortage season. The strongest and weakest correlation was with the “House Food Insecurity Access Scale” (−0.85), and “Weight-to-Age Z-Score” (0.25), respectively. Overall, Yayu is not fully food secure, though the situation is better than average for the country. While household income helps in achieving calorific sufficiency, greater awareness of the relevance of dietary diversity and the local means to achieve it is needed to further improve nutritional status, regardless of the participation in global markets.

Climate change mitigation through dietary change: A systematic review of empirical and modelling studies on the environmental footprints and health effects of 'sustainable diets',"The adoption of healthy diets with low environmental impact has been widely promoted as an important climate change mitigation strategy. Typically, these diets are high in plant-sourced and low in animal-sourced and processed foods. Despite the fact that their environmental impacts vary, they are often referred to as 'sustainable diets'. Here we systematically review the available published evidence on the effect of 'sustainable diets' on environmental footprints and human health. Eight databases (OvidSP-Medline, OvidSP-Embase, EBSCO-GreenFILE, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, OvidSP-CAB-Abstracts, OvidSP-AGRIS, and OvidSP-Global Health) were searched to identify literature (published 1999-2019) reporting health effects and environmental footprints of 'sustainable diets'. Available evidence was mapped and pooled analysis was conducted by unique combinations of diet pattern, health and environmental outcome. Eighteen studies (412 measurements) met our inclusion criteria, distinguishing twelve non-mutually exclusive sustainable diet patterns, six environmental outcomes, and seven health outcomes. In 87% of measurements (n = 151) positive health outcomes were reported from 'sustainable diets' (average relative health improvement: 4.09% [95% CI -0.10-8.29]) when comparing 'sustainable diets' to current/baseline consumption patterns. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with 'sustainable diets' were on average 25.8%[95%CI -27.0 to -14.6] lower than current/baseline consumption patterns, with vegan diets reporting the largest reduction in GHG-emissions (-70.3% [95% CI: -90.2 to -50.4]), however, water use was frequently reported to be higher than current/baseline diets. Multiple benefits for both health and the environment were reported in the majority (n = 315[76%]) of measurements. We identified consistent evidence of both positive health effects and reduced environmental footprints accruing from 'sustainable diets'. The notable exception of increased water use associated with 'sustainable diets' identifies that co-benefits are not universal and some trade-offs are likely. When carefully designed, evidence-based, and adapted to contextual factors, dietary change could play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation, sustainable food systems, and future population health. © 2020 The Author(s).

Examining the impact of ecological deficit on life expectancy in GCC countries: a nonlinear panel data investigation,"The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have witnessed remarkable economic growth over recent decades. Arguably, this progress of these major oil and natural gas producers has come to the detriment of the environment in terms of increased CO2 emissions and associated ecological degradation. The effects of these high emissions and environmental challenges on human health, specifically life expectancy (LE), have not been thoroughly explored in the literature. We aim to fill this research gap by assessing the relationship between Ecological footprint deficiency and the diverse and context-specific factors affecting LE in the GCC, highlighting the critical roles of urbanization, economic indicators, and digitization in shaping health outcomes. The study employs panel data for the 2000–2020 period. It utilizes linear and non-linear panel estimation methods to analyze these variables’ long-term and short-term effects. Specifically, we run unit root tests, cointegration analysis to validate our datasets, and OLS, ARDL, and panel threshold regressions to examine said relationships. Our findings reveal a significant relationship between ecological footprint and LE across the GCC countries. The results indicate that a higher ecological deficit is associated with lower LE in our sampled nations. Meanwhile, our panel threshold results highlight more nuanced impacts of our variables of interest, revealing significant threshold effects and intricate dynamics influencing LE. Our results are robust when substituting CO2 emissions for the ecological footprint suggesting and supporting our evidence for a more complex, potentially nonlinear relationship. Our study emphasizes the urgent need for sustainable environmental policies to mitigate health risks and promote long-term well-being in the GCC region. Nuanced approaches are needed to address each GCC country's health and environmental challenges. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Sustainable development, environment and poverty nexus","This paper discusses three major development problems the Asian-Pacific region currently is experiencing. First, the region's natural resources are being depleted and degraded at an alarming rate. Second, the poverty situation is even more alarming and if left unattended will exert greater stress on existing natural resources, aggravating the already precarious condition of the region's environment. Third, the development process has not helped much in curbing environmental degradation and alleviating poverty as it has failed to meet the basic needs of people or to integrate environmental considerations into growth-oriented projects, which in turn failed to reach the intended beneficiaries. The above problems make it imperative that countries in the region seriously consider the concept of sustainable development. Two measures have been identified as essential to promoting sustainable development: alleviating poverty to resolve environmental problems associated with lack of development, and integrating environmental considerations into development programs and projects to resolve environmental problems associated with development. -from Author",Not About Sufficiency

Are the Sustainable Development Goals really sustainable? A policy perspective,"Sustainable development seeks human well-being without stretching the ecological limits. It is assumed that if sustainable development is aspired at global level, the goals prescribed should be within the planetary limits. A comparison of the scores of countries with respect to Sustainable Development Goal Index (SDGI) and scores on Ecological Footprints (EF) portrays quite a grim picture where countries with high EF have attained high scores on SDGI. A further investigation into the causal relationship between SDGI, Human Development Index (HDI) and EF reveals that SDGs are being achieved in an unsustainable manner. The environmental policy perspective of the total, direct and indirect effects of EF on SDGs estimated through path analysis unveils that the existing mode of achieving SDGs is at the cost of environmental degradation. SDGs have shown improvement through the improvement in the level of HDI, where human development is being attained in an environmentally unsustainable manner. The paper establishes that SDGs achieved are ecologically unjustifiable, and a reorientation of the existing patterns of human development well within the limits of ecological capacity of the earth is to be targeted. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The concept of bio-drainage in flood prevention and the avoidance of water scarcity,"Recent torrential rains and floods in Mumbai have raised numerous questions. The Government of Maharashtra and the Mumbai Municipal Corporation have taken up certain public works to address flood control and drainage. There is, however, an urgent need to protect the mangroves, creeks and green areas, and restore the original drainage basins, water channels and culverts in the reclaimed areas. This paper proposes the adoption of the concept of bio-drainage. This is based on the twin principles of segregation of rainwater from urban waste water disposal and the principle of zero run-off drainage by creating retention ponds, lakes and storage. A network of canals can act as drainage system and also can retain rainwater for recycling during lean days. This system should incorporate regular oxidation and root-zone cleaning and filtration of storm water. Together with restoration of mangrove plantations, a network of high-tech holding tanks should be built. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
"Agronomic and Physiological Responses to High Temperature, Drought, and Elevated CO2 Interactions in Cereals","Cereals such as rice, wheat, maize, and barley account for major proportion of global food grain production. High temperature, drought, and other climate change drivers are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude, posing serious challenges to sustain global food production under changing climate. These climate change drivers often interact with each other under realistic field conditions resulting in impacts that are notably different compared to individual stress exposure. Till date, there has been no systematic synthesis comparing the impacts of different combinations of high temperature, drought, and elevated CO2 [eCO2], across cereals. Hence, the major objective of this chapter is to capture the overall agronomic and physiological impact of different combinations of these three factors compared with their independent exposure. High temperature or drought affects almost all growth and developmental phases during crop cycle leading to significant decline in photosynthesis, floral abnormalities, spikelet/kernel sterility, grain yield, and quality losses. Combined high temperature and drought stress can result in additive detrimental effect on growth physiology and productivity. On the other hand, interactive effect of [eCO2] with either high temperature or drought varies with species (C3 and C4), and also depends on other factors such as phenological stage, intensity and duration of stress, etc. Constraints and available avenues for breeding multiple abiotic stress tolerant cereals, role of modern genomic tools, precision phenotyping, and trait-based breeding program are highlighted. Finally, the chapter summarizes future research direction, in addressing combined stress resilience to ensure sustained global food security under warmer and drier climate. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable development compromise[d] in the planning of metro Vancouver's agricultural lands-the Jackson farm case,"This research provides analysis of the case of the Jackson Farm development application, embedded within the particular dynamics of the municipal, regional, and provincial sustainability land use policy culture of the Metro Vancouver region, in Canada. Within a culture of appreciation of the increasing need for sustainability in land use policy, including the protection of agricultural lands at the provincial level through the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), to urban intensification and protection of the green zone at the regional scale, lies a political conflict that comes into focus in individual land use decisions, within municipalities struggling for autonomy. This case is neither driven strictly by ""the politics of the highest bidder"" nor by policy failure; the case of the Jackson Farm is instead a case of the challenges of implementing inter-governmental coordination and collaborative governance in a context of both significant sustainability policy and urban growth. The process can be seen to follow an ecological modernization agenda, seeking ""win-win"" alternatives rather than recognizing that typical compromises, over time, may tip the direction of development away from sustainability policy goals. Understanding the twists, turns, and eventual compromise reached in the case of the Jackson Farm brings to light the implications of the shift in the regional planning culture which may necessitate a less flexible, more structured prioritization of competing goals within plans and policies in order to meet sustainability goals. We highlight this, and present an alternative implementation process within the existing policy regime with potential to aid the specific goal of agricultural land protection. © 2013 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Agriculture and trade solutions for rural poverty,"Introduction Nearly 70% of the world's poor live in rural areas, and most depend on agriculture for their livelihoods (World Bank 2007b). In many poor countries, agriculture accounts for at least 40% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 80% of employment. Thus agriculture plays a potentially crucial role in poverty reduction strategies. During the Green Revolution (in the 1960s and 1970s), development and aid communities stressed the relevance of this sector as an engine of growth for countries with a high proportion of rural population. However, in the 1980s and 1990s the attention given to agricultural policies as catalysts for development and poverty reduction decreased significantly. Currently, agriculture is once again on the forefront of development debate, as recent work on the role of agriculture in development has confirmed the importance of this sector in reducing poverty (World Bank 2007b, von Braun 2007, Food and Agriculture Organisation 2005). The set of opportunities and challenges affecting agriculture's contribution to poverty reduction have changed dramatically over the past few decades. Developing-country food demand is expected to increase over the next few decades, driven by moderate economic growth, although these increases are expected to differ across products. For example, some studies have shown that economic growth in South Asia will lead to increases of nearly 100% for meat, eggs and fish, and of 70% for milk and vegetable products (Kumar and Birthal 2007). At the same time, the resource base upon which agriculture is built will shrink due to resource degradation, climate change and competition from urban expansion. Investments in the agricultural economies of developing countries are required, but the impact of policy interventions in terms of poverty reduction will vary depending upon country-specific characteristics. One policy approach will definitely not fit all countries. © World Trade Organization 2009.",Not About Sufficiency
"Biochar and AMF Improve Growth, Physiological Traits, Nutrients of Turmeric and Soil Biochemical Properties in Drought Stress","Drought is one of the main problems in the world affecting the yields of plants. Climate change has led to increased droughts affecting food security and sustainable development goals (SDGs) targets. Applying biochar and Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can effectively increase soil fertility and crop yields under drought conditions. This study highlighted the impact of biochar and AMF on the growth of turmeric, nutrients and physiological properties under drought stress. Turmeric plants were grown under water stress in a net house. Four treatments used for the experiments included control (only soil), biochar, AMF, and combined treatment with biochar and AMF. For the pot experiments, 1% biochar was mixed with soil. AMF contained 100 spores/g and 1200 IP/g. Maximum improvement in rhizome biomass, rhizome number and availability of plant nutrients was observed after the co-application of biochar and AMF. Significant improvement in microbial biomass and AMF spore numbers was also observed in the soil exposed to biochar + AMF. Applying biochar and AMF in combination under water stress significantly enhanced fluorescein diacetate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activity in the soil compared to control. Results suggested that co-supplementation of biochar and AMF can promote soil nutrients along with turmeric's growth parameters and physiological properties in water stress. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to National Academy of Agricultural Sciences 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Measuring the end of hunger: Knowledge politics in the selection of SDG food security indicators,"Ending world hunger remains one of the central global challenges, but the question of how to measure and define the problem is politically charged. This article chronicles and analyses the indicator selection process for SDG 2.1, focusing in particular on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) indicator. Despite alleged efforts to separate political and technical aspects in the indicator selection process we find that they were entangled from the start. While there was significant contestation around which indicators should be selected, the process was characterized by pathway lock-in: The complexity of food security quantification and the resource constraints in the process favored already established data infrastructures and milieus of expertise, locking in the position of FAO and its established food security indicators. The SDG 2.1 indicators frame food insecurity in terms of caloric supply and demand and individual experience, arguably excluding dimensions of democratic agency, sustainability and other dimensions and drivers of food insecurity. The lock-in has thus embedded a narrow concept of food security in the major global indicator framework for food security monitoring. This is likely to have significant effects on how food insecurity is addressed nationally and internationally. Addressing the knowledge politics of food security indicators is important to broaden and open the agenda for sustainable transformation of food systems. Statistics and indicators are important tools in this agenda, but a diversity of approaches and data infrastructures from the local to the international level are needed to understand the multiple dimensions and drivers of food insecurity. © 2023, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Historical development and the present status of Japanese dams,"Dams have contributed to population growth and technological innovation by reducing the risk of flooding and allowing humans to cultivate productive alluvial soils on river floodplains. However, in countries where many dams have already been constructed, many problems have been observed, such as river environment degradation, aging of the embankments, and inadequate dam performance. As the social and natural environment surrounding dams is becoming more complex and diverse, it is necessary to understand the current overall status of dams and the history of their construction such that we may consider how social capital and dams are related to human society and the natural environment. In this study, the relationship of basic information of dams and the social background in which the dams exist was examined for Japan, where dam construction began in earnest in the late 1800s and became a driving force for economic development. The situations surrounding dams are drastically changing, as maintenance and management costs increase due to the aging of dams and water demand varies due to changes in the industrial structure of a region. Simultaneously, there are instances where dams are expected to reduce damage, such as in the presence of more severe and frequent droughts and floods caused by climate change. It is therefore necessary to remove or restructure dams while considering numerous complex and diverse factors, such as the local social conditions, potential future changes, and environmental impact of rivers. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Incoporation of Sustainability into Engineering Curriculum,"The engineering programs at West Texas A&M University (a mid-sized regional institution in the Texas A&M University System located in the Amarillo, Texas region) are incorporating concepts of sustainability and climate change into their curriculum. This institution has four engineering programs all established in the last twenty years: mechanical (2003), civil (2010), environmental (2012), and electrical (2016). At the time of establishment, engineering societies were not heavily emphasizing the role of sustainability and climate change to the extent that societal requirements now warrant. ABET accreditation criteria and engineering society ethical guidelines now emphasize the concept of sustainability. In 2021, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) revised and updated their Policy 360 which addresses both sustainability and climate change. This paper will highlight how these concepts of climate change mitigation and adaption in engineering design are being incorporated into the curriculum across all four programs. Climate change is sometimes a polarizing topic, and its use in our region is unique because of general student apathy or resistance to its inclusion in the classroom. The lessons learned from the authors can be used to better incorporate sustainability and climate change around myriad engineering programs. These lessons concern how to include these ideas in curriculum as well as how to deal with human impacts and moral components of any discussion concerning the future of human well-being. A discussion of prior investigations of the incorporation of these topics into engineering programs is included and a proposed method of further incorporation of sustainability and climate change topics is proposed. We also consider the utilization of climate change ideas in ABET outcomes to enhance to real-world application of the outcomes for students. © 2023 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
"Techno-socio-economic analysis of fog-to-water solution for climate change hazard area: Sumba Island, Indonesia","The global demand for water has been growing rapidly in the last decade with a global population growth rate of 1.1% p.a., which is equivalent to 81 million people per year. Southeast Asian countries are facing severe water scarcity challenge due to their location in the tropics. In 2018, the Sumba Island experienced the highest temperature of 36°C and lesser rainfall of 911.1 mm3 per year and it was classified as a long dry island prone to drought due to dry winds from Australian desserts. This paper focuses on the perceived effect of water scarcity on livelihoods in the Mandahu Village, Indonesia, due to climate change. Sampling and survey covered rural households and the findings showed that the average household of 4 to 8 people consumed around 250 dm3 of water per day. The community relied on two main sources of clean water from two main springs. However, the prolonged dry season from May until December every year results in major challenges to access water and eventually affect the agricultural productivity. Hence, the feasibility of the fog collection technology has been investigated from technological, economic and social points of view as a reliable and cost-effective source of water. The outcome of this work will produce a feasibility statement for fog-to-water as an alternative solution counteracting water scarcity in the Sumba Island, a solution which can be replicated in other climate change stricken hot spots in Southeast Asia. © 2021.

Physiochemical changes of mung bean [vigna radiata (L.) r. wilczek] in responses to varying irrigation regimes,"Mungbean is one of the most powerful pulses providing substantial protein for human diets and fixing N to the soil, improving nutritional food security and agricultural sustainability. The production of summer mungbean in the tropics and subtropics is adversely affected by drought due to water scarcity caused by various factors as well as lack of rainfall. Irrigation at different growth phases is not a suitable solution. An environmentally friendly and economically viable answer is a convenient irrigation management option that will be available to farmers together with droughttolerant genotypes. The study considered to determine the effect of differences between droughttolerant and drought susceptible genotypes on water productivity response and physiological traits in mung beans. To quantify seed yield-related to irrigation at different growth stages eventually to quickly determine the most appropriate irrigation stage. One water stress tolerant mung bean genotype (BMX-08010-2) and one sensitive genotype (BARI Mung-1) were grown in the field with four different irrigation schedules along with water stress conditions (no irrigation) under rain shelter at Regional Agricultural Research Station, BARI, Ishwardi, Pabna, Bangladesh. The experiment was laid out in split plots with three replications, with irrigation schedules assigned in the main plot and mung bean genotypes assigned in the side plots. Water use efficiency ranged from 3.79 to 4.68 kg ha−1 mm−1 depending on irrigation regime, and mung bean seed yield of mung bean Water stress decreased plant water status, photosynthetic pigment and membrane stability index, and increased proline soluble sugar content. Treatments that received irrigation during two or three phases (I3 or I4 ) gave significantly higher yields than those that received irrigation during only one stage (I1 and I2 ) with the lowest yield. While the yield obtained ranged between 1145.44 kg ha−1 with seasonal irrigation of 277 mm (I4 ) and 555.14 kg ha−1 without irrigation (I0 ). The flowering stage (I3 ) was recorded as the most sensitive growth stage with an 18.15% yield reduction compared to the treatment with triple irrigation (I4 ). Also, depending on the irrigation sources, at least two irrigation phases should be provided at the triple leaf stage (I2, i.e., 20 DAS) and at the flowering stage (I3, i.e., 35 DAS) to achieve the highest yield. Genotypes that maintained the higher performance of physicochemical traits under water stress provided higher seed yield and promoted drought tolerance. Therefore, these parameters can be used as physiological and biochemical markers to identify and develop superior genotypes suitable for drought-prone environments. © 2021 by the authors.

"Climate Change Impacts and Mitigation Approach: Coastal Landscape, Transport, and Health Aspects","Planet earth is warming over time and a warmer planet favorable for its winners for sure rather than suffering countries. Bangladesh, a lesser climate change contributor, is the worst victim country of the world, facing significant natural calamities almost every year, which has consequences from the country’s coastal margin to parliament. Insights into how climate change impacts coastal areas landscape, transport network, and human health, which is crucial for sustainable development, are identified in this study. The coastal landscape’s southwestern 170 km length and 20 km width, the mid-central zone’s existing road network, and the overall impact on human health due to climate change are identified by a semi-structured questionnaire survey with professional clusters, satellite image processing, and secondary data. Study finds, islands, and exposed sub-districts such as “Patharghata’ are facing high currents, a cause of rapid erosion–accretion, road networks are severally affected by cyclones, storm surge, erratic rainfall, extreme heat, and flood where salinity and extremely hot weather have adverse consequences for human health. Additionally, not only climate change issues but also local implications are responsible for these changes. Several structural and bioengineering approaches are suitable for reducing land erosion and road network damage where awareness is building suitable for appeasing human health risks. Finally, this study focuses on real field conditions with community perceptions who are field survivors for all climate change issues, rather than computer-aided simulation models, and the outcome would be helpful for academicians, researchers, national and international stakeholders to develop climate-resilient, sustainable coastal cities in the near future. © 2021, SpringerNature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate change and economic growth: Computational experiments in adaptive economic modelling,"This paper reports experiments on the possibility of formulating operational models of adaptive/evolutionary non-convex general equilibrium systems to be adoptable as a framework for social choice to implement a socially optimal growth and climate change program. To perform this task, this paper develops and implements a growth model which includes climate change and the adaptive process of endogenous technical progress in a new growth modelling non-convex framework named ADICE-ADAPTIVE ([1-4], see [5] also) as a framework for social choice and welfare optimisation in a knowledge economy. Literature in this area is not well developed and the present study has advanced knowledge in this field. A numerical implementation of an optimisation climate change and growth model with the adaptive processes of endogenous technical progress encounters difficulties of non-existence of an optimum solution. The feasible endogenous model results show an absolute reduction in GHG emissions and only a slower rise in GDP growth implying sustainability of social welfare both in economic and environmental terms. The present experiments show the limitations of climate change policies implied by known integrated climate change and economic growth optimisation models and the problems and prospects for formulating an optimal growth program in a knowledge economy including the climate sector. The findings of the study have implications for the need for and the possibility of optimal social choice and economic equilibrium in a non-convex intertemporal knowledge economy, taking into account the climate sector. Policy implications of the result emphasise research and development to foster technical progress which can have a positive effect on sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
The Ecological Intensity of Well-Being in Developing Countries: A Panel Data Analysis,"Recent sustainability research into balancing the demands for ecosystem services and benefits in the form of human well-being has developed into a study of the ecological intensity of well-being (EIWB). Research into EIWB focuses on its reduction, as a pathway to sustainability. Here, we present a revised measure of EIWB by using a ratio of ecological footprint per capita (EF) to infant survival rate (ISR). EF per capita is included as an indicator of anthropogenic environmental stress and ISR serves as a measure of well-being, well suited to the context of developing countries. By using panel data for 81 developing countries, we mainly draw our hypothesis from a modernization perspective and check the effects of economic growth and urbanization on EIWB. The results indicate that economic growth has a positive effect on EIWB; also increasing urbanization can increase EIWB. Overall, these findings suggest that developing countries are less likely to achieve sustainability with current modernization practices. © 2021, Society for Human Ecology.

Integrating Deep Ecology into Corporate Environmental Responsibility: A Sustainable Model for the Mining Sector,"This research aims to analyze the implementation of Environmental Corporate Responsibility (ECR) through the Corporate Social Responsiveness (CSRv) Model in the mining industry by incorporating the Deep Ecology Concept to achieve justice in sustainable development. The research adopts a normative juridical method, employing legal, conceptual, comparative, and case study approaches, along with an analysis of legal issues related to applicable environmental regulations and policies. The findings indicate that the application of ECR through the CSRv Model is crucial for companies to effectively address social and environmental demands. This approach involves the use of appropriate mechanisms and the active participation of communities in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of ECR initiatives, ensuring they align with the company’s goals and strategies. The ECR model, as CSRv, illustrates the potential for companies to manage their social and environmental responsibilities sustainably. In the mining sector, CSRv provides a comprehensive solution for sustainable development by focusing on the responsible management and protection of natural resources. By incorporating Deep Ecology values into CSRv practices, mining companies can contribute to both human well-being and environmental sustainability, measured through the effectiveness, appropriateness, sustainability, empowerment, and participation rates of ECR programs. This holistic approach guarantees that mining activities are conducted responsibly and sustainably. © 2025, Fakultas Hukum Universitas 17 Agustus 1945 Surabaya.

Do off-grid solar energy based productive activities increase income of beneficiaries: An impact evaluation using PSM and DID techniques,"Renewable energy has emerged as one of the climate-friendly development alternatives to provide clean and sustainable energy access. Productive use of renewable energy for livelihood and income generation is an emerging area of development, however, it remains under-explored for its socio-economic impact on beneficiaries, although such interventions have potential to contribute towards climate change targets and sustainable development goals. In this context, this research, using control-treatment group design, estimated the economic impact of solar energy-based productive interventions (solar energy for cotton yarn production) located in Amravati district of Maharashtra (India). For improving the robustness of the impact evaluation, the study used retrospective observational study design combining the use of propensity score matching and difference-in-differences techniques. The results obtained from the field-based data of 411 respondents indicated that there was a strong demand and interest for productive activities using renewable energy among the weaker section of the society for livelihood with a need to increase awareness about associated policy frameworks and to provide concessional capital. The findings further depicted a significant change in beneficiaries' income vis-à-vis non-beneficiaries with associated multiplier effects on food access, health, education, women upliftment, and work environment. Though, the rise in the income was impressive, however, there was a need to upscale the solar charkha operations to contribute additional income to the beneficiaries' family, to complement the intervention using RE based, locally processed commodities with beneficiaries managing the supply chains, and to provide concessional capital structure. These findings are critical as India has promulgated several policy measures including productive use of renewable energy to address development issues and climate change goals. © 2024 International Energy Initiative",Not About Sufficiency
From project-based to community-based social impact assessment: New social impact assessment pathways to build community resilience and enhance disaster risk reduction and climate action,"Social impact assessment can greatly contribute to sustainable regional and urban planning. However, social impact assessment is used primarily in the context of pre-determined projects, while social impact assessment’s role in informing regional and urban plans before projects are even conceived is under-estimated. Moreover, a narrow understanding of the social impacts of projects leads social impact assessment practitioners to consider such impacts as being the outcomes only of the technical characteristics and risks of projects and their implementation, rather than also of broader social, cultural and political-institutional processes. In this article, we reflect on these gaps in social impact assessment. We expand the conceptualization of the social impacts of projects to better consider how social impacts are also influenced by the social dimensions of risk and resilience, and by the knowledge processes and governance strategies that inform and regulate projects. We conceptualize these processes and strategies and design new conceptual models to derive the social impacts of projects. Finally, we reflect on the strategic role social impact assessment can have in enabling social learning and sustainability transformation in localities (i.e. community resilience) and across multiple governance levels (i.e. social resilience). With this article, we contribute to building a key role for social impact assessment in disaster risk reduction, climate action and sustainable development. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Reflections on the New York City Health Czar Proposal of 1977 and Its Origins,"New York City’s fiscal crisis of 1975 was the result of many years of deficit spending to support a variety of expanded services and generous union contracts. These deficits were covered for years by the issuance of city short-term notes and long-term bonds. Eventually, the city’s mounting debt of $14 billion led to its inability to sell its notes and bonds. In order to deal with the possibility of the city’s financial collapse, the governor of New York State and the state legislature created the Emergency Financial Control Board (EFCB), whose purpose was to manage the city’s budget and cost reduction plans. They also created the Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) responsible for fiscal oversight and the sale of specially issued bonds. Both agencies eventually played major roles in preventing the city’s financial collapse. In an effort to address the costly 5,000 excess acute care hospital beds in the city, the governor and his advisors proposed the creation of a Health Czar (HC). The purpose of this position was to shift responsibility for hospital closures and downsizing from the state government to a para-governmental individual. While there was early support for this proposal by some print media, opposition soon arose because of the flawed structure of the proposal. Also, many initially opposed it because it included the city’s public health agency, the New York City Department of Health (NYCDOH), which did not have any responsibility for hospitals. The HC proposal eventually lost broad support because it bypassed legally established processes for the oversight of hospitals. It also almost uniquely focused on the public hospital system, and in so doing gave a pass to the voluntary hospitals and their excess bed capacities. The proposal eventually lost the support of the then mayor when the governor publicly supported a rival candidate in an upcoming election. The election success of yet a third candidate opposed to the proposal resulted in its eventual abandonment by the governor. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Japan's healthcare system to protect the public from the global financial crisis,"The global financial crisis triggered by the collapse of major American securities company ""Lehman Brothers"" in September 2008, has exerted a huge impact on the Japanese economy, so much so that our prime minister at the time called it a ""once-in-a-hundred-years financial crisis.""

Wealth heterogeneity and escape from the poverty-environment trap,"A mutual link between poverty and environmental degradation is examined in an overlapping generations model. Environmental quality affects labor productivity and wealth dynamics, whereas wealth distribution determines the degree to which agents rely on technology that has a large environmental load, and therefore the evolution of environmental quality. This interaction creates a ""poverty-environment trap,"" where a deteriorated environment lowers income, which, in turn, accelerates environmental degradation.

FUNCTIONING OF THE SOCIAL PROTECTION SYSTEM OF UKRAINE UNDER MODERN CHALLENGES,"The social protection system of Ukraine functions under the conditions of numerous challenges, namely demographic changes; the impact of globalization; changes in the labor market under the influence of digitalization; climate change; macroeconomic crisis caused by wartime. This creates pressure on the functioning of the specified system and requires a comprehensive assessment of its functioning. This paper aims to identify gaps in the functioning of the social protection system of Ukraine and to create recommendations for its further development under modern chal-lenges. It used such tool as a Social Protection System Review (SPSR), which provides instruments for the assessment of a country's social protection system within five di-mensions: needs; coverage; effectiveness; sustainability; and coherence. This assessment became a ground for creating recommendations for the development of the social protection system of Ukraine under modern challenges. The assessment of Ukraine's social protection system within five dimensions led to the finding that the level of social risks in Ukraine is rising as indicated by negative tenden-cies of economic and social indicators; many social programs exist based on the quite difficult legislative basis what decrease level of effectiveness of social protection; social expenditures exceed social receipts, and this does not support the sustainability of Ukraine's social protection system. To develop the social protection system of Ukraine under modern challenges, it is important to make social protection inclusive through the implementation micro micro-social insurance in cooperation with the private insurance sector; to visualize eligibility criteria for social benefits and other conditions for social programs what will make legislative basis of social protection clearer; to optimize number of social protection programs for increasing the level of benefits per vulnerable person; to make stronger the coherence and coordination between social institutions; to increase the social and financial literacy of population aimed at rising of their awareness of financial mechanisms of social protection. © 2023 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Growing Climate Change Impacts on Hydrological Drought and Food Security in District Peshawar, Pakistan","Hydrological drought, defined as a lack of water in the hydrological system, is a complex natural hazard that has a numerous effects on ecosystems and civilization. It decreases the soil moisture leading to decreased soil fertility ratio, crops productivity and groundwater levels, which results in increased food insecurity, physical and mental health problems, debts, while in some cases, people are forced to migrate owing to its associated problems. This study examines the impacts of hydrological droughts in one of the towns of District Peshawar, Pakistan. Three indicators were used to investigate hydrological drought in town IV district Peshawar; rainfall data, water table levels and stream flow of rivers were collected and a community survey was conducted to ascertain the hydrological drought parameters of the town. The reduction trend in water table varied from one to three feet per year in the study area, precipitation has reduced in the study area and stream flow discharges showed large differences in rivers capacity in the last two decades. Questionnaire survey from local population augmented the precipitation, water table and stream flow data. Analysis of the research results show that three main indicators for drought, which is precipitation, water table, and surface water availability have reduced in the study area. The study concludes by recommending measures in order to mitigate the impacts of the hydrological drought in town IV, district Peshawar. Government departments, NGOs, INGOs, and other stakeholders should take immediate steps in order to mitigate the hydrological drought impacts in this area, otherwise this may seriously affect the food security, social wellbeing and environment of the study area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency

Lessons for African microfinance providers and regulators in the aftermath of COVID-19,"This paper is concerned with microfinance in Africa post Covid-19, a crisis from which the continent is still recovering while new crises such as climate change challenges emerge. The resilience of the microfinance sector to crises must not only address operational weaknesses revealed by the pandemic, but also exploit the post-crisis potential to build resilience in areas such as digitalization and smallholder agriculture. New rules and regulations should target microfinance providers (MFPs) and enable them to quickly comply with new rules and those normally in force. This paper calls for the inclusion of all forms of MFPs, allowing for customized applications of policies and regulations. Moreover, measures for regulators include re-defining post-COVID-19 target groups, enhancing liquidity and MFP risk-based management, ensuring sustainability and best practices, activating prompt monitoring of the sector, and ensuring a consultative and coordinated culture. Measures for MFPs include increased micro-saving, avoiding subsidies, unlocking the full potential of smallholder farmers, a strong movement towards inclusive digital finance, product development, and partial movement towards crises-resistant, non-interest types of lending in countries with Muslim minorities. © 2022 Practical Action Publishing.

A study into psychosocial work stressors and health care productivity,"Background: World Health Organization's Healthy Workplace Framework and Model has emphasized addressing psychosocial work stressors as one of the important avenues toward creating a conducive workplace. Management and interventions of these adverse stressors have been unremarkable; impairing work productivity. Objective: To explore the effect of psychosocial work stressors on health service productivity. Methods: Using Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire II and Healthcare Productivity Survey, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 225 health and allied health professionals in the largest referral hospital in Brunei. Multiple linear regression was used to explore the relationship of each domain of work productivity to indicators of psychosocial work stressors. Results: Psychosocial work stressors explained more than 50% of the variance for health care productivity. Influence at work, role clarity, rewards and job satisfaction were among the factors with the highest contributions to this relationship. Conclusion: Crucial factors were identified and discussed, however, due to complexity of this relationship, international collaborations and efforts are required to ameliorate adverse effects of psychosocial stressors and improve health service productivity. © 2019, NIOC Health Organization.

"Working holiday makers in Australia: food security, climate change, and the backpacker tax","This commentary considers an often overlooked contribution to food security in Australia—the labour of working holiday makers. Their ability to act as a flexible and mobile temporary workforce is essential to the maintenance of the Australian agricultural industry. Previously, no tax was payable on income below $18,200, but a 2015 proposal to increase their tax rate sparked a vigorous political debate and so revealed their importance to the agricultural industry. A decline in backpacker numbers would cause agriculture to shrink to cope with smaller workforces. But the effects of climate change are expected to further shrink agricultural areas as extreme events and hotter temperatures impact crops, livestock, and the productivity of agricultural workers. Issues that appear manageable when viewed in isolation, such as increases in the tax rate on working holiday makers, become more problematic when viewed in conjunction with other impacts affecting agriculture. Thus, the ‘backpacker tax’ risks making food security harder to maintain at a time when Australia's agricultural system is already vulnerable to climate change. © 2017 Institute of Australian Geographers",Not About Sufficiency
Converting biomass waste into valuable biomaterials and bioactive compounds: an overview of antimicrobial activities in the pursuit of global sustainability and health,"The escalating global population poses formidable challenges to addressing pressing environmental concerns, hindering progress towards sustainable development goals. Unregulated human activities, particularly the excessive reliance on fossil fuels and unsustainable agricultural practices, contribute to pollution, climate change, and resource depletion. Inadequate waste management systems exacerbate environmental degradation and pose risks to public health. Leveraging biological resources and urban/industrial waste emerges as a promising solution. Various waste materials, such as food waste and agro-industrial by-products, have been efficiently repurposed into valuable bio-based products. This review explores the diverse applications of agricultural and food waste repurposing, including microbial production of biopolymers and biosurfactants, as well as the extraction of biologically active compounds for potential antimicrobial drugs. ©2024 by EDIMES - Edizioni Internazionali Srl All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Application of Irrigation Management and Water-Lifting Technologies to Enhance Fodder Productivity in Smallholder Farming Communities: A Case Study in Robit Bata, Ethiopia","Small-scale cultivation of irrigated fodder is emerging as a vital production system in mixed farming communities. Efficient water management plays a key role in enhancing forage production, especially in the face of changing climate. A field-scale experimental study was conducted in Robit Bata kebele, Ethiopia, with the following objectives: (1) to examine the effects of conventional farmers’ irrigation scheduling versus climate-based irrigation scheduling; and (2) to assess the influence of water-lifting technologies (manual pulley and solar Majipump) on dry matter yield (DMY), water productivity (WP), irrigation labor productivity (ILP), and water productivity in terms of crude protein and metabolizable energy (WP.CP and WP.ME) of Napier grass. The experiment used 10 farmers’ plots each with a size of 100 m2. Half of the plots were treated using farmers’ scheduling while the other half were treated using climate-based irrigation scheduling. Monitoring of irrigation water use and crop yield took place over two irrigation seasons from November 2020 to June 2021. Results showed there was an interaction effect of irrigation management (p = 0.019) and water-lifting technologies (p = 0.016) with season on DMY. The highest DMY occurred in the first irrigation season with climate-based scheduling and solar Majipump use. The interaction effect of irrigation management and season affected WP (p = 0.047). Climate-based scheduling had a higher WP in the first season, while farmers’ scheduling had a higher WP during the second season. On average, the solar Majipump outperformed the pulley, achieving 5 kg m−3 WP compared to the pulley’s 4 kg m−3 (p = 0.018). Emphasizing the seasonal impact, it is recommended to promote full irrigation (climate-based) in the first season for maximum yield and WP. Conversely, in the second season, advocating only deficit irrigation is advised due to water scarcity and sustainability concerns. Statistical parity in DMY and lower WP with full irrigation in the second season supports this recommendation, addressing the challenge of optimizing water use in the context of a changing climate and ensuring sustainable smallholder agriculture practices. Therefore, implementing appropriate irrigation management alongside efficient water-lifting technologies holds the potential to enhance fodder productivity and bolster smallholder farmers’ livelihoods. Future research should explore the comparative benefits of irrigated fodder versus other crops and the overall advantages of investing in irrigated fodder over vegetables. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Role of rice in food security of Bangladesh,"The rapidly growing population of Bangladesh puts tremendous pressure on its scarce natural resources. To feed the growing population, there is an urgent need to develop more efficient and sustainable agricultural production and more equitable distribution systems. Rice plays a pivotal role in all spheres of life in Bangladesh and when it comes to food security of the rural farmers it is the most important commodity in terms of livelihood and food. Contribution of the crop sub-sector to GDP is about 11.16% and 61.0% of the AGDP. The contribution of crop sub-sector to AGDP is dominated by rice. The rural work force of 47.4 million is directly or indirectly engaged in agricultural activities at farm level and different components of value/market chain. Rice is grown all year round in Bangladesh having three distinct rice growing seasons - namely Aus, Aman and Boro. It is grown in four ecosystems viz., irrigated rice (Boro), rainfed or partially irrigated (transplanted Aus and Aman), rainfed upland (direct-seeded Aus), and deepwater (broadcast Aman). More than 73% of the rice area is covered by modern varieties developed by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BBRI) and 6% by hybrid rice which are marketed by the private seed companies. The local low yielding varieties are grown in the marginal lands. Currently, the net cropped area (NCA) and the total cropped area (TCA) of Bangladesh are 7.94 Mha and 14.41 Mha respectively. More than 33.77 Mt cereals were produced from 12.62 Mha of the TCA and 31.98 Mt of rice was produced from 11.35 Mha. On average, each person in the world consumes more than 50 kg of rice a year. Asian countries consume about 86.70% of the global rice production and Bangladesh consumes 6.50% of the global rice production. In Bangladesh per capita availability of rice per year is about 160 kg which makes it the fourth highest consuming nation of the world. Rice is still the dominant source of energy and protein in an average Bangladeshi diet. The actual intake of rice is about 416 g per capita per day. Of the 2318 kcal, 69% of the total calorie and 50% of total protein come from it. Although the desirable levels of these are 46% and 36% respectively; upsetting the dietary balance with respect to protein and fat intake. The Government policies and strategies to improve food security are aligned with access, utilization and availability through Public Safety Net Programs, research and extension to increase productivity of agricultural crops, and stabilization of food prices. The average annual growth rate (2001-11) is about 1.34%, which translates into about two million additional new mouths every year need to be fed. The projected population for the 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 would be 169.54, 189.85, 205.13, and 217.54 million respectively and to feed them the estimated food requirements based on the desirable dietary pattern, especially rice and wheat, would be 23.020, 25.778, 27.853 and 29.538 Mt. On top of this climate change will complicate the food security issue further. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of Co-benefits of Climate Change Response in Vietnam,"The implementation of climate change adaptation and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) mitigation not only results in synergy and co-benefits of climate change adaptation and mitigation but also leads to socioeconomic, environmental, and institutional benefits. The main objective of the study is to develop the methodology to assess the cobenefits of climate change response actions in nationally determined contributions (NDCs) as well as Vietnam’s sustainable development goals (SDGs). During this research study, it was found that GHG mitigation can lead to an adaptation rate of 2.9 (on a scale of 5), which is higher than that of climate change adaptation to climate change mitigation (which is a rate of 1.9 on a scale of 5). Most of the overall benefits of GHGs reduction are gained in the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector. As for the climate change adaptation, the overall benefits can be received most in the agricultural and the rural development sector. Moreover, the implementation of climate change actions also facilitates the achievement of SDGs. © Common Ground Research Networks, Huynh Thi Lan Huong, Nguyen Thi Lieu, Tran Thanh Thuy, All Rights Reserved.

The relationship between oil prices and real estate loans and mortgage loans in azerbaijan,"Azerbaijan is a major exporter of natural resources (oil). Improving the welfare of the population is a priority, as the driving force of the modern economy, including future economic progress, is the human factor, human capital, its science, knowledge, ability to use technology. Thus, at the current stage of Azerbaijan’s economic development, the issue of social welfare, including housing, is one of the most important indicators of the sustainability of dynamic socio-economic development in the country in the long run. For this reason, the study of the issue of directing part of the oil capital to mortgage loans and real estate is urgent.Taking into account the dependence of oil revenues on world oil prices, the article examines the relationship between world oil prices in the Republic of Azerbaijan over the past 10 years (2010M01−2020M01) between mortgage loans and real estate loans. The ARDL model was used as a research model. In addition, stationary tests of variables (ADF, PP, KPSS) were performed and the Engle-Granger cointegration equation was evaluated using both FMOLS and DOLS, as well as CCR. The stability of the models was studied. EViews_9 econometric software was used for calculations and graphing.As a result of the analysis, it was theoretically determined that there is a certain positive correlation between world oil prices, mortgage loans and real estate loans. Our recommendation may be to accelerate the transfer of part of oil revenues to mortgage loans and real estate to improve housing. © 2021, Econjournals. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability assessment of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers,"Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) are a central instrument in international development cooperation and of key importance in guiding donors' policies towards southern recipients. However, many aspects of the PRSP have been criticised by a variety of development stakeholders. A checklist of 85 questions has been developed to analyse the inclusion of aspects of sustainable development in PRSPs and to point to sustainability challenges and opportunities. It thus facilitates targeted advice and quality improvements. The checklist was applied to a selection of 12 PRSPs of developing countries. The results reveal an insufficient integration of the ecosystem services concept, of biodiversity and of climate issues. Property rights, gender issues, water and energy are as a rule well elaborated. PRSPs show significant variation in the integration of environmental sustainability issues. Sustainability assessments can contribute to significant improvements between first and second generation PRSPs provided the assessments are supported by a strong institutional framework and a dedicated political commitment towards sustainability. © IAIA 2007.",Not About Sufficiency
"The hindu kush-himalaya (HKH) in the global and marine context: Major estuaries, coast-scapes, ocean coupling, seawalls, over 2 billion people and global (food) security","Water and nutrients have global cycles; it’s based on rivers those systems collect and involve land, oceans and the atmosphere. Most rivers end in estuaries where freshwater meets the saltwater. The Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region features major watersheds and usually those end in extensive wetlands and then estuaries. Many estuaries of world relevance are fed by the HKH watersheds affecting global biodiversity, biomass and carbon sequestration, but also human civilizations! The productivity of rivers and their estuaries can affect human well-being, entire nations, the global economy and even trigger warfare. Here an overview is shown for river outflows, the major estuaries in the HKH region such as the Yellow Sea, the Mekong, the Sea of Okhotsk, the deltas of the Ganges and the Indus. Central Asian wetlands fed by rivers but not ending in oceans are also covered in this assessment, e.g. Aral and Balkash Lakes. While mapping the HKH area has been ongoing for centuries, precise maps of the dynamic wetlands and estuaries, within a good time frame and available - are rare making impact assessment tricky. Even for tsunami forecasts (where human lives are lost and precise coastline maps are needed with a 1 m accuracy or better) such data rarely exist. Man-made climate change- namely melting glaciers, floods and brackish water inflow - are creating major changes in those millennia-old life-systems and human societies. The status and connectivity of those estuaries are discussed and how they affect global society. Arguably, we are facing a global river, estuary and ocean crisis still to be addressed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
Asthma management in British South Asian children: An application of the candidacy framework to a qualitative understanding of barriers to effective and accessible asthma care,"Background: In the UK, people of South Asian origin with asthma experience excess morbidity, with hospitalisation rates three times those of the majority White population and evidence suggests that South Asian children with asthma are more likely to suffer uncontrolled symptoms and hospital admissions with acute asthma compared to White British children. This paper draws on data from The Management and Interventions for Asthma (MIA) study to identify the operation of barriers to optimal care and good asthma control for South Asian children. Methods: The MIA study followed a multi-phase, iterative, participatory design, underpinned by the socio-ecological model. Findings presented here are from face-to face, semi-structured interviews with South Asian (Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin) parents and carers of a child with asthma (n = 49). Interviews were conducted in English or relevant South Asian languages using specially trained community facilitators. Data were transcribed verbatim and analysed according to the principles of interpretive thematic analysis, facilitated by the use of NVivo. Results: Seven dimensions of candidacy are identified: identification of candidacy; navigation; the permeability of asthma services; appearances at health services; adjudications; offers and resistance and operating conditions in the local production of candidacy. The analysis demonstrates several ways in which a potential lack of alignment between the priorities and competencies of British South Asian families and the organization of health services combine to create vulnerabilities and difficulties in effectively managing childhood asthma. Conclusions: Healthcare systems have a responsibility to develop services that are sensitive and appropriate to the needs of their communities. In South Asian communities, further efforts are required to raise awareness of symptoms and effectively communicate how, when and where to seek help for children. There is a need for improved diagnosis and consistent, effectively communicated information, especially regarding medication. Parents made several suggestions for improving services: presentations about asthma at easily accessible community venues; an advice centre or telephone helpline to answer queries; opportunities for sharing experiences with other families; having information provided in South Asian languages; longer GP appointments; extended use of asthma nurses; and better education for healthcare professionals to ensure consistency of care and advice. © 2016 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Plant biology education: A competency-based vision for the future,"Societal Impact Statement: Plant biology is an essential discipline for addressing global challenges from food security to climate change. In order to achieve this, we need to educate plant biologists who can contribute to research, enterprise, policy, public engagement and beyond. This article explores the potential of competency-based education, which emphasises what students can do rather than what we know. A flexible and adaptable model of competency based plant biology education is presented, along with practical suggestions and examples. This provides a framework through which we can educate plant biologists equipped to address major scientific and societal challenges of the future. Summary: Plant biology is an essential discipline for addressing global challenges from food security to climate change. In order to achieve this we need to educate plant biologists who can contribute to research, enterprise, policy, public engagement and beyond. In this article, I explore some of the issues and challenges facing plant biology education from authentic research driven curricula to the impact of AI. In order to effectively educate the plant biologists of the future I propose moving to a competency based approach to education. Competency based education emphasises what students can do rather than what they know. I present a three-domain competency model for plant biology, structured around (i) knowledge and information literacy (ii) disciplinary and professional experience and (iii) self-awareness and personal development as three interdependent aspects of competency. I accompany this with twelve proposed competencies for plant biologists. The model is flexible, robust and adaptable to specific local requirements and future demands of plant biology education. In reimagining plant biology education in this way we can present our discipline as exciting and relevant to students, and equip them with the capabilities required to contribute to plant biology activity from research to public policy. © 2024 The Authors.

Sustainable human resource management practices and corporate sustainable supply chain: the moderating role of firm technology orientation,"This study investigates how corporate human resource management practices contribute to sustainable supply chain practices. The two types of human resource management practices relating to corporate social responsibility, include (1) employee standardised work conditions practices and (2) employee well-being and development practices. Corporate technology orientation is investigated as a moderating factor on the empirical evidence from 15 companies in the mobile technology industry. Results show that employee well-being and development practices lead to stronger community-oriented social responsibility, thus the increasing adoption of sustainable supply chain practices. Corporate technology orientation strengthens the positive impacts of employee well-being and development practices. These results imply the importance of adopting appropriate human resource management strategies, to deploy a sustainable supply chain. © 2024 The Author(s).

Global assessment of future sectoral water scarcity under adaptive inner-basin water allocation measures,"Water scarcity has become a major threat to sustainable development under climate change. To reduce the population exposure to water scarcity and improve universal access to safe drinking water are important targets of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 in the near future. This study aims to examine the potential of applying adaptive inner-basin water allocation measures (AIWAM), which were not explicitly considered in previous studies, for mitigating water scarcity in the future period (2020–2050). By incorporating AIWAM in water scarcity assessment, nonagricultural water uses are assumed to have high priority over agricultural water use and thus would receive more water supply. Results show that global water deficit is projected to be ~3241.9 km3/yr in 2050, and severe water scarcity is mainly found in arid and semi-arid regions, e.g. Western US, Northern China, and the Middle East. Future warming climate and socioeconomic development tend to aggravate global water scarcity, particularly in Northern Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East. The application of AIWAM could significantly mitigate water scarcity for nonagricultural sectors by leading to a decrease of global population subject to water scarcity by 12% in 2050 when compared to that without AIWAM. However, this is at the cost of reducing water availability for agricultural sector in the upstream areas, resulting in an increase of global irrigated cropland exposed to water scarcity by 6%. Nevertheless, AIWAM provides a useful scenario that helps design strategies for reducing future population exposure to water scarcity, particularly in densely populated basins and regions. Our findings highlight increasing water use competition across sectors between upstream and downstream areas, and the results provide useful information to develop adaptation strategies towards sustainable water management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Setaria viridis as a model system to advance millet genetics and genomics,"Millet is a common name for a group of polyphyletic, small-seeded cereal crops that include pearl, finger and foxtail millet. Millet species are an important source of calories for many societies, often in developing countries. Compared to major cereal crops such as rice and maize, millets are generally better adapted to dry and hot environments. Despite their food security value, the genetic architecture of agronomically important traits in millets, including both morphological traits and climate resilience remains poorly studied. These complex traits have been challenging to dissect in large part because of the lack of sufficient genetic tools and resources. In this article, we review the phylogenetic relationship among various millet species and discuss the value of a genetic model system for millet research. We propose that a broader adoption of green foxtail (Setaria viridis) as a model system for millets could greatly accelerate the pace of gene discovery in the millets, and summarize available and emerging resources in S. viridis and its domesticated relative S. italica. These resources have value in forward genetics, reverse genetics and high throughput phenotyping. We describe methods and strategies to best utilize these resources to facilitate the genetic dissection of complex traits. We envision that coupling cutting-edge technologies and the use of S. viridis for gene discovery will accelerate genetic research in millets in general. This will enable strategies and provide opportunities to increase productivity, especially in the semi-arid tropics of Asia and Africa where millets are staple food crops. © 2016 Huang, Shyu, Coelho, Cao and Brutnell.",Not About Sufficiency
"Factors influencing the conversion of arable land to urban use and policy implications in Beijing, China","Rapid urban land expansion and the resulting arable land loss have put food security in China at risk. This paper investigates the characteristics and mechanism of arable land conversion in Beijing using a logistic model based on land-use data for 2001 and 2010. The results suggest that (1) arable land conversion tends to occur near built-up areas, city centers and major roads; (2) arable land that lies closer to irrigation canals and country roads is less likely to be converted to urban use; (3) arable land that is bigger in size and has a more regular shape has a lower probability of conversion to urban use; and (4) the Prime Farmland Protection policy and related land-use plan have played a positive role in preserving arable land, demonstrated by the probability for arable land conversion inside a prime farmland boundary is 63.9 percent less than for land outside the boundary. Based on these findings and on sustainable-development principles, we suggest that, rather than an exclusive focus on controlling the quantity of arable land, the location and characteristics of the arable land should be a primary consideration when designing urban policies and plans. © 2014 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Assessing grain crop water productivity of China using a hydro-model-coupled-statistics approach. Part II: Application in breadbasket basins of China,"We assessed the basin-scale crop water productivity (CWP) on staple grain crops, i.e. rice, wheat, maize, soybean, at major breadbasket basins of China over time periods of 1997-2004. The multiple-year average CWP was 1.06 kg m-3 for the selected basins (equivalents of 946 m3 water consumption in producing 1 metric ton of crop economic yield), varying from 0.97 kg m-3 to 1.18 kg m-3. Of all the water consumed in crop production, irrigation water contributes 28-41%, while soil-stored precipitation contributes 59-72%, confirming the crucial yet hitherto under-estimated role played by green water in total crop yield formation. The blue water depletion rate ranges from 0.48 to 0.87, with most of the basins exceeding 0.50, while the green water depletion rate from 0.39 to 0.85, with the majority of basins being beyond 0.60. We conclude that both blue and green water shortage will contribute to water scarcity in grain crop production. The mission of ensuring China's food security will entail multiple trade-offs among water security, ecosystem conservation, environment protection, and human development with increasing challenges in the years to come. However, increasing water productivity through research innovation and technological upgrades at river basin scale is a key to mitigating water stress that may be caused by increasing food production in the coming decades. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Sustainable development in South America: A case study of the agricultural sector of Peru,"This paper explores the scope of sustainable development practices in South America with a special focus on sustainable development practices in the agricultural sector of Peru. The agricultural sector plays a key role in the economy of Peru with a contribution of around 8.2 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. Concerns over the unsustainable nature of the agricultural sector of Peru in recent years has raised questions as to what are the underlying factors preventing the sector from producing sustainable agricultural products. Consequent to this, the agricultural sector of Peru has faced criticism over deforestation, land degradation and pesticide pollution. The four identified factors that hinder the adoption of sustainable practices in the agricultural sector of Peru have been identified: financial resource limitations, environmental degradation, hyper-urbanisation and political instability. This article concludes that with possible factors drawn together to resolve these challenges, the end result will yield economic well-being, social justice, and environmental conservation in the entire country.",Not About Sufficiency
Reconsidering gas as clean energy: Switching to electricity for household cooking to reduce NO2-attributed disease burden,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a prevalent air pollutant in urban areas, originating from outdoor sources, household gas consumption, and secondhand smoke. The limited evaluation of the disease burden attributable to NO2, encompassing different health effects and contributions from various sources, impedes our understanding from a public health perspective. Based on modeled NO2 exposure concentrations, their exposure–response relationships with lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes mellitus, and baseline disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), we estimated that 1,675 (655–2,624) thousand DALYs were attributable to NO2 in urban China in 2019 [138 (54–216) billion Chinese yuan (CNY) economic losses]. The transition from gas to electricity for household cooking was estimated to reduce the attributable economic losses by 35%. This reduction falls within the range of reductions achieved when outdoor air meets the World Health Organization interim target 3 and air quality guidelines for annual NO2, highlighting the significance of raising awareness of gas as a polluting household energy for cooking. These findings align with global sustainable development initiatives, providing a sustainable solution to promote public health while potentially mitigating climate change. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
"Examining the Barriers to Gender Integration in Agriculture, Climate Change, Food Security, and Nutrition Policies: Guatemalan and Honduran Perspectives","Gender mainstreaming is seen, at international level, as critical to achieving national development goals and addressing key global challenges such as climate change and food and nutrition insecurity in the agriculture sector. Our study examined the barriers leading to poor gender mainstreaming and potential solutions in policies applying to gender, agriculture, climate change, food security and nutrition, in both Guatemala and Honduras. We used a case study approach to analyze the barriers to gender integration in these governments' policies. Based on semi-structured interviews and policy document analysis, we conducted a methodology based on policy mix, policy integration and policy translation. Results show that, despite having made multiple international commitments on gender issues and having gender-labeled policy and governmental gender bodies, gender mainstreaming in the policy cycle is lagging. There are multiple barriers of a different nature and at different levels that explain the lack of gender integration in the policy cycle, related and linked to: (1) policy translation from the international level; (2) structural policy barriers at national level; (3) behaviors and corruption; and (4) lack of knowledge and capacity. Solutions to address these barriers have been identified. Our results confirmed the literature findings and also introduce new elements such as the importance of considering the nature of the relationship (purely technical and/or political) between governments and international cooperation actors to evaluate the level of gender integration in policy. Furthermore, we stress that for key informants, there are no (easy) solutions to redress the poor gender integration strategies implemented. Finally, we noted that no solutions were provided relating to structural racism and machismo, religious extremism, power groups, and censorship of civil society. © Copyright © 2021 Howland, Acosta, Muriel and Le Coq.",Not About Sufficiency
Synthesis of green IS frameworks for achieving strong environmental sustainability in organisations,"People are entirely dependent on the environment for existence. In spite of this crucial dependency, human activities are degrading the Earth's environment. The degradation now threatens the wellbeing of all people and possibly the long-term survival of the human race. Environmental degradation has many dire symptoms, such as anthropogenic climate change including global warming, deforestation, water and air pollution, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity, and depleted fish stocks, all of which are intensified by an increasing global human population. Environmental sustainability is the solution to environmental degradation, and emphasises maintenance of the environment in order to support human life into the far future. There are several degrees of environmental sustainability, namely very weak, weak, strong, and very strong or absurdly strong. Of these, the overwhelming scientific consensus on environmental degradation necessitates strong environmental sustainability. Organisations are prevailing and prominent social structures that drive the world's economy. Nevertheless, organisations continue to degrade the environmental during the extraction of natural resources, production and processing, and the emission of wastes. However, organisations have considerable resources for achieving environmental sustainability, in the form of technology, global reach, knowledge, power, innovative capacity, motivation, and the capacity for change. Organisational change is impacted by Information systems (IS), which have been influential in enabling and transforming the world's organisations over the past fifty years. IS include information technology (IT) hardware and software, people, processes, and have specific purposes. Green IS includes Green IT, which focuses primarily on environmental sustainability throughout the IT lifecycle, and Green IS aim to enable and transform entire organisations toward environmental sustainability. Green IS present a fundamental solution to organisational environmental degradation, and researchers have developed numerous Green IS frameworks in this regard, each with a particular and significant perspective.

Synergistic association of long-term ozone exposure and solid fuel use with biomarkers of advanced fibrosis,"This study aims to explore the association of combined exposure to cooking fuel type and ambient ozone (O3) levels with hepatic fibrosis indices among rural adults. A total of 21,010 participants were derived from the Henan Rural Cohort. Information regarding cooking fuel type was collected through a questionnaire, and the concentration of ground-level O3 for each subject was obtained from the Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP) dataset. A generalized linear model was used to examine the independent association of cooking fuel type or O3 exposure with hepatic fibrosis indices (FIB-4, APRI, and AST/ALT), and their possible interactions with advanced fibrosis were conducted. Compared to clean fuel users, solid fuel users had increased the risk of advanced fibrosis, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of its assessment by FIB-4 1.240 (1.151, 1.336), by APRI 1.298 (1.185, 1.422), and by AST/ALT 1.135 (1.049, 1.227), respectively. Compared to low O3 exposure, the adjusted ORs of advanced fibrosis assessed by FIB-4, APRI, and AST/ALT in women with high O3 exposure were correspondingly 1.219 (1.138, 1.305), 1.110 (1.017, 1.212), and 0.883 (0.822, 0.949). The adjusted ORs of advanced fibrosis assessed by FIB-4, APRI, and AST/ALT for solid fuel users with high O3 exposure relative to clean fuel users with low O3 exposure in women were 1.557 (1.381, 1.755), 1.427 (1.237, 1.644), and 0.979 (0.863, 1.108), respectively. Significant additive effect of O3 exposure and solid fuel use on FIB-4-defined advanced fibrosis was observed in women, which was quantified by RERI (0.265, 95%CI: 0.052, 0.477), AP (0.170 95%CI: 0.045, 0.295), and SI (1.906, 95%CI: 1.058, 3.432). Solid fuel users with high O3 exposure were significantly associated with elevated hepatic fibrosis indices among rural women, suggesting that poor air quality may induce hepatocellular injury, and women might be more vulnerable to air pollution. The findings indicate that using cleaner fuels in cooking is an effective measure to maintain sustainable development of the environment and gain beneficial effect on human health.

Natural resource rent's effect on Ethiopian inequality and manufacturing's moderating role: evidence from dynamic simulated ARDL model,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the impact of natural resource rents on income inequality in Ethiopia from 1981 to 2022 and investigate whether investments in manufacturing moderate this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Dynamic autoregressive distributed lag simulation and Kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS) models are used to analyses short- and long-run relationships, as well as the potential moderating role of manufacturing. Findings: The bounds test indicates natural resource rents have a long-run positive effect on inequality but a short-run negative impact. The KRLS model finds manufacturing conditions for this linkage in the short run. In the long run, economic growth decreases inequality following an inverted Kuznets pattern, while government expenditures reduce disparities when directed at priority social services. Research limitations/implications: The findings provide mixed support for theories while highlighting nuances not fully captured without local analyses. Strategic sectoral investments may help optimize outcomes from resource dependence. Practical implications: The results imply Ethiopia should prudently govern resources, productively invest revenues and prioritize social spending to equitably manage industrialization and uphold stability. Social implications: Reducing disparities through inclusive development aligned with empirical evidence could help Ethiopia sustain peace amid transformation and realize its goals of shared prosperity. Originality/value: This study applies innovative econometrics to provide novel insights into Ethiopia's experience, resolving inconsistencies in the literature on relationships between key determinants and inequality. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Response of Winter Wheat Production to Climate Change in Ziway Lake Basin,"The crop production and limited freshwater resources in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) Lake Basin of Ethiopia have been facing pressure from warmer and drier climates. Thus, irrigation with the goal of increasing water use efficiency and the productivity of rainfed agriculture is vital to address climate effects, water scarcity, and food security. This study is aimed at assessing the sustainability of winter wheat production under climate change, and irrigation as an adaptation measure to improve yield, crop water productivity (CWP), and irrigation water productivity (IWP) in the CRV of Ethiopia. AquaCrop is applied to evaluate the effects of climate change and simulate irrigation as an adaptation measure. The analysis covers the baseline (1981–2020) and future (2026–2095) periods with each period categorized into three rainfall years (wet, normal, and dry). The future period is described using two representatives’ concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and PCP8.5) scenarios. The results under rainfed and future climate conditions show that the winter wheat yield and CWP are projected to be lowered as compared to the baseline period. Most importantly, a significant reduction in wheat yield and CWP is noticed during the dry years (−60% and −80%) compared to the wet years (−30% and −51%) and normal years (−18% and −30%), respectively. As compared to rainfed agriculture, irrigation significantly reduces the risk of wheat yield decline and improves the CWP. Irrigation is also able to improve the CWP of rainfed wheat production ranging from 0.98–1.4 kg/m3 to 1.48–1.56 kg/m3. A projected CWP improvement of 1.1–1.32 kg/m3 under irrigation is possible from 0.87–1.1 kg/m3 under rainfed conditions. The study concludes that optimizing irrigation as a climate-change-adapting strategy in the CRV has a more pronounced positive impact to the rainfed production system, especially for the dry and normal years. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Resilience, political ecology, and well-being: An interdisciplinary approach to understanding social-ecological change in coastal Bangladesh","The commodification of peasant livelihoods through export-oriented aquaculture has brought about significant social-ecological changes in low-lying coastal areas in many parts of Asia. A better understanding of the underlying drivers and distributional effects of these changes requires integration of social and ecological approaches that often have different epistemological origins. Resilience thinking has gained increased traction in social-ecological systems research because it provides a dynamic analysis of the cross-scalar interactions between multiple conditions and processes. However, the system-oriented perspective inherent in resilience thinking fails to acknowledge the heterogeneous values, interests, and power of social actors and their roles in navigating social-ecological change. Incorporation of political ecology and well-being perspectives can provide an actor-oriented analysis of the trade-offs associated with change and help to determine which state is desirable for whom. However, empirical demonstrations of such interdisciplinary approaches remain scarce. Here, we explore the combined application of resilience, political ecology, and well-being in investigating the root causes of social-ecological change and identifying the winners and losers of system transformation through empirical analysis of the differential changes in farming systems in two villages in coastal Bangladesh. Using the adaptive cycle as a structuring model, we examine the evolution of the shrimp aquaculture system over the past few decades, particularly looking at the power dynamics between households of different wealth classes. We found that although asymmetric land ownership and political ties enabled the wealthier households to reach their desired farming system in one village, social resilience achieved through memory, leadership, and crisis empowered poorer households to exercise their agency in another village. Material dimensions such as improved living standards, food security, and cash incomes were evidently important; however, freedom to pursue desired livelihood activities, better environmental quality, mental peace, and cultural identities had significant implications for relational and subjective well-being. © 2017 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Corporate Purpose and Stakeholder Value: Historical, Economic, and Comparative Law Remarks on the Current Debate, Legislative Options, and Enforcement Problems","For whom is the corporation managed? The traditional idea is one of profit generation for shareholders. The new trend holds instead that the purpose of companies is the solution. Historically, state concessions for corporations were granted only if a public utility could be established. Yet the concession system faded away, and the targeted pursuit of general interest was assigned to antitrust, securities regulation, and other public laws. The chapter covers the current debate on corporate purpose, stakeholder participation, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) in the light of history and comparative law (in France, Germany, and the EU Corporate, Sustainability Due Diligence Directive). It analyses the current economic, social science, and policy arguments and the various legislative options (enlightened shareholder value, constituency statutes, balancing of interest, ESG, corporate sustainability due diligence, and climate change legislation). The most important challenge is to making stakeholder governance work. Enforcement options are disclosure and auditing, enterprise law, and public and private enforcement. © Jens- Hinrich Binder, Klaus J. Hopt, and Thilo Kuntz 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Potential implications of carbon dioxide removal for the sustainable development goals,"As the international community’s best expression of a collective vision of a desirable future, the 2015 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) present a framework against which to assess the broader impact of emerging technologies. Implications of technologies and practices for removing CO2 from the atmosphere (CDR) are not fully understood and have not yet been mapped against the full range of SDGs. CDR is widely seen as necessary to achieve the Paris Agreement’s global goal of limiting warming to 1.5-2°C, yet local geographical, socio-economic, and political interdependencies are often overlooked. This review synthesizes the best available understandings of potential implications of CDR options aiming to complement emissions reductions. It seeks to identify effects on and interactions between specific social, environmental, and policy environments, in which various CDR options could be pursued. Climate change mitigation and co-benefits from CDR could significantly benefit SDGs, yet poorly designed CDR policies could also challenge SDGs. Specific CDR options could generate conflicts over land, water, biomass, or electric power resources, and exclude communities from policy benefits with negative cascading effects for a range of SDGs. In the literature, implications of CDR activities on sustainable development are derived from current pilot activities, inferred from similar practices already operational or model outputs regarding land, energy, or material requirements. Important gaps remain. We identify questions for further disciplinary and inter- or transdisciplinary work strengthening understanding of how CDR could either support or threaten the achievement of the SDGs. Key policy insights CO2 removal (CDR) appears essential for limiting warming to well below 2°C; such stabilization of global climate is a precondition for at least partially achieving the SDGs. CDR options can generate positive and negative local/regional impacts on various SDGs via physical, social, economic, and political channels. None of these options are universally ‘good’ or ‘bad’. The scale of implementation of CDR and related impacts are highly dependent on policy design and national planning processes. More research is needed to clarify how policy design can allow CDR options to generate synergies between, and prevent harm across, multiple SDGs. © 2020 The Author(s).

"Food production, ecosystem services and biodiversity: We can't have it all everywhere","Debate about how sustainable intensification and multifunctionality might be implemented continues, but there remains little understanding as to what extent they are achievable in arable landscapes. Policies that influence agronomic decisions are rarely made with an appreciation of the trade-offs that exist between food production, biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision. We present an approach that can reveal such trade-offs when used to assess current and future policy options that affect agricultural inputs (e.g. pesticides, nutrients) and practices. In addition, by demonstrating it in a pesticide policy context, we show how safeguarding a range of ecosystem services may have serious implications for UK food security. We suggest that policy change is most usefully implemented at a landscape scale to promote multifunctionality, tailoring pesticide risk assessment and incentives for management that support bundles of ecosystem services to specific landscape contexts. In some instances tough trade-offs may need to be accepted. However, our approach can ensure that current knowledge is used to inform policy decisions for progress towards a more balanced food production system. © 2016 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
An ecotourism perspective on billfish fisheries,"Tourism is a major source of earnings, supplemental to and possibly replacing those of agriculture and extractive industries in many regions of the world. Fish stocks and the recreational fishing opportunities they afford are one of many natural resource based attractions that lure tourists to various destinations. Billfish species (blue marlin, black marlin, white marlin, striped marlin and sailfish) are a major tourism attraction worldwide for recreational fishing enthusiasts. Increasingly, billfish anglers are attempting to act responsibly toward billfish resources. Many have practised catch and release philosophy and conservation techniques for some time. Many billfish anglers contribute money and time to fisheries conservation organisations and efforts. Can fishing be considered as a form of ecotourism? This paper reviews definitions of ecotourism to distil six criteria: natural resource based, specific clientele, evidence of responsibility toward the resource, economic support for resource conservation, economic advantages of appreciative use, and social responsibility to local economy. Evidence is presented that some forms of billfishing meet these criteria and can be considered as ecotourism. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Natural capital evaluation in the FutureCity of Shimokawa, Northern Japan, based on forest economics","We have pragmatically but accurately evaluated the natural capital of a small northern town, Shimokawa, Hokkaido, Japan. The key industries are forestry, wood manufacturing, and agriculture. From an environmental perspective, Shimokawa was nominated as a Japanese FutureCity. Consequently, the total natural capital value (NCV) of the forest and agricultural lands was calculated to be 1.326 billion USD/year (or 24,161 USD/ha/year) and 44 million USD/year (or 19,692 USD/ha/year), respectively, in 2012. The sum of these NCVs was more than 7 times greater than the yearly gross production of the town, although the forest had a higher NCV because of the larger area (54,862 ha for forest area), compared with 2953 ha for agricultural area. This substantial NCV is mainly generated by sustainable forest management. The timber account showed that the annual tree growth was greater than the annual harvest of trees. The CO2 account derived from a one-year calculation showed that the town served as a CO2 sink at 107,249 t-CO2/year due to the large amount of annual tree growth and CO2 storage in the harvested wood products even if CO2 was emitted from industries and households. The forestry and wood manufacturing industries, as well as agriculture, created socioeconomic effects for the townspeople, ranging from job creation, study tours, and social welfare. This NCV accounting for Shimokawa town ensures the sustainable use of valuable environmental assets and will help other communities recognize their own NCV accounts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability-Related Supply Chain Risks: Conceptualization and Management,"There is ample anecdotal evidence suggesting that firms can experience serious losses from social, ecological or ethical problems that exist in their supply chains. So far, however, research on supply chain risk management has largely neglected these sustainability issues. Most importantly, little is known about how sustainability issues manifest themselves as risks and how they create losses for focal firms. Without an in-depth understanding of this materialization process, conceptualizations of sustainability risks will remain vague and effective management frameworks cannot be developed. We address this important research gap by means of a transdisciplinary approach and provide a concise description of how sustainability issues in supply chains materialize as risks for focal firms. Building on this mechanism and drawing on stakeholder theory, we develop a conceptualization of sustainability risks which lays the basis for future investigations in this respective field. In addition, we devise a viable management concept for sustainability-related supply chain risks. The proposed concept can help firms to mitigate sustainability issues in global supply chains, thus making them less vulnerable to losses resulting from these risks. Its application will also foster sustainability standards within supply chains. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.",Not About Sufficiency
Irrigation modernization and the efficiency paradox: a meta-study through the lens of Networks of Action Situations,"Infrastructure and technology investments that increase water-use efficiency (also called modernization investments) have become one of the most preferred solutions to cope with water scarcity in the context of climate change, increase productivity to satisfy growing demand, and save water to maintain ecosystems. In many cases, however, the higher efficiencies have led to more, instead of less, water consumption. This is generally known as the efficiency paradox or rebound effect. Understanding the processes behind the efficiency paradox remains a difficult task, given the variety of variables that either directly or indirectly factor into farmers’ water-use decisions and the strategic nature of many of those. This is even more the case when water is managed collectively by water-user associations, as in many irrigation systems worldwide. In order to better understand this complexity, our study applies the Networks of Action Situations approach to 37 studies of irrigation modernization investments in collectively managed irrigation systems. Through a systematic case review method, we identify 12 different action situations and 192 institutional, physical, and informational linkages that connect them. Although some studies report linkages between the modernization-investment and water-saving decision situations, many others relate them to situations typically associated with the collective management of irrigation systems (like the water application or infrastructure maintenance situations). A number of these situations, also including the water-saving situation, involve collective action problems that need to be integrated in current analyses. The solution towards more water saving may indeed benefit from a more active involvement of irrigation associations, given their proven capacity to promote collective action among farmers vis-à-vis other irrigation management situations. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Local biofuel production for rural electrification potentially promotes development but threatens food security in Laela, Western Tanzania","The impacts of biofuel production and the adequacy of the associated production structures are controversial matters despite a projected medium-term growth rate increase. Concurrently, electricity is increasingly perceived as a prerequisite for development. In this article, we assess the potential impacts of the local production of biofuels for electricity production on development and the food supply in the village of Laela in Western Tanzania. Based on a village survey, focus group discussions and expert interviews, we calculated the potential food security effects on four different economic types of farmer groups. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the potential use of sunflower and groundnut oils as substitutes for fossil fuels for the production of electricity. The baseline framework is based on a comparison of crop production data with current fossil fuel consumption. The ex-ante scenarios assess the gap between the estimated yield losses and the increasing fuel demand through 2015. These comparative analyses of schemes in which vegetable oil production replaces a given level of crop production showed that replacing food crops with crops producing biofuel will most likely impact local food security negatively, causing increased hunger, especially for the poorest farmers and even if climate change is not considered. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Not About Sufficiency
Watershed management: An approach for landslide risk reduction through integrated landuse planning,"Landslides pose considerable risks to the environment. They threaten the lives of people and livestock and destroy land-use systems and agricultural production. This has heavy impacts on the livelihoods of affected people, their economic situation and food security. In developing countries, poor and marginalized people are often forced to settle and to cultivate land in hazard-prone areas due to population pressure and, accordingly, the effects of landslides on lives and assets can be disastrous. People and their land-use systems, on the other hand, can influence the occurrence of landslides. Besides the physical causes and triggers of landslides such as geological failures, erosion processes and heavy rainfall events, activities such as forest harvesting, road construction, mining, unsustainable agricultural practices and overgrazing have been found to have an impact on shallow landslides. Their influence on deep-rooted landslides is, however, minimal. Most of the current approaches in landslide risk reduction follow a mainly technical path and neglect the human factor. Integrated approaches that take into account people and all aspects of local livelihoods, including socio-economic issues, agriculture, pasture, forestry and hydrology are needed in order to address this complex problem. To organize spatially the different land-uses and promote the implementation of suitable practices, one ideal approach is watershed management. It allows addressing upstream-downstream linkages, such as landslides, and provides a framework for sound land use planning. Adapted landuse systems and adequate natural resource management can reduce the potential for landslides and, especially, mitigate the processes leading to increased landslide hazards, such as gully erosion. Experience shows that often the underlying causes of unsustainable land-use are social or economic and that sustainable land-use practices are not adopted because they are socially not acceptable and/or economically not viable. Diversification of livelihoods, vegetation cover types and crop species - the mixing of different land uses in general - increases the resilience of local farmers and may improve the way natural resources and corresponding livelihoods can be rehabilitated after landslide events. Further, the sustainable management of natural resources and the diversification of livelihoods increase people's food security and have positive effects on water resources. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",Not About Sufficiency
Green urban landscapes and school-level academic performance,"The growing disconnect between humans and nature has implications for human well-being. Research has linked exposure to nature with various benefits including improved focus, vitality, productivity, and reduced stress, factors that may enhance the academic performance of individual students. In intensively-urbanized landscapes with few natural elements this effect could, via aggregated population-level impacts, influence the academic performance of entire populations, negatively affecting educational attainment and propagating urban poverty. Designing urban environments to provide increased interaction with natural landscape elements such as vegetation could mitigate this effect, benefiting the academic growth and future success of urban students. Recent studies support this idea; however, this effect is poorly understood, hindering the management of urban environments to improve educational outcomes. This study explores relationships between urban nature and the academic performance of urban schools using the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota, USA as a case study area. We used regression analysis to identify relationships among environmental variables on and around school campuses (i.e., tree cover, vegetated land covers, water) and four measures of population-level third-grade reading and mathematics success, accounting for school socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Contrary to expectations, we found a positive relationship between impervious surfaces and reading performance, while relationships between two vegetated land covers (grass, shrub) and water bodies and both mathematics and reading academic success were non-significant. We found a significant, positive relationship between tree cover and reading performance, suggesting that initiatives aimed at increasing tree cover in student environments could support academic success. © 2016",Not About Sufficiency
Redistributive Impacts of Civil War: The Case of Côte d'Ivoire,"Many least developed countries (LDCs) are plagued by recurring conflict. Conflict impedes sustainable development through various channels, creating conditions fomenting further conflict. Conflict has redistributive impacts, particularly when it erupts in resource-rich countries. Between 2002 and 2011, Côte d'Ivoire faced off two spells of civil war (2002–2007 and 2010–2011) along geographic, religious and ethnic lines. We investigate how the civil war and the associated changes in the political balance impinged on economic outcomes of the affected groups at various income quantiles. Growth incidence curves before–after conflict illustrate the income changes of the respective socioeconomic groups. Accounting for distortions due to individual selection and general-equilibrium spillovers, unconditional quantile regressions fitted by the means of recentered influence functions are used to isolate between-group income gaps attributable to conflict. The results on microdata from 2002 to 2018 Household Living Standards Surveys confirm that as the political tide shifted, the economic fortunes of the affected groups turned. Previously marginalized communities—the northern, Gour and Mandé ethnic, and non-Christian groups—have bridged some of their disadvantage related to their endowments and the market returns on them. These effects are clearest in the upper half of the income spectrum, leading to important changes in social order. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Egypt at the crossroads.,"Egypt is the location of the 1994 International Population and Development Conference. Conditions in Egypt due to expected population growth rates are anticipated as headed for ""ecological breakdown."" There is loss of prime agricultural land to urban expansion and difficulties in providing employment and vital services. The fertility decline to 4 children/family is still inadequate to meet resource needs; a 2-child family norm must be adopted because the country can barely meet the needs of 90 million people. Cairo is becoming a mega-city of squatter settlements and slums. Population densities approach 140,000/sq. kilometers. The family planning (FP) program receives top political support. The contraceptive prevalence rate has risen to just over 50%, a 10% increase since 1988. Egypt is the first Muslim country to surpass the 50% mark. Credit for this accomplishment is given to public information and education campaigns to reduce family size, expansion of maternal and child health services and FP, the cooperation of Muslim clerics, and better educated women. Nongovernmental organizations have played an active role in FP. The future challenge is to improve services and outreach and keep up with demand. Attitudes in rural areas have changed, so that desiring children to help with farm work is the exception. Progress on arresting environmental destruction has not been as successful. There are still poor irrigation practices. The breadbasket the Nile River sustained no longer exists; Egypt is a net importer of food. Water shortages and water quality limit productivity. 57.2 billion cu. meters out of 58.4 billion cu. meters of freshwater available from the Nile River are used primarily for irrigation of the 17.6 million hectares of agricultural land along the river and its delta. Salts have polluted the river from fertilizers and pesticides and municipal and industrial wastes. Industrial dumping is illegal, but continues.

Sense of purpose and food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought new attention to the issues of food insecurity faced by individuals throughout the United States, a stressor exacerbated by disruptions to work status and supply chains. The burden of food insecurity likely carries consequences for whether individuals feel capable of pursuing their broad goals and life engagements; put differently, food insecurity may pose a threat to people perceiving a sense of purpose in life. The current study tested this claim across three samples taken during 2020 (n = 2009), 2021 (n = 1666), and 2022 (n = 1975). Participants completed inventories for perceived food insecurity, sense of purpose, depressive symptoms, and anxiety, among other measures. Results found consistent negative associations between food insecurity and sense of purpose across all three samples. In addition, food insecurity moderated associations between sense of purpose and depressive or anxiety symptoms. Sense of purpose was more strongly negatively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms for those participants who reported no food insecurity. That said, sense of purpose remained negatively associated with psychological distress even among those reporting food insecurity. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Natural resources management and food security in the context of sustainable development,"This paper elaborates on the inseparable link between sustainability of natural resources and food security. A strategic framework that envisages conservation, improvement and sustainable uses of natural resources is proposed which meets the essential requirements for food security. Sustainability has traditionally been accepted as encompassing three dimensions, namely environment, economics and society but it is necessary to widen this approach for a more complete understanding of this term. Environmental degradation curtails ecosystem services, leading to impoverishment of vulnerable communities and insecurity. Food, whether derived from land or sea, is a product of complex environmental linkages, and biodiversity has a pivotal role to play in producing it. Technology, production methods and management requirements are different for food derived from land and sea, but essentially all foodstuffs utilize environmental resources whose sustainability is crucial for food security. This analysis necessitates consideration of the basic concepts of sustainable development and food security, the strength of the link between these and differences in the patterns of sustainable management of agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture. The growing role of genetically engineered organisms has been included because of the immense possibilities these offer for maximizing food production despite the environmental and ethical concerns raised.",Not About Sufficiency
Water and Energy Nexus: Impact of Energy Development on Water Resources,"Water is an essential natural resource that impacts all aspects of life-clean and abundant supplies of water are vital for supporting food production; public health; industrial, mineral, and energy development; and a healthy environment. Water is an integral part of energy and mineral extraction, production, and generation. It is used directly in hydroelectric power generation and is used extensively for thermoelectric power plant cooling and associated air emissions control, for growing and refining biofuels, for oil and natural gas (NG) refining, and for energy resource transportation. Water is also used or generated in mineral and energy resource extraction, such as hydraulic fracturing, oil and NG produced water generation, coal and uranium mining and processing, and mineral mining operations, including processing, dust control, and mine dewatering. Energy development can also impact water quality in surface water and groundwater, including thermal impacts from thermoelectric power plant cooling water thermal discharges, degradation of water quality from oil and gas development produced water leaks and disposal issues, energy refining waste water and refining by-product water impacts, and mine water drainage contamination issues. Unfortunately, unsustainable uses of water resources, population dynamics and migration patterns, rapid economic growth in many developing countries, and climate change impacts on precipitation and the environment are all altering freshwater resources and available water supplies across the globe. These issues are exacerbating the water needs and water quality impacts of energy development. Therefore, as nations try to balance the efficient use of water to support agricultural, human health, energy, industrial, and ecological needs in the coming decades, it is clear that the water footprint, like the carbon footprint, will become a critical factor in determining sustainable and resilient energy development worldwide. © 2017 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental sustainability of Finnish pork production: life cycle assessment of climate change and water scarcity impacts,"Purpose: The degrading impacts of livestock production on the environment are well acknowledged. Although ruminants are much studied due to their large contribution to climate change impact, monogastrics are also known to carry a significant load, and mitigation options need investigation. Here, the climate change impact and water scarcity impact of Finnish pork production was investigated using the life cycle assessment approach. Methods: As the importance of communicating reliable environmental information has been acknowledged in the EU, methods and guidance for this purpose have been developed. Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules have also been published for several food product categories, although not yet for meat. Here, the life cycle assessment methods were used based on PEFCR guidance and the draft version of red meat PEFCR guidance to achieve a reliable, transparent and comparable assessment. Results: Finnish pork production resulted in a climate change impact of 3.6 kg CO2 eq. kgCW−1 and a water scarcity impact of 0.69 m3 eq. kgCW−1. The largest contribution to the climate change impact came from feed crop production, with an impact of 43%. Land-use changes were included, and their contribution to the Finnish pork climate change impact was 3%. Similarly, in the water scarcity impact, feed crop production was a major contributor, with 41% from fattening pig feed production. Significant contributions to both categories also came from piglet production, including feed crop production, and to the climate change impact from manure storage. Conclusions: Finnish production was seen to already largely utilise sidestreams and domestic feed ingredients, although, e.g. soybean is still used. Based on the results, in mitigating the environmental impacts of Finnish pork production, attention should especially be paid to the resource-efficient production of domestic feed crops and reduced use of organic soils. As current assessment models are unable to grasp the impacts of regenerative farming techniques, the development of LCA methods is also required. Water scarcity impact was seen to be largely affected by the utilisation of feed crops originating from water-scarce countries. As a mitigation measure, the procurement of these feed crops and ingredients should therefore be directed to water-abundant areas and from production which does not depend on irrigation water or the extensive use of synthetic inputs. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency

Nonlinear response of nitric oxide fluxes to fertilizer inputs and the impacts of agricultural intensification on tropospheric ozone pollution in Kenya,"Crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa remain stagnant at 1 ton ha−1, and 260 million people lack access to adequate food resources. Order-of-magnitude increases in fertilizer use are seen as a critical step in attaining food security. This increase represents an unprecedented input of nitrogen (N) to African ecosystems and will likely be accompanied by increased soil emissions of nitric oxide (NO). NO is a precursor to tropospheric ozone, an air pollutant and greenhouse gas. Emissions of NO from soils occur primarily during denitrification and nitrification, and N input rates are a key determinant of emission rates. We established experimental maize plots in western Kenya to allow us to quantify the response function relating NO flux to N input rate during the main 2011 and 2012 growing seasons. NO emissions followed a sigmoid response to fertilizer inputs and have emission factors under 1% for the roughly two-month measurement period in each year, although linear and step relationships could not be excluded in 2011. At fertilization rates above 100 kg N ha−1, NO emissions increased without a concomitant increase in yields. We used the geos-chem chemical transport model to evaluate local impacts of increased NO emissions on tropospheric ozone concentrations. Mean 4-hour afternoon tropospheric ozone concentrations in Western Kenya increased by up to roughly 2.63 ppbv under fertilization rates of 150 kg N ha−1 or higher. Using AOT40, a metric for assessing crop damage from ozone, we find that the increased ozone concentrations result in an increase in AOT40 exposure of approximately 110 ppbh for inputs of 150 kg N ha−1 during the March–April–May crop growing season, compared with unfertilized simulations, with negligible impacts on crop productivity. Our results suggest that it may be possible to manage Kenyan agricultural systems for high yields while avoiding substantial impacts on air quality. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

The impact of healthier dietary scenarios on the global blue water scarcity footprint of food consumption in the UK,"Large quantities of water are required to produce the food for a nation, some of which is derived within the country and some associated with imported food commodities. In this study, we consider the spatially explicit potential impact of alternative healthier eating scenarios for the UK on global blue water scarcity using the concept of a water scarcity footprint. The water required to produce the food consumed by the UK was estimated at 52.6Gm3/y of which 93% is from rainfall at the point where it falls and 7% is ""blue"" water withdrawn from surface and ground water resources. Five alternative healthier diets were considered and the impact on the blue water scarcity footprint was modest (ranging from -3% to +2% compared to baseline). However more significant impacts were projected on the geographical distribution of the blue water scarcity footprint. This study has shown that if current trade patterns continue, policies to promote healthier eating in the UK may contribute to increased blue water scarcity at home and in other parts of the world. The use of virtual water estimates and global datasets of water scarcity can help to understand the potential environmental impacts of alternative diets. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

An approach for the application of the Ecological Footprint as environmental indicator in the textile sector,"The Ecological Footprint (EF) is a recent concept which has widely been used as an indicator of environmental sustainability applied to individual lifestyles, regions, nations or even the world. Recently, its application to enterprises has been proposed. In the present study, a textile tailoring plant has been analysed. The overall purpose of this study was to develop a tool useful for evaluating the environmental impact evolution due to the performance of the plant, as well as for comparing the environmental behaviour of different tailoring processes. Therefore, the selected data were those from the manufacturing work. Data were divided in three main categories: energy, resources and waste. The principal contribution to the final EF (expressed in hectares of land) was the resources category, mainly due to the high value associated to the cloth. The consumed energy was the second contributor, while the waste category remained in third place. The final outcomes were divided by the production rates to obtain a comparable relative index, easy to be interpreted by the different stakeholders. This is of special importance for a Company involved in Corporate Social Responsibility and thus meant to have a general communication strategy. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Sustainable development, demography and sexual and reproductive health: Inseparable linkages and their policy implications","The greatest challenge today is to meet the needs of current and future generations, of a large and growing world population, without imposing catastrophic pressures on the natural environment. Meeting this challenge depends on decisive policy changes in three areas: more inclusive economic growth, greener economic growth, and population policies. This article focuses on efforts to address and harness demographic changes for sustainable development, which are largely outside the purview of the current debate. Efforts to this end must be based on the recognition that demographic changes are the cumulative result of individual choices and opportunities, and that demographic changes are best addressed through policies that enlarge these choices and opportunities, with a focus on ensuring unrestricted and universal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services, empowering women to fully participate in social, economic and political life, and investing in the education of the younger generation beyond the primary level. The article provides a strong argument for why the Programme of Action that was agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) 20 years ago continues to hold important implications and lessons for the formulation of the post-2015 development agenda, which is expected to supersede the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). © 2014 Reproductive Health Matters.",Not About Sufficiency
"Climate change and pastoralism: Impacts, consequences and adaptation","The authors discuss the main climate change impacts on pastoralist societies, including those on rangelands, livestock and other natural resources, and their extended repercussions on food security, incomes and vulnerability. The impacts of climate change on the rangelands of the globe and on the vulnerability of the people who inhabit them will be severe and diverse, and will require multiple, simultaneous responses. In higher latitudes, the removal of temperature constraints might increase pasture production and livestock productivity, but in tropical arid lands, the impacts are highly location specific, but mostly negative. The authors outline several adaptation options, ranging from implementing new technical practices and diversifying income sources to finding institutional support and introducing new marketmechanisms, all of which are pivotalfor enhancing the capacity of pastoralists to adapt to climate variability and change. Due to the dynamism of all the changes affecting pastoral societies, strategies that lock pastoral societies into specified development pathways could be maladaptive. Flexible and evolving combinations of practices and policies are the key to successful pastoral adaptation.",Not About Sufficiency
Water Sowing and Harvesting (WS&H) for Sustainable Management in Ecuador: A Review,"Water Sowing and Harvesting (WS&H) is an ancestral knowledge widely used as a sustainable technique in water management. This study aims to analyse the importance, promotion, and cultural heritage of WS&H techniques through a literature review in Ecuador, considering applications of ancestral techniques by region (coastal, Andean and insular) with a strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats (SWOTs) analysis and a focus group for a strategy proposal of the water supply. The methodology of this study includes the following: (i) an analysis of the evolution of WS&H studies in Ecuador; (ii) a presentation of WS&H techniques and their applications; and (iii) the contribution of WS&H to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), complemented by a SWOTs analysis. The results show that, in Ecuador, WS&H is a method of Nature-based Solutions (NbSs) applied to the problems of water scarcity and is affordable, ecological, and has high efficiency, improving agricultural productivity and guaranteeing water supply for human consumption. The Manglaralto coastal aquifer, a case study in the coastal region of Ecuador, involves WS&H management and artificial aquifer recharge. WS&H structures became a reference for the sustainable development of rural communities that can be replicated nationally and internationally as a resilient alternative to water scarcity and a global climate emergency, contributing to the SDGs of UNESCO. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of soil moisture on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) phytochemicals,"Water scarcity is detrimental for agricultural productivity and modifies food quality. Common bean is an important foodstuff mainly produced in regions prone to drought. Therefore, it is important to grow cultivars adapted to restricted irrigation whose grain is high in health related phytochemicals without compromising seed yield. The aim was to determine the effect of restricted irrigation (RI), terminal drought (TD) and irrigation during the whole cycle (IWC) treatments upon seed yield, and seed's phytochemicals and functional properties of two pinto bean cultivars, Rarámuri and Pinto Saltillo (PS). Compared to IWC, TD decreased seed yield, 13 % for Rarámuri and 20 % for PS, whereas RI increased yield by 33 % for Rarámuri and 5% for PS. A principal component analysis demonstrated that phytochemicals such as oligosaccharides, some phenolics, protein and resistant starch, differentiated the RI treatment from the TD and IWC. Moreover, a partial least square-discriminant analysis indicated that some compounds were associated to the inhibitory capacity against digestive enzymes, like α-amylase, -glucosidase and pancreatic lipase. These results indicate that RI can be used to improve bean seed phytochemicals and functional quality without penalizing seed yield. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
Estimating the causal impact of proximity to gold and copper mines on respiratory diseases in Chilean children: An application of targeted maximum likelihood estimation,"In a town located in a desert area of Northern Chile, gold and copper open–pit mining is carried out involving explosive processes. These processes are associated with increased dust exposure, which might affect children’s respiratory health. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the causal attributable risk of living close to the mines on asthma or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis risk burden in children. Data on the prevalence of respiratory diseases and potential confounders were available from a cross-sectional survey carried out in 2009 among 288 (response: 69%) children living in the community. The proximity of the children’s home addresses to the local gold and copper mine was calculated using geographical positioning systems. We applied targeted maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the causal attributable risk (CAR) for asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and both outcomes combined. Children living more than the first quartile away from the mines were used as the unexposed group. Based on the estimated CAR, a hypothetical intervention in which all children lived at least one quartile away from the copper mine would decrease the risk of rhinoconjunctivitis by 4.7 percentage points (CAR: –4.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): –8.4; –0.11); and 4.2 percentage points (CAR: –4.2; 95% CI: –7.9;–0.05) for both outcomes combined. Overall, our results suggest that a hypothetical intervention intended to increase the distance between the place of residence of the highest exposed children would reduce the prevalence of respiratory disease in the community by around four percentage points. This approach could help local policymakers in the development of efficient public health strategies. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
Voluntary agreements to promote the use of reclaimed water at tordera river basin,"The voluntary agreement to promote the use of reclaimed water is an economic policy instrument (EPI) which focuses on improving water management by using reclaimed water. Following a win-win strategy, this EPI was implemented in the Tordera river basin (Spain), an area with endemic water scarcity problems and high competition among users for water resources. The assessment of the EPI suggests that significant positive outcomes have achieved from an environmental and economic point of view. Thus, the demand of freshwater has decreased and the availability of water is guaranteed even during summer period allowing therefore for the maintenance of economic activities (agriculture and golf course) and for reducing overexploitation of aquifers. The social acceptance of the use of reclaimed water and the institutional framework (regulation and previous experiences) were two key factors for the success of this EPI. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Not About Sufficiency
Future scenarios for the value of ecosystem services in Latin America and the Caribbean to 2050,"We explore the implications of four scenarios for the value of ecosystem services provided by terrestrial ecosystems to the year 2050 for Latin America and the Caribbean, based on the Great Transition Initiative scenarios and previous studies at a global scale. We estimated the current ecosystem services value (ESV) of the 33 countries that make up this region to be $US15.3 trillion/year. By modelling the four future scenarios, we estimated that there is a potential for ESV to decrease to $8 trillion/year (for the “Fortress World” scenario) or an increase to $19 trillion/year (for the “Great Transition” scenario), a difference of a 47% decrease or a 25% increase. Our results indicate that adopting appropriate policies could greatly enhance human well-being and sustainability in the region and help to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2020 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency

A collaborative transformation beyond coal and cars? Co-creation and corporatism in the german energy and mobility transitions,"In this article, we critically discuss the role of collaboration in Germany's path towards a post-carbon economy. We consider civic movements and novel forms of collaboration as a potentially transformative challenger to the predominant approach of corporatist collaboration in the mobility and energy sectors. However, while trade unions and employer organizations provide a permanent and active arena for policy-oriented collaboration, civil society groups cannot rely on an equivalently institutionalized corridor to secure policy impact and public resonance. In that sense, conventional forms of collaboration tend to hinder the transformation towards a post-carbon economy. Collaboration in the German corporatist setting is thus, from a sustainability perspective, simultaneously a problem and a solution. We argue for more institutionalized corridors between civil society and state institutions. Co-creation, as we would like to call this methodical approach to collaborating, can be anchored within the environmental and industrial policy arenas. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Benefits and co-benefits of urban green infrastructure for sustainable cities: six current and emerging themes,"Integrating urban green infrastructure (UGI) into cities is receiving increasing attention owing to its potential to provide various urban ecosystem services (UES). This review assesses the multifaceted services of UGI as benefits and co-benefits. By combining systematic and narrative review processes, we aim to synthesise existing knowledge along six current themes and identify research gaps. A total of 690 peer-reviewed articles published during 2000–2020 from Web of Science were selected, followed by bibliometric and full-text analysis. Based on the frequency of appearance in the network visualisation of keywords, six themes of current trends were identified, namely: (1) benefits of UGI as UES; (2) mitigating climate and urban climate impacts by UGI; (3) UGI contribution to sustainable development goals; (4) reconceptualising greenspaces as ‘safe havens’; (5) public acknowledgement and supportive governance for UGI; and (6) rethinking the operationalisability of UGI. The first two themes represent existing focus on categories of ecosystem services, the next two encompass broader emerging co-benefits and the last two focus on how to operationalise UGI and support widespread adoption and implementation. Within Theme 2, the most frequently discussed service with the largest number of research, we conducted a detailed analysis of the methods and content focus in the existing literature. Through a narrative review, we identified 15 research gaps throughout these 6 themes. This review provides a comprehensive overview for urban researchers and practitioners to inform the integration of urban green infrastructure into urban planning and management. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
NGO Participation in Global Governance Institutions: International and Domestic Drivers of Engagement,"Global governance institutions (GGIs) increasingly rely upon nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for expertise, promotion of rules and standards, and democratic legitimacy. Yet NGO participation in GGIs is unevenly distributed by country of origin. This chapter examines patterns of NGO participation in GGIs, and how participation is shaped by incentives and pressures at global and national levels. It maps NGO participation by country of origin across 42 GGIs based on the roles that GGIs grant to NGOs and by variations in domestic conditions of income level and political regime type. To delve more deeply into domestic factors, the chapter provides an exploratory statistical regression based on NGO participation in two major GGIs, the UN Global Compact on corporate social responsibility and the UNFCCC Conferences of Parties on climate change. The evidence suggests that participation patterns reflect both the varying institutional design of GGIs and NGO capacity linked to domestic conditions. NGOs with constrained capacity due to domestic factors gravitate toward GGIs that offer the most significant roles for NGOs, with the greatest opportunity to influence policy. This indicates that domestic civil society factors beyond level of economic development and regime type shape NGO participation at the global level. Analysis of this wide-ranging set of GGIs provides more general confirmation of patterns of NGO engagement in global governance previously identified in studies limited to particular issue sectors or cases. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Distributional health impacts of electricity imports in the United States,"The electric grid is evolving rapidly in response to climate change. As renewables are incorporated, more interconnection of the grid is expected. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from fossil-fuel generation causes adverse health impacts, including thousands of premature deaths each year in the United States. It is well understood that PM2.5 exposure can occur at great distances from pollutant sources, but insufficient work has been done to understand the role of grid interconnection and trade in causing pollution-related mortality. Regions with clean generation can import electricity from regions with highly polluting generation sources, allowing them to benefit from the electricity consumption while people in other regions suffer the associated health damages. We use flow tracing and consumption-based accounting to characterize the health damages from exposure to PM2.5 from electricity imports. We find that 8% of our estimated premature deaths from electricity consumption in the United States are due to electricity imports. There is large geographic heterogeneity, with the most impacts occurring in the Midwest. While the West Coast has much cleaner generation and lower impacts overall, in many West Coast Balancing Areas, more than 50% of the estimated premature mortality associated with electricity consumption is caused by electricity imports, with some groups experiencing larger impacts than others. © 2022 The Author(s).

Climate vulnerability and fertilizer use–panel evidence from Tanzanian maize farmers,"Chemical fertilizers can significantly improve agricultural productivity but their environmental sustainability is much debated. This paper contributes to a growing body of research on the drivers of chemical fertilizer use under climate vulnerability. We study the impact of climate risk (measured as rainfall abundance, rainfall variability, temperature and temperature shock) on fertilizer use by Tanzanian maize farmers using Probit regression analysis on spatially disaggregated agronomic panel survey data for the years 2016 and 2017. Our results show that fertilizer use is extremely sensitive to climate risks, even when accounting for actually observed input prices, the main contribution of this study. Our findings suggest that as the climate crisis escalates with erratic rainfalls and warmer climate, chemical fertilizers will become increasingly less reliable to ensure food security for a growing population as farmers’ fertilizer adoption decision is highly responsive to climate variability. This lends support to arguments that perfunctory promotion of chemical fertilizers is at odds with sustainable intensification agricultural policies. © 2023 The Author(s).

Framework for selecting and setting boundaries for social sustainability indicators in a life cycle perspective,"The historical consumption of natural resources to fulfil the demands of the growing population have resulted in severe environmental degradation. Therefore, understanding the role of fulfilment of human needs and the social aspect of sustainability is crucial in the transition towards more sustainable societies. We present a methodological framework for a social sustainability assessment that includes a full life cycle perspective and is based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The framework comprehends operationalisation of the social aspects of the SDGs and includes means/tools to achieve the environmental targets through a six-step guide. A demonstration of the method's application is given by applying the six-step framework to a case study: the Danish building sector focusing on SDGs 3 Good health and well-being, 7 Affordable and clean energy, 8 Decent work and economic growth, 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure, 10 Reduced inequalities and 11 Sustainable cities and communities, 12 Responsible consumption and production, 13 Climate action and 15 Life on land. The final social indicators and the associated targets indicate in which areas a building is absolute social sustainable and in which areas the social performance falls short. The developed framework supports an informed and transparent selection of relevant social indicators across the life cycle while setting objective absolute targets. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
A holistic definition of healthy traditional harvest practices for rural Indigenous communities in Interior Alaska,"Traditional harvest practices of the harvesting and sharing of fish, wildlife, and other wild resources are an integral source of food security that support physical, mental, and spiritual wellness, education, socio-economic development, and cultural identity of Indigenous communities in Interior Alaska. Many significant changes, including climate change, are impacting this way of life and challenging secure access to foods vital for sustenance and cultural preservation. We use a case study approach to develop a holistic and place-based definition of traditional harvest practices of Indigenous communities in rural Interior Alaska that expands upon commonly accepted definitions of food security. This definition emphasizes the role of ecological health, culture, and decision-making power in strengthening food security and sovereignty. We also highlight how multistakeholer partnerships foster capacity building that can support communities in their efforts to advocate for food security and sovereignty. © 2019 by the Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Health–environment efficiency of diets shows nonlinear trends over 1990–2011,"The coupled impacts of diets on health and the environment must be considered when setting food policy targets and evaluating the effectiveness of specific interventions. A newly proposed health–environment efficiency indicator applied to 195 countries over two decades can aid this process, revealing important trends and drivers. © The Author(s) 2024.; Understanding the impacts of diets on health and the environment, as well as their association with socio-economic development, is key to operationalize and monitor food systems shifts. Here we propose a health–environment efficiency indicator defined as a ratio of health benefits and four key food-related environmental impacts (greenhouse gas emissions, scarcity-weighted water withdrawal, acidifying and eutrophying emissions) to assess how diets have performed in supporting healthy lives in relation to environmental pollution and resource consumption across 195 countries from 1990 to 2011. We find that the health–environment efficiency of each environmental input follows a nonlinear path along the Socio-Demographic Index gradient representing different development levels. Health–environment efficiency first increases thanks to the elimination of child and maternal malnutrition through greater food supply, then decreases driven by additional environmental impacts from a shift to animal products, and finally shows a slow growth in some developed countries again as they shift towards healthier diets. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatiotemporal evolution pattern and heterogeneity of resource-based city resilience in China,"Resource-based cities (RBCs) encompass the east, middle, and west of China, covering an important economic hinterland.

The results vivid showed sustainable development positively influenced growing-type RBCs also showed that the overall RBC resilience coupling coordination degree improved throughout the study period (2009–2019), and that the evolution of RBC resilience demonstrated good convergence characteristics. Furthermore, a distinct gap is evident between high resilience-level growing RBCs and relatively low-level regenerative RBCs. All RBCs will eventually converge to the third level with a higher level of coupling coordination. However, compared with the traditional Markov chain, the transition probability of the spatial Markov chain is reduced due to the influence of surrounding cities.

Multi-driving paths for the coupling coordinated development of agricultural carbon emission reduction and sequestration and food security: A configurational analysis based on dynamic fsQCA,"Exploring the coupling coordinated development of carbon emission reduction and sequestration (CERS) and food security in agriculture is conducive to mitigating climate change and achieving sustainable development goals. However, there is little research on the coupling coordinated development of these two systems. Based on panel data of 31 Chinese provinces from 2001 to 2021, this study used the dynamic fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method to analyze the levels and driving paths of coupling coordinated development between agricultural CERS and food security. The results revealed that (1) the coupling coordination degree increased from 0.443 in 2001 to 0.489 in 2021, showing an upward trend. (2) We identified three driving paths of coupling coordination development: technology-driven, finance-driven and urban-development-driven. (3) The grain sown area and unit yield are core variables, serving as fundamental pillars, and their combination with technology or financial expenditure enhances this coordinated development. Notably, the grain sown area and unit yield exhibit a complementary relationship, while agricultural technology and financial expenditure demonstrate a substitution relationship. (4) Temporal analysis showed a consistent trend in the technology-driven and finance-driven paths. Regional analysis revealed marked heterogeneity: the technology-finance synergy path predominates in the remote west, the technology-driven path lies in the mountainous southwest, the finance-driven path clusters in the north, and the urban-development-driven path is located in economically advanced regions. Policymakers should formulate policies according to these different driving paths to promote coupling coordinated development. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Ecological and Environmental Risk Warning Framework of Land Use/Cover Change for the Belt and Road Initiative,"Land use/cover change(LUCC) has a significant impact on the ecological environment. Within the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as the largest cross-spatial cooperation initiative in human history, one of the core issues is how to scientifically and effectively use and manage the land in the region to prevent the destruction of important ecological and environmental resources. In order to reduce impact on the latter, in this study, we used the bivariate choropleth–multiple-criteria decision analysis (BC-MCDA) method based on the connotation of the sustainable development goals to construct an ecological and environmental risk warning framework. We found that in the study area, 10.51% of the land has high ecological and environmental risk and importance, corresponding to conflict zones, which require special attention. Conflict areas are mainly distributed in the Gangetic Plain in India, the plains in central and southern Cambodia, the Indonesian archipelago, and the southern coastal areas of China. Due to the uneven spatial distributions of population and important ecological and environmental resources, the pressure on this type of land use is very high. A share of 8.06% of the land has high risk–low importance, corresponding to economic development zones. Following years of human development, the ecological and environmental value of this type of land is low. A share of 58.75% of the land has low risk and importance, corresponding to wilderness areas. The natural climatic conditions of this type of land are relatively poor, often characterized by a cold climate or water scarcity, and the human interference index is low. A share of 22.68% of the land has low risk–high importance, corresponding to ecological conservation areas, which are the most important areas for ecological function services for humans at present.

To what extent did changes in temperature affect China's socioeconomic development from the Western Han Dynasty to the Five Dynasties period?,"Analysing the contribution of climate and non-climate change factors to social development and the occurrence of historical events represents important research on the impact of climate change. This study identifies combinations of social subsystem indices affected by temperature changes using the conceptual framework of food security, a priori knowledge and logical reasoning to statistically analyse three 10-year data series (grain harvest grades, famine indices and economic levels) from the Western Han Dynasty to the Five Dynasties period of ancient China (210 bc to 960 ad). The results are as follows. For 94 of the 118 decades in the study period, social development was relatively directly related to temperature effects. On a decadal scale, against a cold background, grain production was closely related to temperature conditions in 40.7% of all decades. Economic prosperity and depressions in 5.1 and 21.2% of these decades, respectively, were directly related to temperature effects. Against a warm background, grain production was closely related to temperature conditions in 39% of all decades. Economic prosperity and depressions in 22 and 8.5% of these decades, respectively, were directly related to the temperature effects. The century and decadal-scale characteristics were the same. Specifically, when mostly negative combinations of natural–socioeconomic factors dominated, the proportion of decades was slightly higher in cold than in warm periods. This case study enables a scientific understanding of the effect of changes in mean climate values/trends on social development and further demonstrates the different effects of the climate change process and mechanism. Climate cooling and warming may bring more positive than negative impacts in some regions and more negative than positive impacts in others. Complex feedback may amplify or reduce the impact of climate cooling and warming. Climate that evolves unfavourably has an impact more strongly correlated with the socioeconomic system's vulnerability and adaptability. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Global justice and the distribution of natural resources,"What should a political theorist say about the justice of the global distribution of natural resources? One issue is whether principles of distributive justice should be applied globally, and this has been debated between nationalists and cosmopolitans. A second, though, is how the category of 'natural resources' should be conceived in relation to other distributable goods. This has not adequately been addressed even by theorists of global justice who expressly focus on natural resources. In particular, neither Charles Beitz's argument for a natural resources redistribution principle nor David Miller's argument against works with a satisfactory account of how the physical distribution of resources relates to the distribution of their economic value. A more satisfactory account can be developed from the perspective of ecological economics as inspired by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen. From this perspective, global inequalities in the command of natural resources can be viewed with the clarity that a normative theory of their justice requires. If natural resources are re-conceptualised in terms of 'ecological space', Beitz's argument can be recast and vindicated. The re-conceptualisation is necessary to overcome the problems with the original version, as is shown by reference to the existing alternative formulations of Hillel Steiner and Thomas Pogge. © 2006 Political Studies Association.",Not About Sufficiency
"Tourism-related drivers of support for protection of fisheries resources on Andros Island, The Bahamas","Fisheries resources in the Caribbean suffer intense pressure from overharvesting. Some of the most valuable fisheries in The Bahamas, such as queen conch (Strombus gigas), spiny lobster (Panulirus argus), and Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), are overexploited and require additional protection. Despite these pressures, we currently know very little about the factors that underlie local residents' support for such protection. We interviewed residents of Andros Island, The Bahamas to evaluate how perception of environmental impacts of tourism, perception of benefits of tourism for their quality of life, income generation from tourism, and education level influenced their willingness to support additional protection of marine resources in the face of a growing tourism industry. We found that respondents supporting additional marine resource protection tended to perceive tourism as having negative impacts on marine resources and neutral to positive effects on their family's quality of life. Attending at least some college also positively influenced support for marine resource protection, although whether residents sold natural products to tourists did not appear to influence their stance on marine resource protection. Our results suggest education in a broad sense, and particularly education highlighting how tourism can both positively affect human well-being and harm marine resources, will promote public support for marine resource protection. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"A novel, integrated approach to assessing social, economic and environmental implications of changing rural land-use: A case study of perennial biomass crops","Concern about climate change and energy security is stimulating land-use change, which in turn precipitates social, economic and environmental responses. It is predicted that within 20 years in the UK, bioenergy crops could occupy significant areas of rural land. Among these, dedicated biomass crops, such as Miscanthus (Miscanthus spp.) grass and short rotation willow (Salix spp.) coppice, differ significantly from arable crops in their growth characteristics and management. It is important that the potential impacts of these differences are assessed before large-scale, long-term planting occurs. 2. We used a Sustainability Appraisal Framework (SAF) approach to landscape planning in the UK to identify stakeholder aspirations (objectives) and associated criteria (indicators) for the planting of dedicated biomass crops. 3. The use of environmental and physical constraints mapping allowed the SAF to focus only on environmentally-acceptable locations, thereby avoiding unsustainable trade-offs. The mapping identified 3·1 million ha of land in England as suitable for planting, suggesting the UK government target of 1·1 million ha by 2020 is feasible. 4. Evaluation of the SAF identified that while biodiversity was of concern to stakeholders, some current indicators of biodiversity are not appropriate. Butterfly abundance proved the most appropriate indicator, and it was found that total abundance was greater in field margins of both willow and Miscanthus biomass crops than in arable field margins. 5. Synthesis and applications. The potential conflicts of assuring food security, water availability, energy security and biodiversity conservation are recognized as a key challenge by governments worldwide. Methods with which decision-makers can compare the performance of different land-use scenarios against sustainability objectives will be crucial for achieving optimized and sustainable use of land-based resources to meet all four challenges. Using biomass crops planting as an example, this work illustrates the potential of a Sustainability Appraisal Framework, subject to identification and agreement of appropriate indicators, in securing a holistic understanding of the wide-ranging implications of large-scale, long-term changes to rural land-use in the wider context of sustainable land-use planning per se. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Not About Sufficiency
"Urbanization, livestock systems and food security in developing countries: A systematic review of the literature","This study systematically reviews the peer-reviewed literature on livestock production and food security in urbanizing environments of developing countries to synthesize the existing evidence and identify priorities for future research. Specifically, a systematic literature review was undertaken using PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases over the period 1980– 2017, resulting in a final number of 72 articles meeting our selection criteria. The results revealed a fragmentation in the literature, which draws from a very small number of studies, and is positioned in widely varied research areas, environments, livestock systems and consumption patterns. With such heterogeneity, drawing generalizations from the literature may be unreachable. Furthermore, the literature is largely qualitative in nature, with very few comprehensive models to capture and integrate empirical evidence. Food security was typically found to be narrowly defined, focusing primarily on interlinks with livestock supply. Considerably less attention has been given to other relevant dimensions of food security, such as accessibility, utilization and stability. Another important finding of relevance to food security is a need to address the “missing middle” in livestock value chains since the literature has customarily concentrated extensively on the two ends of the livestock value chain, i.e., on production and consumption, while widely ignoring other elements and actors along the value chain. A further focus on the interrelationships between livestock production, food security and urbanization in developing countries through a holistic and interdisciplinary approach is recommended. Particularly, future research aiming to understand livestock systems in the context of rapid urbanization should put more emphasis on addressing the full continuum of the livestock value chain and the four dimensions that drive food security in developing countries and how they possibly interrelate. © The Author(s) 2019.",Not About Sufficiency
Six critical questions about smart specialization,"During the last five years, we can observe a soaring academic interest in the concept of smart specialization. A burgeoning literature emerged both conceptually and empirically. In this paper, we pause for a while and take stock of six critiques so far identified in this emerging literature. The aim is to provide a critical lens for future research on smart specialization strategies and processes. We argue that: (1) Smart specialization is a confusing concept, as what it really means is diversification; (2) It is largely predicated on a conventional science and technology (S&T) model of innovation and regional economic development, whereas socio-ecological innovation and social innovation, have only been implicitly mentioned, at best; (3) It is the continuation of cluster policies, rather than a brand-new policy instrument; (4) It contains a delusional transformative hope, although the entrepreneurial discovery process could very likely lead to lock-ins; (5) Structurally weak regions might be less likely to benefit from smart specialization; and 6) more rigorous measurements of smart specialization are still needed. By engaging systematically with these six issues, we not only aim to improve the effects of smart specialization as a policy programme, but also to contribute to its conceptual advancement. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Using the Diverse Vegetables as a Filtration plants in Aquaculture Intensive System,"Changes to the physico-chemical conditions of treated water affect the biological traits of the aquatic organisms. There are water quality issues in rearing fish using a recirculating aquaculture system. Certain technologies for water treatment to improve its quality are highly energy intensive and expensive to use, thus implying high investment and operating costs. There is needed to look for novel method of water treatment which not only improves water quality and fish growth performance but is also cost effective and energy efficient to face climate change, lack of rain, and consequently fresh water scarcity, especially in the countries most affected in the Middle East. Any improvement by incorporating the mechanical and biological filter in one unit of an aquaponics intensive system is important in order to improve its efficiency and aquaculture yield. By incorporating a plant, namely: strawberry, peppermint, cucumber, and okra as a biological filtration to absorb the nutrient disintegrated additional to the green sponge layer and gravel as a mechanical filtration even for control treatment, aquaculture may become more sustainable in the future. After the acclimation interval, 24 tanks were stocked with 7 fish of an average initial weight of 15.74g. However, treatments were assigned to each container at random to make five treatments. First, this work evaluated the gravel fine mesh was used in the control treatment, strawberry, peppermint, cucumber, and okra, as a biofilter media in an aquaponics system. The results showed a significant effect on common carp average growth performance for cucumber and okra compared to the control treatment. However, a better growth performance for common carp culture in water-exposed cucumber and okra demonstrated significant improvement of FCR. Hence, improve in fish productivity in aquaponics system. There is a significant effect on cell counts and plasma enzyme and biochemistry conditions in strawberry, peppermint, cucumber, and okra biofilter medias. The liver cells and gills of the fishes grown in strawberry, peppermint, cucumber, and okra exhibited a normal sinusoid organisation with no indications of lesions or abnormalities of the hepatocytes. In briefly, the study elucidates the interests of using strawberry, peppermint, cucumber, and okra as a biofilter unit for aquaculture due to improved growth performance of common carp fish. © 2025, Tikrit University.

RECALIBRATING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION POLICY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: IMPLICATIONS FOR BIOSPHERE RESILIENCE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY TRANSITION,"As the world transits from primitive sources of energy generation to renewable and sustainable energy, the impact of climate change and biosphere resilience to this innovative transition cannot be over-emphasized. The study analysed the correlation between Climate Change Mitigation Policy (CCMP) and Environmental Performance (EP) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) using a linear regression statistical tool. The study leveraged integrative review and relied on secondary data. It found a positive correlation between CCMP and EP, indicating that focusing on climate change mitigation policies can enhance the SSA region's environmental performance (EP). The findings of this study posited that effective governance and strong institutional policies are crucial for implementing climate change mitigation policies, while, promoting sustainable development. The study concluded that implementing climate change mitigation policies effectively can positively affect the biosphere resilience, and drive the renewable energy transition in Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, the findings offer noteworthy lessons for policymakers and practitioners working to address the challenges of climate change, environmental degradation, and energy poverty in SSA. © 2024, Institute for Oil, Gas, Environment, Energy and Sustainable Development, Afe Babalola University.

Youth Resilience Toward Climate Smart Agriculture Technology Adoption in Brunei Darussalam,"Climate change and food security are critical issues to be addressed, nationally and globally, to reach sustainable agricultural development goals to feed the growing human population. The great challenge is to adapt to the climate change and in the meantime increase food production with sustainable farming practices that require farmers to have a paradigm shift toward climate smart agricultural technology (CSAT). Encouraging farmers to adopt and implement CSAT have become a priority for governmental policy making programmes. The question is what are the measures that can be taken for Brunei to leapfrog into this technology bandwagon to revitalise farmers for such transformation. In this study, we focussed on assessing the resilience of the youth farmers towards CSAT evolution. We proposed a platform on how to implement CSAT using an Integrated Technology Adoption (ITA) Framework and put forward seven approaches to embark our “hypotheses (H1eH7)”. A specific questionnaire was generated to achieve qualitative and quantitative data collection among 122 students attending the Agriculture School, Institute of Brunei Technical Education. Statistical analyses indicated that four hypotheses (H1, H4, H6 and H7) are well accepted, while the other three hypotheses (H2, H3, and H5) showed significant deviation from the expected test value, and they were simply rejected. The ITA Framework strongly advocates positive personality and attitude being the major driver towards adoption of CSAT with 88% responding positively on this determinant. The youth are motivated by the perceived benefits of CSAT despite their knowledge gaps in the CSAT applications. The data findings suggest that policymakers and expert panelists should focus on reviewing the qualitative governmental support strengthening awareness and training, in addition to traditional subsidies (quantitative support), which are readily accessible. In addition, both community support and Agrisupply-chain ecosystem need to be improved with an affordable finance scheme. © 2023 University of Brunei Darussalam.

Human biologic monitoring based on blood donations to the National Blood Services,"Background: The ambient exposure does not always reflect the internal levels of pollution absorbed in the body. While human biomonitoring (HBM) could provide a valid estimate of exposure extent, it is usually an expensive and a heavily manpowered enterprise. Using samples collected during blood donations for HMB may provide a more efficient platform for a routine biomonitoring. Methods: The current study is aimed to explore the feasibility of using the national blood banking system for the purposes of HBM, to compare between residents of a suspected polluted area in northern Israel (Haifa Bay) to the rest of the country. Specifically, we will assemble a geographically representative sample of blood donors residing in the study area and of the general population, to test for four industry and traffic-related metals: lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As) and chromium (Cr). Samples of whole blood from donors will be tested in the Laboratory of Public Health Services managed by the Ministry of Health. The information on donors' biomarkers levels will be further linked with the air pollution and meteorological data assessed at the location of the blood collection sites (short-term exposure) and donors' permanent address (long-term exposure), as recorded by the monitoring stations spread throughout Israel and the satellite-based exposure models. The association between biomarkers and ambient environmental exposures will be assessed. The samples' collection is planned for 2 years of 2020-2021. Discussion: The information collected in this study could lead to environmental regulations within Haifa Bay area aimed to prevent exposure to high levels of hazardous chemicals. © 2020 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Asymmetric nexus between urban agglomerations and environmental pollution in top ten urban agglomerated countries using quantile methods,"The rapid urbanization growth has not only improved the living standards of people but also raised concerns for environmental sustainability over the globe. In this regard, the issue of excessive urban concentration or over-agglomeration in metropolitan areas is nowadays the prime concern for urban planning and building energy-efficient and eco-friendly infrastructures. In response to rising interest in the dynamic linkage between urban concentration and environment, the current research empirically examines the crucial nexus between urban agglomerations and environmental degradation in top ten urban agglomerated countries in the world from 1960Q1 to 2014Q4. The current research is the pioneer empirical work in the area of urbanization by applying recently developed and innovative methods of quantile-on-quantile (QQ) approach and quantile Granger causality in relatively less explored area of urban agglomeration at the cross-country level. Our mainstream findings indicate that urban agglomeration has a strong positive effect on CO2 emissions in most of our sample countries, and this effect is more pronounced in higher quantiles of respective variables. These results imply that excessive levels of urban concentration in big cities cause environmental degradation, which could be attributed to extreme population density, overcrowding, traffic congestion and extensive demand for energy consumption. However, some countries such as Israel, Paraguay and Columbia exhibit overall declining and negative trends about the relationship between urban agglomerations and CO2 emissions. Moreover, quantile Granger causality results confirm the previous findings of QQ regression and verify the existence of bidirectional causal nexus between urban agglomerations and CO2 emissions in the majority of the lower, middle and upper quantiles in our selected top ten countries except for Kuwait. However, the unidirectional causal relationship also exists for several countries for extreme lower, middle and extremely higher quantiles. Our findings extend the previous work on agglomeration-environment nexus by determining the asymmetric magnitude of linkage between these two variables demanding cautious and individual-focused policies for urban planning and environmental sustainability. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatio-temporal assessment and climatology of atmospheric organic carbon over Pakistan,"Organic carbon (OC) is the amount of carbon found in an organic compound. Once entered, the environment OC may cause climate change and effects on public health. The objective of the study was to assess the spatio-temporal trends of OC, climatology, and to develop inventories. The three satellite datasets (MACCity, ACCMIP, RCP 8.5) showed significant different trends in OC levels. Results indicated significantly higher trends in OC distribution during anthropogenic activities and the industrial era as compared with natural sources and the pre-industrial era. The residential and industrial sectors showed higher emission of OC 1.0 × 10−5to 2.5 × 102 Tg/year, respectively as compared with other sectors. Spatial distribution of OC revealed higher levels in bigger cities (Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Multan, Punch, and Mardan districts) of Pakistan. The temporal analysis shows irregular increasing trends in OC distribution with the passage of time. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that residential OC showed a positive correlation with surface temperature, wind and heat and OC transport, sum, residential, and energy sector with relative humidity in MACCity and RCP 8.5 datasets, respectively. The study indicated that savanna burning and residential sectors were a major contributor to the level of OC. The results will be helpful for the government to devise policies regarding OC management. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.",Not About Sufficiency
"Quantifying the co-benefits of energy-efficiency policies: A case study of the cement industry in Shandong Province, China","In 2010, China's cement industry accounted for more than half of the world's total cement production. The cement industry is one of the most energy-intensive and highest carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting industries, and thus a key industrial contributor to air pollution in China. For example, it is the largest source of particulate matter (PM) emissions in China, accounting for 40% of industrial PM emissions and 27% of total national PM emissions. In this study, we quantify the co-benefits of PM10 and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission reductions that result from energy-saving measures in the cement industry in Shandong Province, China. We use a modified form of the cost of conserved energy (CCE) equation to incorporate the value of these co-benefits. The results show that more than 40% of the PM and SO2 emission reduction potential of the electricity-saving measures is cost effective even without taking into account the co-benefits for the electricity-saving measures. The results also show that including health benefits from PM10 and/or SO2 emission reductions reduces the CCE of the fuel-saving measures. Two measures that entail changing products (production of blended cement and limestone Portland cement) result in the largest reduction in CCE when co-benefits were included, since these measures can reduce both PM10 and SO2 emissions, whereas the other fuel-saving measures do not reduce PM10. © 2013.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrated approaches to estuarine use and protection: Tampa bay ecosystem services case study,"The Tampa Bay region faces projected stress from climate change, contaminants, nutrients, and of human development on a natural ecosystem that is valued (economically, aesthetically and culturally) in its present state. With fast-paced population increases, conversion and development of open land, and other stresses, redressing past damage to Bay habitats and protecting them in the future will remain the greatest challenge for managers in this region. Maintaining water quality gains of recent decades and sustaining ecological services requires careful thought and planning to compensate for these stressors. Approaches piloted during this study will be applicable to many urbanized estuaries, particularly along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coastline, because they face similar stresses. Regional and local planners, managers, and decision-makers, like those in the Tampa region, require new or modified ways to address questions regarding the production, delivery, and consumption of ecosystem services under various projected future scenarios of climate change and urban development. Approaches that we are developing collaboratively must address human well-being endpoints (the focus of ecosystem services) as well as more traditional measures of ecosystem integrity, sustainability, and productivity. Predictive estimates of ecosystem services value require 1) Alternative future scenarios, especially population growth and effects from climate change 2) Models translating environmental conditions set by these scenarios into ecosystem services production and their sustainability at different scales from local neighborhoods to watershed and larger and 3) An approach to visualize and link model outputs to a common currency for prioritization and valuation. Collectively, these comprise tools that can be used to make well-informed, thoughtful, and publically transparent decisions. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Imagining China: Rhetorics of nationalism in an age of globalization,"Standing as the world's two largest economies, marshaling the most imposing armies on earth, holding enormous stockpiles of nuclear weapons, consuming a majority share of the planet's natural resources, and serving as the media generators and health care providers for billions of consumers around the globe, the United States and China are positioned to influence notions of democracy, nationalism, citizenship, human rights, environmental priorities, and public health for the foreseeable future. These broad issues are addressed as questions about communication-about how our two nations envision each other and how our interlinked imaginaries create both opportunities and obstacles for greater understanding and strengthened relations. Accordingly, this book provides in-depth communication-based analyses of how U.S. and Chinese officials, scholars, and activists configure each other, portray the relations between the two nations, and depict their shared and competing interests. As a first step toward building a new understanding between one another, Imagining China tackles the complicated question of how Americans, Chinese, and their respective allies imagine themselves enmeshed in nations, old rivalries, and emerging partnerships, while simultaneously meditating on the powers and limits of nationalism in our age of globalization. © 2017 by Michigan State University.",Not About Sufficiency
Widening mismatch between UK seafood production and consumer demand: a 120-year perspective,"Developed countries are increasingly dependent on international trade to meet seafood requirements, which has important social, environmental, and economic implications. After becoming an independent coastal state following Brexit, the UK faces increased trade barriers and changes in seafood availability and cost. We compiled a long-term (120-year) dataset of UK seafood production (landings and aquaculture), imports, and exports, and assessed the influence of policy change and consumer preference on domestic production and consumption. In the early twentieth century, distant-water fisheries met an increasing demand for large, flaky fish such as cod and haddock that are more abundant in northerly waters. Accordingly, from 1900 to 1975, the UK fleet supplied almost 90% of these fish. However, policy changes in the mid-1970s such as the widespread establishment of Exclusive Economic Zones and the UK joining the European Union resulted in large declines in distant-water fisheries and a growing mismatch between seafood production versus consumption in the UK. While in 1975, UK landings and aquaculture accounted for 89% of seafood consumed by the British public, by 2019 this was only 40%. The combination of policy changes and staunch consumer preferences for non-local species has resulted in today’s situation, where the vast majority of seafood consumed in the UK is imported, and most seafood produced domestically is exported. There are also health considerations. The UK public currently consumes 31% less seafood than is recommended by government guidelines, and even if local species were more popular, total domestic production would still be 73% below recommended levels. In the face of climate change, global overfishing and potentially restrictive trade barriers, promoting locally sourced seafood and non-seafood alternatives would be prudent to help meet national food security demands, and health and environmental targets. © 2023, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Water of life.,"The Social Research Centre at the American University in Cairo, Egypt, trained 85 health promoters to teach women and children in the villages of Babil and Kafr Shanawan, Egypt, about households hygiene and water sanitation. Households instructed by health promoters had higher knowledge levels and practiced better behavior in areas of water storage, food preparation, latrine maintenance, and handwashing than those not receiving instruction. Researchers realized further improvement would not be possible without improving the village environment, so they also examined the water sanitation situation in the villages. In Babil, they noted that a standpipe needed to be repaired and a garbage collection system was needed. In Kafr Shanawan, the major problem was a high water table (1 m below the surface), but its other problems matched those of Babil. PVC handpumps were installed in Kafr Shanawan, resulting in increased access to potable water. Villagers wanted to learn how to maintain and repair the pumps. A women's group in Babil learned how to fix the standpipe. Administrative problems forestalled the garbage collection system after 3 months, however. The leading obstacles of improved sanitary conditions were a lack of communication between levels of government as well as between these levels and villages and unmanageable bureaucratic procedures. Villagers systematic doubt about the village of regional government agencies ever responding to villagers request for assistance resulted in apathy. Many villagers believed the government and not the villagers themselves was responsible for village sanitation, thereby becoming a major obstacle to community participation. Nevertheless, the villages did form committees on environmental issues. This health education model lays the groundwork for a partnership between decision makers, administrators, and villagers.",Not About Sufficiency
"Water scarcity, livelihoods and food security: Research and innovation for development","This volume reviews the evolution of ten years’ learning and discovery about water scarcity, livelihoods, and food security within the CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food. It draws on the experiences of over 100 projects conducted in ten river basins in the developing world. The book describes how the program’s design evolved from an emphasis on water scarcity, water productivity, and water access to an emphasis on using water innovations to improve livelihoods and address development challenges in specific river basins. It shows how the research was used to foster change in stakeholder behavior, linking it to improved knowledge, attitudes, and skills, which were fostered by stakeholder participation, innovation, dialogue, and negotiation. The authors describe development challenges, their drivers and their political context, how to address them through technical, institutional, and policy innovations; and the consequences of change at different scales, time frames on equity, resilience, and ecosystem services. Overall, the work represents a major synthesis and landmark publication for all concerned with water resource management and sustainable development. © 2014 International Water Management Institute.

Prison Ain't Free Like Everyone Thinks: Financial Stressors Faced by Incarcerated Women,"Most women in prison are poor and suffer from health problems prior to and during incarceration. Policies that impose inmate medical co-payment fees do not consider gender-specific health needs or other financial stressors faced by women in prison. We examine the financial needs and concerns of incarcerated women through the lens of gender and behavioral economics. We conducted individual interviews with 95 women incarcerated in a medium/maximum security prison in the United States. Women described several common financial stressors during confinement: paying for medical care, ""working for pennies,"" staying in contact with loved ones, and relying on others. In an attempt to remain gender neutral, prison polices often do not consider gender-based differences between male and female prisoners. When gender neutrality is applied to financial policies surrounding access to healthcare, incarcerated women are profoundly disadvantaged and left to make consequential trade-offs with scarce financial resources. Our findings provide important insight into financial stressors facing incarcerated women and provide evidence to support the elimination of mandatory medical co-payment fees for incarcerated women. © SAGE Publications.",Not About Sufficiency
A climate of risk: An environmental response,"The global climate is now thought to be warming as a consequence of human activity at approximately 0.3 °C per decade. This process could lead, within a few decades, to temperatures above those experienced in all of human history. Climatic warming is occurring in a global context of severe ecological stress. Unprecedented rates of species extinction are occurring and significant evidence exists of an instability in many natural systems. Poverty in the developing world is a major factor in the developing ecological crisis. In facing up to the problems posed by climatic change our policy formation processes are confronted by unprecedented challenges. Some of the key characteristics of the problem involve irreversibility, uncertainty, unpredictability and interactiveness. Conventional assumptions about the desirability and nature of economic growth may have to be reviewed. In view of the grave risks imposed by unrestrained climatic warming, it is argued that a strategy responding to the problem should favour measures designed to limit the rate of climatic warming, preferably below current levels, as well as taking the necessary adaptive measures. Energy and resource-use policies oriented towards conservation objectives could provide significant leverage on the global warming problem. The current rate of combustion of fossilfuels places approximately 5 Gt of carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide each year. Feasible fossil fuel consumption scenarios indicate that this carbon input could be reduced to 1-2 Gt y1 by the middle of the next century, whilst raising average global living standards. If fossil fuel consumption is unrestrained, carbon input to the atmosphere could accelerate to 20 Gty1 over the same time frame. Feasible options exist to control the emission of several of the major trace gases, notably chlorofluorocarbons, which are contributing significantly to the global warming. International action is necessary if a limitation strategy is to be successful. Moves analogous to the Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances could be contemplated to control the rate of release of greenhouse gases. Australia would need to develop an economic strategy that reduces dependence on energy intensive and resource intensive industries. In addition, a national review of the adequacy of the current system of biological reserves and their capacity to function under changing climatic circumstances is urgently needed. © CSIRO Australia, 1988.

Building resilience: Insights into ecosystem-based integrated environmental risk reduction approaches for urban environments in coastal Bangladesh,"The intricate relationship between environmental quality, ecosystem services, and human well-being underscores the importance of understanding and addressing environmental complexities. Considering these issues, this research aims to propose ecosystem-based approaches for mitigating environmental risks within the Khulna City Corporation (KCC) area, while also elucidating the connection between ecosystem services and these risks. By doing so, it indirectly addresses disaster risk reduction approaches, acknowledging the relationship between environmental degradation and increased disaster occurrences. Leveraging multi-spectral Landsat images from 2001 (Landsat-5), 2011 (Landsat-5), and 2021 (Landsat-8), the study evaluates LULC dynamics and quantifies ecosystem service values (ESVs) using the Benefit Transfer Method. Additionally, seven key indicators, including land use-based carbon emissions, elevation, LST, NDVI, NDWI, NDSI, and NDBI, were analyzed to monitor spatiotemporal changes. The weighted overlay method was employed to integrate raster data and delineate environmental risk zones driven by deteriorating ESVs in KCC. Notably, the study reveals a significant increase in highly environmental risk areas from 7 % to 34 % and a decrease in medium-risk areas from 92 % to 60 % of the total area between 2001 and 2021 due to the decline in ecosystem services resulting from unplanned rapid urbanization. Furthermore, a moderate negative correlation (R2 values of 0.56, 0.67, and 0.69) between ESVs and the environmental risk index underscores the linkage between deteriorating ecosystem services and the expansion of high-risk zones. Furthermore, this study advocates policies such as drought-resistant tree plantations, community involvement, post-disaster resource provision, funding allocation, and stakeholder knowledge dissemination to enhance the resilience of KCC. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Looking up and going down: Does sustainable adaptation to climate change ensure dietary diversity and food security among rural communities or vice versa?,"Sustainable food systems are essential to ensure food security and mitigate climate change. Adaptation to climate change is part and parcel of sustainable food systems. Prior literature merely documented the climate-smart agricultural practices and explored the relationship with food security of adopters without taking the period of the strategies into account. Therefore, this study explored the factors affecting sustainable adaptation to climate change and created a further link between sustainable adaptation to climate change and the food security of rural households. The cross-sectional data were collected from 384 farmers through a face-to-face survey in Pakistan, selected by a multistage random sampling method. An ordered probit model and propensity score matching technique were used to analyze the data. Education, farm size, credit access, extension services, internet use for agriculture information, women's participation in farm-related decision making, and considering climate change a significant problem for agriculture were all positively influencing the sustainable adaptation to climate change at farms. The results indicated that farmers with a higher level of sustainable adaptation to climate change consumed more diversified diets and more daily calories as compared to those with a lower level of sustainable adaptation. Similarly, farmers with a lower level of sustainable adaptation to climate change had significantly lower food security than farmers with a high level of sustainable adaptation at their farms. This research indicated that farmers can gain food and nutrition benefits by becoming more sustainable adapters to climate change. This study has important policy implications for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) of zero hunger (SDG 2) and climate action (SDG 13) in developing countries.

"Years of life lost attributable to air pollution, a health risk-based air quality index approach in Ningbo, China","Air pollution remains a significant threat to human health and economic development. Most previous studies have examined the health effects of individual pollutants, which often overlook the combined impacts of multiple pollutants. The traditional composite indicator air quality index (AQI) only focuses on the major pollutants, whereas the health risk-based air quality index (HAQI) could offer a more comprehensive evaluation of the health effects of various pollutants on populations. Currently, research on HAQI to evaluate the influence of multiple air pollutants on life expectancy losses is limited. In this study, we employed HAQIto estimate years of life lost (YLL) caused by exposure to air pollution for total deaths and sub-groups by sex, age, and cause-specific disease in Ningbo from 2014 to 2018. Results reveal that significant improvement in air quality during the study period. Based on the AQI-classified air quality risk category, the HAQI estimated a more severe level, which suggests that the commonly used AQI significantly underestimates the hazards of multiple air pollutants. The YLL attributable to exposure above threshold concentrations of the Chinese Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) 24-hour Grade II standards was 1.375 years (95% CI, 1.044–1.707) per death based on the HAQI, while the YLL estimated using AQI was 1.047 years (95% CI, 0.809–1.286) per death. Females and elderly people over 65 years were vulnerable subgroups, with YLL of 1.232 and 1.480 years per death, respectively. Among deaths of cause-specific disease, the YLL attributed to polluted air was highest for patients with respiratory diseases (0.866 years, 95% CI: 0.668–1.064), followed by patients with circulatory diseases (0.490 years) and endocrine diseases (0.478 years), respectively. Improving the standards of air quality could promote the management of air quality and reduce the disease burden and economic losses caused by polluted air to populations, especially for vulnerable populations. Our study provides a basis for the formulation of policies and upgrade of air quality standards. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Society of Biometeorology 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
From trade-offs to synergies in food security and biodiversity conservation,"Providing universal food security and conserving biodiversity are prominent challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Typically, these challenges are believed to involve a trade-off, especially in farming landscapes of the Global South. We conducted a multivariate analysis of social–ecological data from 110 landscapes in the Global South, and found that different system characteristics lead to partly predictable outcomes, resulting either in trade-offs or, unexpectedly, in synergies (mutual benefits) between food security and biodiversity. Specifically, these synergies are fostered by social equity, by reliable access to local land, and by increasing social capital (eg maintenance of traditions) and human capital (eg health). In contrast, we also found high degrees of food security in landscapes with adequate infrastructure, market access, and financial capital, but this increased security came at the expense of biodiversity. Our findings demonstrate that a social–ecological systems perspective can help to identify previously unrecognized synergies between food security and biodiversity conservation. © The Ecological Society of America",Not About Sufficiency
"Climate anxiety, economic policy uncertainty, and green growth","The convergence of climate change and economic instability has sparked an unprecedented surge in climate anxiety, emerging as a critical public health challenge of current era. Our study examines the relationship between economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and climate anxiety through both symmetric and asymmetric lenses, drawing on comprehensive panel data from G7 countries spanning 1999–2022. Through the development of a novel climate anxiety index and application of advanced panel techniques, we reveal robust evidence of EPU's substantial influence on climate anxiety. Our analysis demonstrates that this relationship intensifies at higher quantiles, while environmental performance metrics serve as crucial buffers against EPU's adverse mental health impacts. The bidirectional causality between EPU and climate anxiety emphasizes the urgent need for integrated economic and environmental policies to protect vulnerable populations' mental health in an increasingly uncertain world. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Geopolitics of mental health in Africa,"Global health and geopolitics are interacting areas but are not often seen as such. The global health movement appears to focus on using high-income country models on the Global South which may not be entirely applicable. In the post-cold war era, collaboration in health diplomacy and geopolitical forces in development must be seen as one of the pillars of international and bilateral foreign policy and the humanitarian agenda. Since the new millennia, the global powers and the low-and-middle income nations are engaging in several ambitious health and other developmental partnerships to address health, food security, and education. The Millennium Development Goals addressed physical health while the current Sustainable Development discourse concentrates on the wider dimensions of health including infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and injury. This includes mental health and substance use disorders as one of the non-communicable disease packages. Mental health is recently gaining momentum in the health and humanitarian issues globally. The CAPE Vulnerability Index brings a strong evidence-based approach to considering mental health in bilateral and international development aid.

Health Promotion in the Anthropocene,"The Ottawa Charter called for a socio-ecological approach in health promotion, but in practise we have until recently paid little attention to the ecological determinants of health. Yet if we understand public health as a branch of human and social ecology, what we might call “Health promotion 2.0” needs to integrate both social and ecological sustainability and justice in the context of the emerging field of planetary health. We need to help imagine and then create a future where governance is focussed not on unsustainable—and thus unattainable—growth in material prosperity, but on sustainable, equitable human development. Among other things, this calls for a new set of core values that will lead us to an economics for wellbeing. One key health promotion approach where these and related ideas can be implemented is the healthy cities and communities movement. What would our cities and communities be like if we had to live within the natural limits of the Earth, with an ecological footprint equivalent to one planet’s worth of bio-capacity and resources—while at the same time maintaining a high quality of life and good health for all? The good news is that there are reasons for hope here, because there are many health co-benefits to such a way of life, which health promoters should identify and pursue. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
IMPACT OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS ON ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,"The rise in extreme weather conditions poses a formidable menace to the ecosystem services (ES) bestowed by ecosystems upon humanity. A precise comprehension of the ramifications of extreme weather events on ES is imperative to establish a robust scientific foundation for mitigating the adverse consequences of such phenomena. Despite the extensive corpus of international studies on the impact of extreme weather events on ES, there is a lack of literature reviews and nuanced discussions regarding forthcoming research aims. Therefore, this paper selects to focus on drought, extreme precipitation, heatwaves, and extreme cold—representatives of extreme weather with substantial global ramifications and notable threats. It summarizes the effects of extreme weather events with substantial global on ES, identifies current research issues, and outlines future prospects. Research indicates that the impact of extreme weather events on ES is predominantly negative. Extreme weather affects ecological processes and human needs, subsequently influencing the supply-demand relationship and trade-offs between ES. The diversity of research methods is influenced by differences in research objectives and scales. The interaction of various extreme weather events and the complex coupling with human activities make the mechanisms of extreme weather events impact on ES more intricate. A deficiency exists in the systematic exploration of the dynamic characterization of supply-demand relationships and trade-off dynamics under the sway of extreme weather. Additionally, there is a paucity of research addressing the recovery processes and underlying mechanisms governing ecosystem services (ES) in the aftermath of extreme weather events. Additionally, there is a need for in-depth attention to the spatial scale characteristics of ES under the influence of extreme weather, which is crucial for understanding the mechanism of impacts. © 2024, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.",Not About Sufficiency

We thus examine the magnitude of air quality in the particular month by applying the air quality index (AQI), which is based on the newly upgraded Chinese environmental standard. Our finding revealed that (1) air quality has distinct spatial heterogeneity and relatively better air quality was observed in the northwest while worse quality happened in the southeast part of the city; (2) the wind speed is the main determinant of air quality in the city—when wind speed is greater than 4 m/sec, air quality can be significantly improved; and (3) urban impervious surface makes a contribution to the severity of air pollution—that is, with an increase in the fraction of impervious surface in a given area, air pollution is more severe. The results from our study demonstrated the severe pollution in Beijing and its meteorological and landscape factors. Also, the results of this work suggest that very strict air quality management should be conducted when wind speed less than 4 m/sec, especially at places with a large fraction of urban impervious surface. © 2015 A&WMA.",Not About Sufficiency

"Impacts of climate change and black sand on Red Sea, Egypt. A comprehensive review","Global climate change, resulting from natural processes, external forces, and human activities, poses a significant threat to human well-being and development. Rising sea levels and temperatures are making various regions increasingly uninhabitable, with marine ecosystems facing substantial risks, particularly from coral bleaching events. The Red Sea a young oceanic zone formed by the divergence of the Arabian and African tectonic plates, spans approximately 2250 km in length and 355 km in width, reaching depths of up to 2200 m. This region is characterized by arid landscapes and mountainous terrain. One of the significant concerns for the Red Sea is the presence of black sand along its coast in Egypt. This sand is rich in dark-colored minerals such as magnetite, ilmenite, and hematite, whose composition includes silica, iron oxide, and titanium oxide. Techniques like X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) have been utilized to analyze its composition. The albedo effect of black sand, characterized by its low ability to reflect solar radiation, contributes to higher heat absorption and localized warming. This warming influences the Red Sea surface temperatures, which are affected by factors such as air-sea interactions and dust storms. The environmental implications of black sand mining are profound, with risks including habitat destruction and pollution. These activities emphasize the need for comprehensive studies and sustainable management practices in the Red Sea region. Addressing the environmental impacts associated with black sand mining is crucial for conserving the Red Sea ecosystem. Furthermore, international collaboration and sustainable practices are vital in protecting the Red Sea ecosystem from the adverse effects of climate change. By understanding the interplay between climate change and human activities, such as black sand mining, and implementing effective conservation strategies, we can work towards mitigating the negative impacts on this unique and vital marine environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Botswana stock exchange listed companies and sustainable water demand management,"The rise in world population growth and its attendant rise in demand for food and living standards in addition to climate change scenarios continue to warrant the need for sustainable management of natural resources. The paper, therefore, analysed climate change actions and water demand management approaches employed by Botswana Stock Exchange (BSE) listed companies to manage water resources. Fourteen of the twenty-four domestic companies were reviewed using self-completed, open ended questionnaires and secondary data. Thematic Analysis method of qualitative research was employed to analyse the textual data. The results revealed that water demand management (WDM) practices and strategies among companies ranged from, rainwater harvesting, water reclamation and reuse, water efficient fixtures and appliances, awareness/knowledge creation strategies and risk management. The unearthed information on private companies’ holistic water use strategies could facilitate environmental sustainability and operational economic gains. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The Great Man-Made River Project in Libya: An Overview of the Current Status and Future Prospects,"The Great Man-Made River Project (GMMRP) was implemented to address Libya’s water scarcity problem by utilizing groundwater instead of desalination due to cost, capacity expansion, and operational considerations. The GMMRP aimed to produce and transport 6.4 million cubic meters of groundwater daily to meet the water demands of northern Libyan urban settlements for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use. The GMMRP has achieved its objectives of improving the quality of life for residents, alleviating pressure on coastal aquifers, and promoting sustainable development, without any adverse environmental impacts. However, the GMMRP has faced significant challenges following the 2011 Libyan civil war. These include a decline in financial resources due to political conflicts, lower oil production and prices, and direct and indirect economic losses from damage caused by armed conflict and lack of security. Additionally, the GMMRP faces a considerable discrepancy between the cost of water production and the price charged to consumers, insufficient revenue generation, and an inability to import critical spare parts and materials for maintenance operations. Other challenges include unclear criteria for water allocation, incomplete information to estimate the costs of development investment plans, frequent electricity supply interruptions, and infrastructure issues. Furthermore, to ensure the project’s sustainability, its recommended to develop a sustainable financial plan, improve billing and collection processes, priorities infrastructure maintenance, and develop effective monitoring and inspection systems. Also, it suggested creating a comprehensive national strategy for managing water resources and prioritizing water supplies for urban, industrial, and agricultural uses. The integration of planning for irrigation water management, investing in treated wastewater, and transparently allocating water among users based on economic, technical, social, and environmental standards are also recommended. Additionally, strengthening security measures, implementing effective pollution control measures, and promoting water-saving technologies and practices. Overall, the GMMRP has been successful in providing a solution to Libya’s water scarcity problem. Still, there is a need for concerted efforts to address the challenges it faces to ensure its sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Trees on farms improve dietary quality in rural Malawi,"Trees on farms not only provide agricultural and environmental benefits but can also contribute to food security. We use panel data covering a 10-year period from the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) to examine the effects of trees on farms on people's dietary quality in rural Malawi. We found that having on-farm trees leads to higher and more diverse fruit and vegetable consumption. Specifically, households who had trees on their farm (or who acquired trees during the 10-year period) exhibited a 3% increase in vegetable consumption compared to households without trees. Moreover, for every additional tree species owned or acquired by a household during the study period, fruit consumption increased by 5%. These results demonstrate that trees on farms may play a role in meeting nutrition, conservation, and climate change mitigation goals, with important implications for sustainable development strategies in low- and middle-income countries. © 2025 The Author(s).

Genetic improvement of Aceh local rice variety Sikuneng to produce green super rice lines adaptive to abiotic stresses,"The high genetic diversity of rice landraces of Aceh has great potential to contribute to the world's food security program in the future, especially in adapting to climate changes and environmental degradation. The objective of this research was to develop a new superior rice line adaptive to abiotic stress and maintains high productivity despite limited agricultural inputs. An Aceh's local variety, Sikuneng, was artificially crossed with an isogenic line IRBB27 and the F1 plants were self-pollinated for two generations. The F3 lines were cultivated in drought stress and high salinity conditions with the application of aerobic rice system and flash irrigation. It was discovered that the F3 lines showed significantly improved plant height, number of panicles per plant, panicle length, grain weight per plant and grain yield potential per hectare. The plant height of the F3 lines varied from 98 to 192 cm, whereas the plant height of Sikuneng was 172 cm. The number of panicles of F3 lines ranged from 10.3 to 43.5, whereas Sikuneng had only 8.7 panicles. The panicle length of F3 lines ranged from 23.9 to 47.3 cm and Sikuneng had only 28.1 cm of panicle length. The grain weight per plant of F3 lines varied from 69.8 to 196.7 g, in contrast to the grain weight of Sikuneng which was 64.5 g. The weight of 1,000 grains of F3 lines ranged from 21.0 to 34.9 g, whereas that of Sikuneng was 26.9 g. While the yield potential of Sikuneng was 7.6 t/ha, the yield potential of the F3 lines varied from 7.2 to 13.9 t/ha. The highest yield potential was shown by Skn-68-1 line. Further evaluation and selection process need to be conducted in the next generations until the improved characters of the new lines are stable. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

The role of agrobiodiversity and diverse causes of its losses and methods of conservation: A review,"Agrobiodiversity implies the diversity of living forms in agricultural systems and is critical for food security, ecosystem health, and resilience to climate change. It includes a wide range of crops, livestock, and microorganisms that help to increase nutritional diversity while also improving ecosystem functions like pollination and soil fertility. However, agrobiodiversity is under threat from industrial agriculture, urbanization, climate change, pesticide use, globalization, and the loss of traditional knowledge. Therefore, this review article emphasizes the importance of agrobiodiversity in sustainable agriculture and the urgent need for integrated measures to combat its loss. To achieve this objective, different reputable journal articles that were published in the past 11 years and scope were collected, screened, and compiled systematically. Most of the reviewed articles stated that agrobiodiversity contains all the components of biological diversity that are relevant to agricultural ecosystems. It has an essential role in the sustainable development of agricultural systems, which provide food, fiber, fuel, fodder, medicines, and other products for subsistence. Monoculture techniques and land conversion reduce genetic variety, while market dynamics favor a small number of high-yield varieties, further marginalizing local crops. By fostering sustainable practices, maintaining genetic diversity, and supporting traditional agricultural knowledge, we can assure the future of agrobiodiversity and ensure resilient food systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Extreme weather events and Spatio-temporal characterization of climate change variables in Bangladesh during 1975–2019,"Bangladesh is susceptible to climate change, thus a detailed study, including the analyses of trends, sub-trends, extreme events and indices was conducted to obtain a complete picture of the climate change pattern in Bangladesh utilizing daily rainfall, maximum, minimum and average temperature data of 26 stations from 1975 to 2019 using R 4.0.2 software. For the trend analysis Mann Kendal (MK), modified Mann Kendall (mMK), Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) and Sen's slope methods were used. Sub-trend analysis was conducted using ITA. Standard Anomaly Index (SAI) has been used to identify the frequency and severity of extreme events. ClimPACT2 software was used to check the homogeneity and calculate the extremes of temperature and rainfall data. Our analysis showed that during the last four decades, climate variables changed their patterns and trend heterogeneously over Bangladesh. Most stations showed decremental rainfall trend when central part of the country showed a substantial decrease. The northern and central parts of the country showed significant growth of trend for annual average temperature. The temperature in the monsoon season increased, whereas those in dry season decreased. The rainfall and maximum temperature were inversely related during monsoon whereas during dry season both of them decrease. The pre-monsoon and post-monsoonal rainfall also showed decreasing trends, indicating prevailing drought conditions especially in northern and central parts of the country. The SAI analysis showed alternating drought and wet years in almost all the stations. In the past 20 years, the country's western region experienced more drought years than before whereas the coastal region experienced more wet years. The analysis of climate extreme indices suggests that, Consecutive Dry Days (CDD), Hot Days (TX90P) and Hot Nights (TN90P) show significant increasing trend throughout the country. The agricultural productivity, water resource management and food security are anticipated to benefit from this study. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Understanding the socioeconomic determinants of cooking fuel expenditure in Uttar Pradesh, India","Poor people in a developing country like India face energy poverty and are deprived of clean cooking fuel. Clean cooking fuels are costlier and require more willingness to pay (WTP) from the consumer. Therefore, this is a descriptive study aims to analyze factors associated with differences in cooking fuel expenses at the household level in Uttar Pradesh, India. For this purpose, panel data from the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey of CMIE from 2014 to 2019 has been considered. The study uses fixed-effect panel data model to control individual-specific effects. Cooking fuel expenses show positive elasticity concerning per capita income. However, this elasticity is lower for the higher-income group than the bottom-income group. Less educational attainments of households are associated with lower spending on cooking fuel. Moreover, households with better access to electricity are willing to spend more on cooking fuel expenditure. Hence, improved access to electricity nudges households towards more WTP for cooking fuel. It is further confirmed by finding a positive association between electricity-using household appliances and cooking fuel expenses. Therefore, improved access to electricity may increase the WTP for cooking fuel and adopt clean cooking fuel in different ways. This suggests positive spillover effects of modern energy services on clean cooking fuel. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Combined effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on soybean yield, oil quality, and biochemical responses under drought stress","The increasing frequency and intensity of drought stress, exacerbated by climate change, pose significant threats to agricultural productivity and food security. In this context, this study investigates the effects of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO[sbnd]NPs) and Myco-Root-a proprietary blend of three distinct mycorrhizal fungal species-on the yield and oil quality of soybean (Glycine max) under drought stress. By exploring innovative strategies, this research aims to enhance agricultural resilience and promote sustainable food production in challenging environmental conditions. Utilizing a randomized complete block design over two years (2021–2022), the experiment included 12 treatments with three levels of drought stress (optimal irrigation (MAD20), moderate water deficit (MAD50), and severe water deficit (MAD80)) and four fertilizer management strategies (control, ZnO[sbnd]NPs (200 mg L⁻¹), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and a combination of both). The results showed that drought stress reduced colonization, whereas the combined application of ZnO[sbnd]NPs+AMF enhanced colonization by 10 % relative to AMF alone. Additionally, under MAD20 conditions, the combined treatment of ZnO[sbnd]NPs+AMF significantly increased nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and zinc uptake by 82.61 %, 100.49 %, 94.78 %, and 143.11 %, respectively, compared to severe drought stress conditions without fertilization. This treatment also increased proline and soluble carbohydrates under severe drought conditions by 77.29 % and 58.75 %, respectively, compared to the control. Furthermore, the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, and catalase increased by 85.92 %, 111.18 %, and 80.13 respectively, reducing oxidative stress markers such as malondialdehyde (51.27 %) and hydrogen peroxide (63.44 %) compared to untreated conditions. In terms of both oil quantity and quality, the combined treatment of ZnO[sbnd]NPs+AMF under MAD20 conditions increased linoleic and linolenic acid concentrations by 60.75 % and 43.91 %, respectively, while decreasing palmitic and stearic acid concentrations by 50.45 % and 24.88 %, respectively. These changes resulted in a 145.47 % increase in seed yield and an 24.32 % increase in oil content compared to MAD80 conditions without treatment. Additionally, when compared to severe drought stress without fertilization, the application of ZnO[sbnd]NPs+AMF under MAD20 enhanced the iodine value by 9.7 %, while the saponification number under MAD80 without fertilization increased by 3.2 % relative to the control. Furthermore, the combined application of ZnO[sbnd]NPs+AMF under optimal irrigation conditions resulted in an 41.04 % reduction in the acid value compared to drought stress without fertilizer application. Overall, these findings suggest that the combined use of ZnO[sbnd]NPs and AMF can serve as an effective strategy to improve crop performance and oil quality under drought stress conditions. This approach enhances plant resilience to climate change, improves agricultural productivity, promotes food security, and supports the sustainability of agricultural systems. © 2025 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Mathematical Programming Models to Increase Land and Water Use Efficiency in Semi-arid NE-Brazil,"Construction of the Itaparica dam and reservoir induced changes in the agricultural production systems of the Itaparica micro-region, at the lower-middle São Francisco river basin. Extensive traditional systems were replaced by e.g. irrigated fruit production. However, over twenty years after the dam construction, many farmers are still facing income insecurity. A survey, consisting of expert interviews and structured on-farm interviews, has been conducted to analyze current production systems. A Linear Programming farm optimization model was applied to determine optimal land allocation considering changing production conditions. Income depended strongly on low wages for day laborers, free irrigation water, and stable prices of the main crop, coconut. Diversification of production and improved market access can help to improve farmers’ income situation. Moderate water pricing can raise the awareness of water scarcity and lead to implementation of water saving production methods. © 2014. All Rights Reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimizing Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Irrigation to Introduce the Optimum Genotype for Grain Yield and Quality Promotion,"Utilizing new irrigation techniques to introduce cultivars into paddy fields experiencing water scarcity is one way to combat water shortage and increase water productivity. To this end, this experiment was conducted as a strip plot in a randomized complete block design with three independent replications over two years (2016 and 2017) at the Rice Research Institute of Iran, Amol, Iran. Ten rice genotypes (V1 to V10) were subjected to three types of irrigation systems, including conventional Flood Irrigation (FI) and Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) at 10 (AWD10) and 20 (AWD20) cm below the soil surface. These results demonstrate that AWD10 and AWD20 methods reduced water consumption by 20 and 17%, respectively, compared to the conventional methods. This decreased water usage resulted in 1.4 and 0.2% yield losses compared to the conventional flood irrigation system. Moreover, milling recovery in flood irrigation (68.7%) was lower than AWD10 and AWD20 methods (69.6 and 69.8%, respectively). In conclusion, Neda, Shiroodi, and 8611 rice genotypes showed a better response to AWD irrigation, and may be considered as suitable genotypes for increasing water productivity in paddy fields. © 2024, Tarbiat Modares University.

"Nature, power, and growth","This essay reviews the relationship between natural-resource abundance and economic growth around the world, and presents some new results. The principal reasons why resource-based production can inhibit economic growth over long periods are traced to the Dutch disease, neglect of education, rent seeking, and economic policy failures. Across a large number of countries in the period from 1965 to 1998, the share of the primary sector in the labour force is shown to be inversely related to exports, domestic and foreign investment, and education, and directly related to external debt, import protection, corruption, and income inequality. The cross-sectional data show, moreover, that the share of the primary sector in the labour force is inversely related to per capita growth across countries. None of this lies in the nature of things, however. What seems to matter for economic growth is not the abundance of natural resources per se, but rather the quality of their management, and of economic management and institutions in general.",Not About Sufficiency
Guyana.,"The population characteristics, geography, history, government, economy, political situation, and foreign relations of Guyana are briefly described. In 1984 population size was estimated at 775,000, and the annual population growth rate was 0.7%. Ethnically the population is 51% East Indian, 43% African and mixed African, 4% Amerindian, 4% European, and 2% Chinese. 57% of the population is Christian, 33% Hindu, and 9% Muslim. Schooling is compulsory for those aged 5-16 years, and the literacy rate is 86%. Life expectancy is 70 years, and the infant mortality rate is 41. The country is divided geographically into a coastal region, where 90% of the population lives; a strip of grass-covered savanna running to the south of the coastal region; and an interior, sparsely populated, forested region, which contains 85% of the the land surface of the country. In the late 1500s the Dutch settled in Guyana, and in 1796 the British became the de facto rulers of Guyana. Amerindians and then later African slaves were exploited as laborers during the colonial era. Still later, indentured workers were brought in from India, Portugal, and China. Guyana became an independent country in 1966 and a republc in 1970. Since 1964 the country has been ruled by Forbes Burnham, 1st as prime minister, and then after the adoption of a new constitution in 1980, as executive president. The government consits of a unicameral National Assembly, an executive president representing the major party in the assembly, a cabinet, and a judicary branch. Forbes is a member of the People's National Congress, which is the dominant party in the country. The party is supported primarily by urban blacks, and the goal of the party is to make Guyana into a nonaligned socialist country. The major opposition party is the People's Progressive Party, which favors the establishment of a Moscow oriented communist country and is supported primarily by the East Indian population. Currently, public sector enterprises dominate the economic system, and 51% of the population is employed in the public sector; however, there are also cooperative and private sector enterprises. 33.8% of the work force is engaged in agriculture, 44.5% in industry and commerce, and 21.7% in services. The gross national product (GNP) was US$419 million (1983), the annual economic growth rate was 10.1% (1982-3), and per capita income was US$457 (1983). Agriculture accounts for 26% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and major agricultural products are sugar and rice. Sugar processing and marketing is handled by a government owned company. Industry, primarily the mining and processing of bauxite and aluminum, accounts for 27% of the GDP. In 1983 exports totated US$193.3 million, and exports amounted US$243 million. During the last several years, the economic situation deterioritated. Productivity is declining, equipment and facilities are outdated, and many skilled workers are emigrating. A number of economic reforms were adopted, but recovery depends on the ability of the government to reach a standby facility agreement with teh International Monetary Fund. Guyana maintains ties with both communist and capitalists countries and is engaged in a major territorial dispute with Venezuela. Since 1966, the US provided Guyana with US$415 million in unilateral and bilateral aid.",Not About Sufficiency
Challenges and opportunities associated with the role of forestry in promoting water-energy and food security nexus in Ethiopia,"This paper discusses the extent to which decentralised and participatory forest resources management contributes to promoting synergies and reducing trade-offs in the water-energy and food security nexus in Ethiopia. After having briefly highlighted the historical and institutional context of forest management policy in the country, we provide an articulated and holistic nexus framework that takes into account the complementarity and interconnectedness that emerge from simultaneous natural resources uses. Moreover, the proposed framework takes into account the competing interests that exist between forest and other natural resources such as water, energy and land use for agriculture. Forest policy is therefore elaborated in a broader context where there are synergies and trade-offs associated with natural resource management. This paper finally outlines the institutional settings and governance structures that support a nexus management approach, which provides policy innovations that are required to achieve optimal economic and non-economic values of forest and alternative natural resources uses.

Seven food system metrics of sustainable nutrition security,"Sustainability considerations have been absent from most food security assessments conducted to date, despite the tremendous economic, environmental, and social implications of meeting accelerating food demand in the face of water shortages and climate change. In addition, previous food security work has generally focused only on achieving adequate calories, rather than addressing dietary diversity and micronutrient adequacy, both of which are critical to maintaining a healthy overall nutritional status. In response to the limitations of previous assessments, a new methodology is proposed here based on the concept of ""sustainable nutrition security"" (SNS). This novel assessment methodology is intended to remedy both kinds of deficiencies in the previous work by defining seven metrics, each based on a combination of multiple indicators, for use in characterizing sustainable nutrition outcomes of food systems: (1) food nutrient adequacy; (2) ecosystem stability; (3) food affordability and availability; (4) sociocultural wellbeing; (5) food safety; (6) resilience; and (7) waste and loss reduction. Each of the metrics comprises multiple indicators that are combined to derive an overall score (0-100). A novel SNS assessment methodology based on these metrics can be deployed by decision-makers and investors to set meaningful goals, track progress, and evaluate the potential impact of food system interventions intended to improve sustainability and human nutrition outcomes. © 2016 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The new great transformation: from migration crisis to sustainable welfare,"The increase in extreme weather phenomena, environmental pollution, and climate change poses a new major challenge to not only fragile and conflict-affected states but also European capitalist societies facing new migratory flows. In this context, migratory phenomena represent a symptom of the great changes taking place and an opportunity to rethink our life systems. They also pose new challenges to European redistributive mechanisms and new social demands, desires, and expectations to fulfill. To this end, it is necessary to understand the determinants, characteristics, and magnitude of this phenomenon and imagine new strategies for integration. While sustainable development seems to represent the only available driver for producing a new great paradigmatic transformation to cope with environmental degradation, poverty, famine, inequalities, etc., we wonder what constitutes the sustainability of welfare, which is increasingly being discussed today. To answer these questions, the researchers conducted an extensive secondary analysis of the migration data present in the Eurostat database and those of key European institutions. Subsequently, they extensively surveyed the literature to reconstruct the state-of-the-art on sustainable welfare. © 2023 University of Rome ‘La Sapienza’.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the nexus of freshwater resources and international conflict:bibliometric insights and a research agenda for the future,"Accessing and controlling freshwater resources holds immense significance in ensuring human survival, preserving ecosystems, and fostering economic growth. The confluence of water scarcity and heightened demand has precipitated disputes that have further exacerbated global conflicts. Despite the growing research efforts in this area, a comprehensive literature review on freshwater resource and international conflict is lacking. This study employs a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to examine the interplay between scientific research on freshwater resources and international conflicts. A two-tier approach is adopted, analysing 779 papers from the Scopus database. In the first tier, advanced bibliometric techniques are utilised to track the evolution and current state of the literature, identifying specific research clusters. The second tier involves a detailed content analysis of these clusters, providing insights for future research directions.

Global governance of ecosystem services and related policy instruments,"Humans live off the bounty of the earth. In order to be able to sustainably enjoy these resources, humans need to organize their relationship with the earth. This organization is in terms of governing the use and abuse of the earth’s resources. The Global Environmental Outlook (UNEP, 2012) published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) argues that growing economies and populations within the context of complex globalization are leading to unprecedented pressures on the environment and ecosystem services. This calls for strong and effective governance! There is nothing new about environmental governance and the study of environmental governance. For example, the history of water governance can be traced back some thousands of years (Dellapenna and Gupta, 2009). However, it would be fair to say that environmental governance came into its own in the twentieth century and that the study of environmental law, politics, policy, and economics has been on the agenda for at least the last 60 years. Numerous books and articles discuss environmental governance from the local to the global level. Such books include Carson’s (1962) Silent Spring, Falk’s (1971) This Endangered Planet, Ward and Dubos’ (1972) Only One Earth, Meadows et al.’s (1972) The Limits to Growth, and many others.

Negotiating challenges and climate change,"The difficulties in negotiating a post-2012 regime of binding targets and timetables and the decisions of the US, Canada, and Russia on the Kyoto Protocol regime have led to pessimism about the future of the climate regime. Negotiation issues for different coalitions and actors are placed in a wider historical context by examining the key challenge facing the evolving long-term climate change negotiation process: the principled basis for the allocation of resources, responsibilities, rights, and risks between actors. Four theoretical approaches (problem structuring; negotiation theory; collective action and social practice models; legal theory) are applied to the climate regime. A principled approach is only a distributive approach from a narrow short-term perspective. It becomes an integrative approach from a longer-term perspective when it increases the pie, enhances the win-win opportunities and creates space for sustainable solutions to emerge. It is especially integrative when undertaken within the context of global rule of law, which is able to create predictable rules that apply to future global problems with different country interests.

Linking reservoir ecosystems research to the sustainable development goals,"Reservoirs account for about 10% of the freshwater stored in lakes worldwide. These reservoirs are home to ‘reservoir ecosystems’, that is, the aquatic and non-aquatic interactive ecosystems associated with artificial lakes where water is stored, typically behind a dam, for human purposes. While reservoir ecosystems provide various ecosystem services for sustainable development, their significance in research and policy has not been well understood and not well defined in the 2030 United Nation's (UN) Agenda for Sustainable Development. To advance understanding of reservoir ecosystems and their impact on policy, here we provide an overview of research on reservoir ecosystems and link it to UN SDGs and their Targets. Based on 5280 articles published in the last three decades, we applied network visualization to construct a framework for research addressing reservoir ecosystems. The framework covers four major themes: (1) ecosystem structure and function, (2) environmental pollution and stress effects, (3) climate impacts and ecological feedbacks, and (4) ecosystem services and management. We have found that sustainable reservoir ecosystems synergistically support 121 Targets of UN SDGs (71% of all). Reservoir ecosystems have both negative and positive implications for 15 targets (9%) and negative trade-offs for only 3 targets (2%). Thirty SDG Targets (18%) are unrelated to sustainable reservoir ecosystems. The synergies and trade-offs exist in three fields, securing basic material needs (SDGs 2, 6, 7, 14 and 15), pursuing common human well-being (SDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10), and coordinating sustainable governance policies (SDGs 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17). Exploring these linkages allows better integration of reservoir ecosystems into the UN SDGs framework and guides sustainable management of reservoir ecosystems for sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

"Energy security for India: Biofuels, energy efficiency and food productivity","The emergence of biofuel as a renewable energy source offers opportunities for significant climate change mitigation and greater energy independence to many countries. At the same time, biofuel represents the possibility of substitution between energy and food. For developing countries like India, which imports over 75% of its crude oil, fossil fuels pose two risks-global warming pollution and long-term risk that oil prices will undermine real living standards. This paper examines India's options for managing energy price risk in three ways: biofuel development, energy efficiency promotion, and food productivity improvements. Our salient results suggest that biodiesel shows promise as a transport fuel substitute that can be produced in ways that fully utilize marginal agricultural resources and hence promote rural livelihoods. First-generation bioethanol, by contrast, appears to have a limited ability to offset the impacts of oil price hikes. Combining the biodiesel expansion policy with energy efficiency improvements and food productivity increases proved to be a more effective strategy to enhance both energy and food security, help mitigate climate change, and cushion the economy against oil price shocks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Governmental approaches to food security management: A bibliometric analysis,"The government's duty is to guarantee unimpeded access to food. Thus, relevant public policies, individual methods and tools, approaches, and strategic decisions are always the focus of attention of scientists, politicians, and government officials. Recognizing the critical importance of this imperative, this study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis that sheds light on the scientific landscape of strategic public administration of food security. The paper conducts a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications (using VosViewer - from 1990 to February 2024 using Scopus and WoS scientometric databases); monographs/textbooks (using Google Books and Ngram Viewer - for 1990-2019); and trend analysis (using Google Trends - from 2004 to February 2024). The analysis showed an exponential increase in the number of publications since 2000, with peaks in 2008 (financial crisis), 2019-2020 (COVID-19), and 2023 (threat to food security due to military conflicts). The clustering of scientific papers by content showed that the most significant (red) cluster unites research that links food security to agricultural development, sustainable development, climate change, and water supply. The spatial clustering of scientific publications revealed that scientific leadership belongs to scientists from the United States and China. The largest research funders are Chinese scientific institutions. It also reflected regional differences in research focus. In particular, Italy, Switzerland, and France emphasize agricultural innovation and quality standards, while China and Australia focus on increasing yields and food storage technologies. © Eldar Guliyev, Bayali Atashov, Aygun Guliyeva, 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Determinants of ecological footprint in European countries: Fresh insight from Bayesian model averaging for panel data analysis,"This study examines the determinants of the ecological footprint of production in European countries from 1992 to 2020. Using partial and semipartial correlation analyses and Bayesian Modeling Averaging (BMA) approach for the first time, the research identifies key variables affecting ecological footprint. Using Bayesian methods, posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) were calculated for each variable's coefficient estimates, revealing their relative importance. Biocapacity, energy consumption, industrialization, financial development, life expectancy, and globalization displayed notably high PIPs, indicating their strong influence on the ecological footprint. In addition, the study employs cointegration tests to examine the long-run relationship between ecological footprint and explanatory variables. The results indicate significant cointegration between these variables across panels, supported by various test statistics. In the Weighted Pooled DOLS estimation, biocapacity, energy consumption, and life expectancy significantly influence the ecological footprint, while industrialization, financial development, and globalization exert a comparatively smaller impact. Researchers and policymakers should consider these determinants for effective sustainable development planning. These findings underscore the intricate interplay of factors shaping the ecological footprint and offer insights for effective policy interventions towards sustainable development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Property rights path, game model and case simulation of the coordination of the cross boundary water resources conflict","As an important natural resource, economic resource and strategic resource, the scarcity of water resources determines its economic characteristics and competitiveness of development and utilization. With the continuous development of economy and society, the scarcity of water resources will also continue to strengthen. In the sensitive areas of the region, the competitive development and utilization of water resources can easily lead to cross boundary water resources conflicts, especially the unclear property rights and inadequate administrative coordination, which has led to the intensification of cross boundary water resources conflicts. Industry management departments and academia are committed to seeking an effective coordination path for cross boundary water resources conflicts. Based on the analysis of the inefficiency of traditional administrative coordination methods, starting from the source of property rights of cross boundary water resources conflicts, they propose the use of market methods to water rights transactions between the world's bilateral stakeholders to resolve cross-border water conflicts. In this paper, a Bayesian evolutionary game model of incomplete information is established based on the gain function of both parties of the water rights transaction. The upstream local government or water-consuming enterprise is used as the water rights demand side, and the downstream local government is used as the water rights supplier. Asymmetry, the upstream government or water users and downstream governments do not fully understand actual information each other. Through evolutionary games, it is proposed to promote the smooth trading progress of water rights to resolve conflicts in water resources. There are two main ways: First, reduce the transaction costs of upstream and downstream regions. Second, improve the efficiency of water use in the upstream area and reduce the information asymmetry between two parties of the transaction. In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the evolutionary game model, the upstream and downstream water resources conflict events caused by the construction of Dayankeng Hydropower Station were selected as a sample case, and the above-mentioned evolutionary game model was simulated and analyzed using MATLAB simulation tools to further demonstrate the effects of the water use efficiency and transaction cost on transaction efficiency of both parties. First discuss the degree of information asymmetry between the two parties. Through numerical simulation, it can be concluded that only Dayankeng Hydropower Development Co., Ltd. believes that the water use efficiency of Shouning County in Fujian Province is inefficient and that Shouning County, Fujian Province has more than half the probability to believe that Dayankeng Hydropower when the water efficiency of the Development Co., Ltd. is high, the transaction can be concluded. And when Shouning County in Fujian Province believes that the higher the water use efficiency of Dayankeng Hydropower Station is, the faster the transaction is concluded. The following discusses the impact of transaction costs on the transaction process under the premise that both parties adopt a transaction strategy. It can be concluded that reducing transaction costs can shorten the time for both parties to reach a transaction. Especially when the transaction costs of both parties of the transaction are reduced at the same time, it can be seen that the transaction time of both parties is significantly shortened, which greatly improves the efficiency of the transaction. Based on the event of Dayankeng Hydropower Station, this paper proposes to start with the property rights of water resources conflicts by establishing the evolutionary game of both parties of the water rights transaction, and to provide a new way to resolve water disputes in cross boundary areas through water rights transactions and the establishment of water markets. The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) Improving the efficiency of water use in the upstream area and reducing the information asymmetry between the parties of the transaction can effectively promote the realization of water rights transactions. (2) The trading of water rights is an innovative way to coordinate cross-border water resources conflicts. Compared with administrative coordination, the trading of water rights has obvious advantages in cross-border water coordination. First, the optimal configuration can effectively alleviate the contradiction between the upstream and downstream water use, can prevent water disputes, promote the unity of water control in border areas, and maintain social stability. Second, according to the basic principles of economics, market transactions can improve overall social welfare, and cross-border water rights transactions in the basin can obtain obvious economic benefits. Usually, they can not only solve the problem of water demand in downstream areas, but also improve the water transfer economy in upstream areas and the revenue, such as power generation revenue. The third is to enrich the practice of basin water rights and water market theory, optimize the allocation of water resources, and extensively cultivate the basin water market. © 2020.

Implementation of and agriculture 4.0 oriented system for monitoring environmental variables: Alstroemeria hybrida - Astromelia case,"In recent times, agriculture faces new challenges due to climate change, water scarcity and the need to increase crop productivity, agriculture 4.0, through the application of technology allows real-time monitoring of environmental variables in crops such as astromelia, becoming a valuable tool for decision making of small farmers. This study implements a proposal oriented to agriculture 4.0 with the deployment of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) by making use of the ESP32 module, accompanied by soil moisture sensors YL-69, temperature and relative humidity DHT11 and rain sensor HL-83, for data acquisition, which will then be transmitted via a Wi-Fi connection to a MySQL database on a web server implemented for this purpose, allowing real-time monitoring through a web application developed using PHP, Javascript, HTML5, CSS, Jquery and Google Charts.The implementation of our proposal in a Phytotoldo dedicated to the cultivation of Astromelias, which allows to confirm the suitability of ESP32 modules and their associated sensors for real-time monitoring of environmental variables in the cultivation of Astromelias, and the correct recording of historical data for later evaluation to remain easily adaptable for other crop varieties. © 2023 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
Shallow burial of drip irrigation tape improves the water use efficiency of potatoes in semi-arid areas,"Water scarcity constrains potato production in arid and semiarid regions. Therefore, improving water use efficiency is critical for sustainable potato production. We use Inner Mongolia of China as a case site to examine the effects of shallowly burying drip irrigation tape (SSI) on water use efficiency over four years by comparing it with surface drip irrigation (SI) in terms of tuber yield, irrigation water productivity (WPI), root dry weight, leaf area index (LAI), dry matter accumulation of potatoes, and evapotranspiration. SSI reduced evaporation at early potato growth stages compared to SI by 8–26%. In comparison, SSI increased potato root dry weight after tuber initiation by 19.0%, which resulted in that LAI, plant dry matter accumulation from the tuber bulking to starch accumulation increased by 19.5% and 22.6%, respectively. Finally tuber yield under SSI increased by 8.0%, and the average WPI increased by 7.8%, compared to that under SI. Therefore, SSI can improve the water use efficiency of potatoes in semiarid region by reducing evaporation and enhancing potato root growth. This is significant for sustainable potato production in such an area. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Inflection point in climatic suitability of insect pest species in Europe suggests non-linear responses to climate change,"Climate change and globalization affect the suitable conditions for agricultural crops and insect pests, threatening future food security. It remains unknown whether shifts in species’ climatic suitability will be linear or rather non-linear, with crop exposure to pests suddenly increasing when a critical temperature threshold is crossed. Moreover, uncertainty of forecasts can arise because of the modelling approach based either on species distribution data or on physiological measurements. Here, we compared the predictions of two modelling approaches (physiological models and species distribution models) for forecasting the potential distribution of agricultural insect pests in Europe. Despite conceptual differences, we found good agreement overall between the two approaches. We further identified a potential regime change in pest pressure along a temperature gradient. With both modelling approaches, we found an inflection point in the number of pest species with suitable climatic conditions around a minimum temperature of the coldest month of −3°C. Our results could help decision-makers anticipate the onset of rising pest pressure and provide support for intensifying surveillance measures, particularly in regions where temperatures are already beyond the inflection point. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Management of health sector actions in drought situations,"Water is essential for the socio-economic development of a region and also for the survival of human beings. Water scarcity has direct and indirect impacts on the environment, the economy and human health. It can change the profile of morbidity and mortality of diseases, as well as having an impact on the supply of services that are essential public to the quality of life. This study aims to contextualize the occurrence of drought in Brazil, its effects on human health, as well as actions to be developed by the health sector to reduce the risk to those living in affected areas, with an emphasis on the monitoring of the quality of drinking water. This is a descriptive, qualitative study with a documental basis. The documents that were researched were related to initiatives by the Health Surveillance Secretariat of the Ministry of Health up until 2014. It is necessary to strengthen the performance capacity of the Unified Health System (SUS) in order to develop timely responses to reduce the risk to public health. © 2016, Associacao Brasileira de Pos – Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

Determining the Public Health Impact of Climate Change: A National Study Using a Health Impact Assessment Approach in Wales,"Objective: Climate change is recognised as the biggest threat to global health of the 21st century and impacts on health and wellbeing through a range of factors. Due to this, the need to take action in order to protect population health and wellbeing is becoming ever more urgent. Methods: In 2019, Public Health Wales carried out a comprehensive mixed-method Health Impact Assessment (HIA) of climate change. Unlike other risk assessments, it appraised the potential impact of climate change on health and inequalities in Wales through participatory workshops, stakeholder consultations, systematic literature reviews and case studies. Results: The HIA findings indicate potential impacts across the wider determinants of health and wellbeing. For example, air quality, excess heat/cold, flooding, economic productivity, infrastructure, and community resilience. A range of impacts were identified across population groups, settings, and geographical areas. Conclusion: These findings can inform decision-makers to prepare for climate change plans and policies using an evidence-informed approach. The work has demonstrated the value of a HIA approach by mobilising a range of evidence through a transparent process, resulting in transferrable learning for others.

"Environmental quality perceptions and health: A cross-sectional study of citizens of Kaunas, Lithuania","The perception of urban environmental quality is an important contributor when identifying local problems in sustainable development and environmental planning policy. This study examined the associations between environmental and social residential characteristics, physical activity, obesity, and hypertension in Kaunas city, Lithuania. This cross-sectional study analyzed 580 citizens’ demographic-, socioeconomic-, health-, and lifestyle-related factors, environmental health concerns, and environmental quality perceptions. Using Geographic Information Systems and the multivariate logistic regression, we found that the less physically active group more often presented lower than mean ratings of the quality of pathways and cycling routes (32.9% and 45.6%, p = 0.042) and only irregularly visited the natural environment. Obese participants presented poorer ratings of air pollution, the quality of pathways and cycling routes, their possibility to reach green spaces by walking, and the available relaxing areas. The environmental issues associated with hypertension were poor possibilities to reach green spaces by walking (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.14–3.32) and the availability of relaxation areas (OR 2.30, 95% 1.34–3.95). The quality of the neighborhood and individual-level characteristics were the factors that influenced a higher prevalence of health problems at the district level. Our findings suggest that a public health policy to improve the physical and social environment of the neighborhood would have a potential to increase citizens’ physical activity and health. © 2020 by the authors.

Reports of tropane alkaloid poisonings and analytical techniques for their determination in food crops and products from 2013 to 2023,"Food safety is crucial to attaining food security and sustainability. Unsafe foods for human and animal consumption lead to product recalls and rejection, negatively impacting the global economy and trade. Similarly, climate change can adversely affect the availability of safe and nutritious food at the table. The changing climatic conditions and global food trade and transport can make the movement of toxic plants possible, resulting in food crops being increasingly invaded by some species of plants that produce toxic secondary metabolites, such as tropane alkaloids (TAs). Datura stramonium from the Solanaceae plant family is an invasive and virulent plant that produces high amounts of two TAs, atropine and scopolamine. Various food poisoning events following accidental or deliberate ingestion of foods contaminated by atropine and scopolamine from seeds of D. stramonium have been recorded in different locations globally. Due to these incidents, regulatory agencies require the development of plant toxin detection methods that can be used in the food chain as early as possible. This systematic review thus focuses on the TA determination techniques in food and feeds published between 2013 and 2023. A particular focus was given to the sample preparation methods, the improvements of each technique claimed, and data to support the performance of each method, especially the ability to measure at or below the maximum level. The review concludes with other technological advancements, including rapid spectroscopy, electrophoresis, and colorimetric methods, as well as the possibility of coupling with smartphones for use in on-farm detection and the challenges in applying them. © 2024 The Author(s).

How much heat can we grow in our cities? Modelling UK urban biofuel production potential,"Biofuel provides a globally significant opportunity to reduce fossil fuel dependence; however, its sustainability can only be meaningfully explored for individual cases. It depends on multiple considerations including: life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, air quality impacts, food versus fuel trade-offs, biodiversity impacts of land use change and socio-economic impacts of energy transitions. One solution that may address many of these issues is local production of biofuel on non-agricultural land. Urban areas drive global change, for example, they are responsible for 70% of global energy use, but are largely ignored in their resource production potential; however, underused urban greenspaces could be utilized for biofuel production near the point of consumption. This could avoid food versus fuel land conflicts in agricultural land and long-distance transport costs, provide ecosystem service benefits to urban dwellers and increase the sustainability and resilience of cities and towns. Here, we use a Geographic Information System to identify urban greenspaces suitable for biofuel production, using exclusion criteria, in 10 UK cities. We then model production potential of three different biofuels: Miscanthus grass, short rotation coppice (SRC) willow and SRC poplar, within the greenspaces identified and extrapolate up to a UK-scale. We demonstrate that approximately 10% of urban greenspace (3% of built-up land) is potentially suitable for biofuel production. We estimate the potential of this to meet energy demand through heat generation, electricity and combined heat and power (CHP) operations. Our findings show that, if fully utilized, urban biofuel production could meet nearly a fifth of demand for biomass in CHP systems in the United Kingdom's climate compatible energy scenarios by 2030, with potentially similar implications for other comparable countries and regions. © 2019 The Authors.

Systemising gender integration with rural stakeholders' sustainability impact assessments: A case study with three low-input upgrading strategies,"Participatory action research across food value chains (FVC) can help stabilise the food security of subsistence farmers by implementing upgrading strategies (UPS). These strategies can be assessed ex-ante and ex-post for their potential social, ecological and economic sustainability impacts. UPS implementation, however, often entails gender-specific changes and challenges in a farmer's social life, economy and environment that either were not perceived and anticipated beforehand or are not followed up during UPS implementation. Before and during their implementation, therefore, UPS need to be entirely understood and assessed by both genders in terms of their potential social, ecological and economic sustainability impacts. This article conceptualises a systematic framework for integrating gender in sustainability impact assessments and presents gender-based assessment differences in three low-input UPS in Tanzanian FVC. We conducted ex-ante and ex-post impact assessments using nine food security criteria developed earlier by the authors following the Framework of Participatory Impact Assessment (FoPIA). Sustainability impact assessments—to a greater extent than expected—differed to various extents between the genders for a) different food security criteria, b) different sustainability dimensions (economic, social, and environmental), c) different points in time (T0, T1) of assessments, d) different implemented UPS, and e) different members within the groups of female and/or male stakeholders. The results demonstrate the substantial importance of integrating female-male segregated assessments and perceptions before and while implementing food-securing UPS. We anticipate that integrating these assessments and perceptions as regular components will lead to better gendered social learning for both scientists and stakeholders and a holistic understanding of complex local food systems. © 2017 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Capturing the drivers of crop water footprints in Africa and its spatial patterns,"Improving water efficiency in the agricultural sector is essential to ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater in a context of increasing water scarcity and human water demand. The water footprint (WF) is an established metric of resource intensity while the drivers steering WF over time remain under-researched. To advance this line of research, this paper assesses the sign and magnitude of macroeconomic, climatic, and agronomic drivers on the agricultural crop WF in 43 countries of the African continent for the period 2002–2016, using econometric panel data techniques and considering potential spatial patterns. The results reveal a significant spatial dependence in the WF across neighbouring countries. Socioeconomic factors are the most important determinant of water productivity, indicating that economic development facilitates a falling water requirement per unit of production. A negative impact of the temperature variation on the WF is also found, while the share of total land dedicated to agriculture tends to increase the crop WF in the continent. These results support designing adequate agricultural and water management policies to achieve sustainable and resilient food systems capable of adapting to anticipated population growth, climate change and other future threats to human health, prosperity and environmental sustainability in Africa. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of Future Climate Projections on the Water Balance of the Gediz Basin in Turkey,"Located along the western coast of Turkey, the Gediz Basin counts on agriculture as its most important economic activity. Over the last few decades, the basin has been facing water-related problems, such as water scarcity and competing use of water. However, an investigation of possible future water demands and droughts is expected to be helpful for water managers dealing with the future water planning and management of the region. As such, this study aims at evaluating the future water balances occurring in the major reservoir of the basin during the 21st century. For this purpose, four future water supply projections are generated using a hydro-climate modeling framework. This framework includes the coupling of a regional climate model, the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, and a fully physically-based hydrologic model, the watershed environmental hydrology (WEHY) model, under two IPCC representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of a CMIP5 global climate model, HadGEM2-ES. A dynamic water balance model is, then, developed to carry out reservoir simulations and is used to operate the reservoir with the projected future flowrates in order to identify water deficits or surpluses under the projected irrigation water demands for the years between 2015 and 2100. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Not About Sufficiency

Fish provision in a changing environment: The buffering effect of regional trade networks,"Local and regional trade networks in small-scale fisheries are important for food security and livelihoods across the world. Such networks consist of both economic flows and social relationships, which connect different production regions to different types of fish demand. The structure of such trade networks, and the actions that take place within them (e.g., people fishing, buying, selling), can influence the capacity of small-scale fisheries to provide sufficient fish in a changing social and ecological context. In this study, we aim to understand the importance of networks between different types of traders that access spatially-distinct fish stocks for the availability and variability of fish provision. We deployed a mixed-methods approach, combining agent-based modelling, network analysis and qualitative data from a small-scale fishery in Baja California Sur, Mexico. The empirical data allowed us to investigate the trade processes that occur within trade networks; and the generation of distinct, empirically-informed network structures. Formalized in an agent-based model, these network structures enable analysis of how different trade networks affect the dynamics of fish provision and the exploitation level of fish stocks. Model results reveal how trade strategies based on social relationships and species diversification can lead to spillover effects between fish species and fishing regions. We found that the proportion of different trader types and their spatial connectivity have the potential to increase fish provision. However, they can also increase overexploitation depending on the specific connectivity patterns and trader types. Moreover, increasing connectivity generally leads to positive outcomes for some individual traders, but this does not necessarily imply better outcomes at the system level. Overall, our model provides an empirically-grounded, stylized representation of a fisheries trading system, and reveals important trade-offs that should be considered when evaluating the potential effect of future changes in regional trade networks. © 2021 González-Mon et al.

"Human rights, environmental justice, and the North-South divide","From the Ogoni people devastated by oil drilling in Nigeria to the Inuit and other indigenous populations threatened by climate change, communities disparately burdened by environmental degradation are increasingly framing their demands for environmental justice in the language of environmental human rights. However, some scholars have expressed scepticism about the environmental human rights project. First, they remind us that the human rights governance capacity of many states in the global South has been compromised by the neoliberal economic reforms imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as well as by trade and investment agreements. Second, they question the ability of human rights law to adequately articulate and advance the aspirations and resistance strategies of diverse grassroots social justice movements, and warn us about the susceptibility of human rights law to co-optation by powerful Northern states. This Chapter examines the promise and the peril of environmental human rights as a means of challenging environmental injustice within nations and the North-South dimension of environmental injustice. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2015.

Ensuring household food security through enhanced production of pechay ( Brassica rapa L.) as influenced by different levels of carbonized rice hull integration,"Household gardens have been a staple of many rural areas in the region. However, due to limited space, a need to intensify productivity while maintaining our natural resources has risen to the forefront of research innovativeness. The productivity and economic efficiency of pechay applied with varying rates of carbonized rice hull (CRH) were evaluated from February 2021 to April 2021. The study was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design with five (5) growing media as treatments (T1 - garden soil with the recommended rate of NPK; T2 - growing media (GM) consisting of mixtures of garden soil, chicken dung, and coco peat; T3 - GM + 5% CRH; T4 - GM + 10% CRH; and T5 - GM + 15% CRH) with three (3) replications. Results revealed that the integration of 5% CRH with specialized mixed growing media (T3) significantly increased yield attaining 102.13 kg per 100 m2. Utilization of specialized growing media (T2, T3, T4, and T5) either with or without integration of CRH has higher dry matter yield which was significantly higher than plants harvested from plots grown with purely garden soil. Cost and return analysis revealed that pechay production utilizing the specialized growing media with the integration of 10% CRH obtained the highest return of expenses of Php 2.57 which was significantly higher than the rest of the treatments. The study concludes that the addition of 10% CRH to specialized mixed media is promising based on its yield performance and return on cost invested, thus, it is highly recommended. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Improving water productivity in irrigated agriculture: Challenges from climate change and new water resources paradigms,"The increasing pressure on water resources is due to continuously growing consumption, which itself results from demographic and economic developments and the effect of expected climate change.Therefore, action to encourage the more efficient and productive use of water is urgent.Water management needs to focus on regulating the use of this limited resource by multiple users; the allocation of water to non-agricultural users, in particular, is increasing steadily.Moreover, increased variability in climate regimes is expected to modify the volume, temporal and spatial distribution of water storage and fluxes, and therefore to affect the distribution, availability and sustainability of regional water resources.Irrigated agriculture is one of the sectors also facing new challenges.Given that water scarcity is expected to worsen in large agricultural production areas, one such challenge is how to maintain or increase sustainable agricultural production under growing water use restrictions.Improvements in agricultural water management should seek to conserve not only water but energy and soil, too, while still satisfying society’s relentless demand for high quality food and fiber crops, and livestock, aquatic and forest products.This work addresses the main problems related to this topic, illustrated with case studies from Europe and Asia. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of Air Pollution Impacts and Monitoring Data Limitations of a Spring 2019 Chemical Facility Fire,"Fires, explosions, and spills at petrochemical industry facilities create air pollution exposure risks for surrounding residences, which are disproportionately communities of color and low-income communities. This study analyzed local air pollution before, during, and after a 2019 industrial fire at the International Terminals Company’s Deer Park facility in Houston, Texas. Meteorological conditions and pollution data from handheld, vehicular, and stationary monitors were analyzed. The fire produced elevated pollution levels in nearby residential areas. After the fire, benzene concentrations reached levels of concern for human health; particulate matter levels did not. Monitoring data gaps limited our ability to assess potential health effects of the fire; however, this does not suggest that industrial fires have minimal or no impacts on community exposure. In the absence of monitoring data, public health threats can be assessed by studying the scale of the incident, chemicals involved, meteorological conditions, and proximity to residential areas. The air pollution exposure and health effects of acute industrial emissions events can be significant but are not often captured by existing monitoring networks. Regulators and petrochemical companies can take steps to minimize the risk of industrial incidents and better monitor and convey risks to communities. © Gretchen T.

"Relative contributions of global warming to various climate sensitive risks, and their implications for adaptation and mitigation","A rationale for mitigating global warming (GW) is that warming might exacerbate many of today's urgent problems - hunger, malaria, water shortage, coastal flooding, and habitat conversion - which could be particularly problematic for developing countries. Recent assessments of the global impacts of climate change indicate that into the 2080s, except for coastal flooding, GW's contribution to these problems [ΔP(GW)] would be small compared to P(BASELINE), the problem's magnitude in the absence of warming, i.e., under baseline conditions. Hence, mitigation can, at best, reduce only the smaller portion of the total problem [= ΔP(GW) + P(BASELINE)]. To compound matters, costs of markedly reducing ΔP(GW) through mitigation are high; moreover, because of the inertia of the climate system, its benefits are backloaded while costs have to be horne up front for decades. Discounting further magnifies this asymmetry between costs and benefits. By contrast, approaches that would help societies cope with or reduce vulnerabilities to the urgent problems noted above would, by reducing both P(BASELINE) and ΔP(GW), deliver greater benefits. Devising and/or using such approaches now would allow benefits to accrue in relatively short order, and help societies adapt to GW's future impacts, if and when those impacts become significant. With regard to coastal flooding, the exception to the rule that ΔP(GW) < P(BASELINE), protecting against such flooding (i.e., adaptation) is, into the 2080s, substantially cheaper than the Kyoto Protocol despite the latter's comparatively modest reduction requirements. Thus, relative to mitigation, for the next several decades the benefits of such adaptation are likely to be larger, occur sooner, more certainly, and more contemporaneously with costs. Hence, over this period adaptation is probably more cost-effective than mitigation. In particular, the Kyoto Protocol delivers too little too late, and costs too much. Importantly, by reducing hunger, malaria, water shortage, and habitat loss now, such adaptation approaches would enable sustainable development and improve human well-being in its various dimensions, especially in developing countries. In turn, that would further enhance their ability to adapt to or mitigate climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
"Impacts of Climate Change of Paddy Farming in Four Iraqi Rural Communities: The Case of Al Najaf, Al Qadisiyah, Al Muthanna and Thi Qar","Impacts of climate change on paddy farming of four districts (Al Najaf, Al Qadisiyah, Al Muthanna and Thi Qar) in the south of Iraq were investigated for the period 1966–2015. Changes in annual precipitations, minimum and maximum temperatures, relative humidity, paddy-cultivated lands, yields and total productions were investigated. Effects of changing climate parameters on paddy farming were assessed. Present findings revealed increasing average annual minimum and maximum temperatures and decreasing annual total precipitations and relative humidity. This scenario explicitly indicated how Iraqi agriculture (especially paddy farming) and irrigation sectors were suffering from the scarcity of rainfall and rising temperatures because Iraqi agriculture and irrigation systems largely dependent on these two factors. As temperature, rainfall and availability of irrigation water have cumulative effects on paddy production and all those components are adversely affected by climate change, Iraqi paddy production is decreasing with the adverse impacts of climate change. Evidently, rice yields (ton per hectare) of these provinces are also decreasing noticeably. Present findings clearly revealed that climate change and resultant dry periods had various adverse impacts on food security, poverty, paddy production and overall agricultural productivity. It was concluded that Iraqi government should take some initiatives to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on paddy yields. Iraqi government should also put a greater emphasis on policy formulation to find out the ways of adaptation and reduction of negative impacts of climate change. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Managing food and water security in Small Island States: New evidence from economic modelling of climate stressed groundwater resources,"Climate-stressed groundwater resources present a growing challenge for protecting food security and economic sustainability, notably in Small Island Developing States (SIDS). These states are some of the most vulnerable to climate stress because of their large coastlines, vulnerability to rising sea levels, weak access to reliable surface water, and limited food production capacity for handling increased groundwater scarcity. Impacts of climate stressed groundwater resources brought on by irrigation and growing urban demand in SIDS continue to receive widespread attention by both scientists and policymakers. Policies that limit pumping to protect aquifer sustainability reduce short-term economic welfare by unknown amounts that would otherwise be secured by both urban and irrigation water users. Yet, little scholarly research has addressed economic impacts of climate-water stress for the special needs of SIDS for which urban and irrigation pumping compete hydrologically and economically over long time periods. The original contribution of this work is to address that gap by employing downscaled data on precipitation from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) climate scenarios. Its novel contribution is to conceptualize, develop, apply, and interpret an integrated hydro-economic framework to understand interconnected physical and economic linkages from managing an unconfined regional aquifer system under each of three climate and two policy scenarios. The application is to Barbados, a SIDS, for which current and future irrigation and urban demands compete for water. The framework integrates groundwater hydrology, climate scenarios, economics, land use, and groundwater management, with the intent to mitigate impacts of climate stress on current economic values of water as well as protecting future aquifer sustainability. Results provide a framework to guide water management for SIDS vulnerable to climate stress for which water of the right quantity, quality, timing, location, and price are essential elements of economic development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Incorporating energy justice and equity objectives in power system models,"Ensuring an equitable energy transition requires models and tools that can account for equity and energy justice goals. Power system models (PSMs) are widely used throughout industry, government, and academia to simulate or optimize the operations and planning of current and future electricity systems under different scenarios, parameter assumptions and policy frameworks. These models are important tools that allow users to understand how the power system may evolve under different future conditions, but importantly, they are also used to inform policy implementation and investment decisions across all aspects of the power system. However, existing models seldom include energy justice considerations and therefore energy justice priorities are not reflected in the policies and other decision-making processes that are informed by these models. The purpose of this review is to provide a framework that energy modelers can draw upon to integrate energy justice and equity goals into PSMs. To this end, 99 papers that examine the intersection of energy justice and power system models are summarized and ten core aspects of the power system that can impact energy justice outcomes, and therefore require new modeling approaches, are identified. This review then establishes key current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with capturing energy justice considerations in power system models across these ten aspects. This review concludes by proposing four key research directions that should be pursued to improve the representation of energy justice and equity in power system modeling. Finally, this review also addresses challenges raised by United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7, which aims to ensure affordable energy access to everyone and Sustainable Development Goal 13, which aims to take urgent action to address climate change. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Economics and Public Health: Two Perspectives on Firearm Injury Prevention,"Firearm injury is a major cause of death, disability, and other harms to community well-being across the U.S. Economics and public health offer two complementary perspectives to conceptualize gun violence and formulate strategies to mitigate related harms. Economics offers methods and procedures for tabulating costs of firearm injury and offers an explicit, albeit imperfect normative framework to evaluate proposed interventions. Economics’ focus on incentives, trade-offs, and resources constraints provides useful mechanisms for understanding illegal firearm markets and firearm use that can inform crime reduction efforts. Public health methods and interventions help to measure patterns of illness and disease, identify risks and protective factors, and inform prevention efforts for the most vulnerable individuals and communities. Public health also focuses attention on social determinants and structural factors in designing and evaluating interventions to prevent, address, and mitigate the consequences of gun violence. © 2023 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.",Not About Sufficiency
"The world market of fragrant rice, main issues and perspectives","Worldwide rice production totaled 481 million metric tons in 2011, including 7.1% in trade. Fragrant rice is estimated to account for 15-18% of the rice trade procuring the highest prices on the world market. Some new players are interested in entering this premium segment, including the US, Vietnam, and other rice growers and traders. The fragrant rice commodity chain is deciphered through a meta-analysis of data on rice cropping and trading. We conclude on a possible split between fragrant and coarse rice markets.

Achieving the SDGs: Evaluating indicators to be used to benchmark and monitor progress towards creating healthy and sustainable cities,"In 2016, the World Health Organization declared that ‘Health is one of the most effective markers of any city's successful sustainable development’ (World Health Organisation, 2016). With estimates that around 6.7 billion people will live in cities by 2050, 21st century city planning decisions will play a critical role in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They will determine the city structure and access to health-enhancing (or health-damaging) urban environments, and ultimately lifestyle choices that impact both individual and planetary health. Benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating city planning policies and interventions is therefore critical to optimise urban outcomes. In 2017, the UN adopted a global SDG indicator framework, calling for complementary national and regional indicators to be collected by member countries. UN Habitat has also developed an indicator action framework specifically for cities. This paper examined the extent to which the UN indicators will help cities evaluate their efforts to deliver sustainability and health outcomes. It identified inconsistencies between the two UN indicator frameworks. Many of the SDG indicators assess outcomes, rather than the comprehensive and integrated ‘upstream’ policies and interventions required to deliver outcomes on-the-ground. Conversely, the UN Habitat framework incorporates intervention indicators, but excludes health outcome indicators. A more comprehensive approach to benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating policies designed to achieve healthy and sustainable cities and assessing spatial inequities is proposed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Review: Mitigating the risks posed by intensification in livestock production: the examples of antimicrobial resistance and zoonoses,"Major shifts in how animals are bred, raised and slaughtered are involved in the intensification of livestock systems. Globally, these changes have produced major increases in access to protein-rich foods with high levels of micronutrients. Yet the intensification of livestock systems generates numerous externalities including environmental degradation, zoonotic disease transmission and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. Where the process of intensification is most advanced, the expertise, institutions and regulations required to manage these externalities have developed over time, often in response to hard lessons, crises and challenges to public health. By exploring the drivers of intensification, the foci of future intensification can be identified. Low- and middle-income (LMICs) countries are likely to experience significant intensification in livestock production in the near future; however, the lessons learned elsewhere are not being transferred rapidly enough to develop risk mitigation capacity in these settings. At present, fragmentary approaches to address these problems present an incomplete picture of livestock populations, antimicrobial use, and disease risks in LMIC settings. A worldwide improvement in evidence-based zoonotic disease and AMR management within intensifying livestock production systems demands better information on the burden of livestock-associated disease, antimicrobial use and resistance and resources allocated to mitigation. © 2020 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Irrigation impact on leaf area and net photosynthetic productivity of canola,"Crop productivity closely depends on the rate of leaf area development. The larger the leaf area is, the more photosynthetically active radiation is absorbed by plant, and the more dry-matter is accumulated. Water plays a key role to these processes. Since the climatic tendencies reveal future water scarcity in the Balkans, increasing irrigation water efficiency should be the main issue for the irrigated agriculture. The goal of the paper is to estimate the impact of different water supply on the rate of canola leaf area development and on the productivity of photosynthesis. Data of a field experiment with three varieties of was processed. The experiment was conducted in Sofia region, Bulgaria, on chromic luvisols. Three levels of soil moisturizing were applied - full irrigation (80 % of FC maintained), 50 % deficit irrigation and rain-fed conditions. Leaf area, biomass and dry matter were estimated five times during the spring vegetation period. The rate of leaf area index (LAI), photosynthetic potential, and net photosynthetic productivity (NPP) was calculated. The results show considerable impact of irrigation on those indicators, as well as on the final seed and oil yield. This investigation caters for the interests of Bulgarian canola production in the terms of the current EU strategy for climate change mitigation and energy assurance. © 2013 Czech University of Life Sciences Prague.",Not About Sufficiency
"Climate Change and Small-Scale Agriculture in the Eastern Cape Province: Investigating the Nexus of Awareness, Adaptation, and Food Security","Climate change poses a significant threat to global agriculture, particularly for small-scale farmers who often lack the resources and knowledge to adapt. Without effective coping and adaptation strategies, agriculture in Africa is likely to suffer, leading to increased poverty and food insecurity. Adaptation to climate change is closely linked to farmers’ awareness of the issue, though the extent of this awareness in South Africa remains unclear due to conflicting previous studies. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between climate change awareness, adaptation strategies, and food security among small-scale farmers in the Eastern Cape Province, with the aim of understanding how farmers’ awareness of climate change influences their adaptation decisions and the subsequent impact on agricultural productivity and food security. The study used quantitative analysis to examine the relationship between climate change knowledge, adaptation, and food security. Multi-stage sampling was used to collect data from 200 small-scale farmers through semi-structured questionnaires. Logit regression and endogeneity switching regression were applied for data analysis. The study finds that small-scale farmers in the province are fully aware of climate change and have experienced its negative impacts, especially reduced farm returns (38%) and yields (36%), which threaten agricultural productivity, food security, and farmers’ economic viability. In response, farmers have adopted various strategies, including crop rotation (22%), using improved crop varieties (20%), changing planting dates (12%), and applying fertilizer or mulching (12%). Key factors influencing adaptation include age, access to climate information, education, market proximity, extension services, drought frequency, temperature and rainfall perceptions, radio ownership, farm income, size, and family size. The study shows that these adaptation strategies have improved agricultural yields and farm returns, positively contributing to food security in the area. Based on the study findings, this study recommends that governments and policymakers implement and provide targeted policy interventions, extension services, and educational programs that can enhance climate change knowledge among small-scale farmers. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The increasing threat of Rift Valley fever virus globalization: strategic guidance for protection and preparation,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Bunyavirales: Phlebovirus) is a prominent vector-borne zoonotic disease threat to global agriculture and public health. Risks of introduction into nonendemic regions are tied to changing climate regimes and other dynamic environmental factors that are becoming more prevalent, as well as virus evolutionary factors and human/animal movement. Endemic to the African continent, RVFV has caused large epizootics at the decadal scale since the early 20th century but has spread to the Arabian Peninsula and shows increasing patterns of interepizootic transmission on the annual scale.This virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes as well as through direct contact with infected tissues and can cause sporadic to widespread morbidity and mortality in domestic ungulate livestock as well as humans. High viremias in infected livestock moved for legal and illegal trade as well as in infected mosquitoes or human travelers can spread this virus worldwide. With increasing global commerce, it is likely RVFV will be introduced to new areas with suitable hosts, mosquito vector species, and environments. However, the strong mosquito component of RVFV epidemiology combined with advancements in vaccines, diagnostics, and virus evolutionary factors create opportunities for strategies to leverage models of connectivity among potential source and emerging regions to target surveillance and mitigation activities to reduce the risk of RVFV introduction, or contain the virus should it be introduced, into new regions. © 2023 Oxford University Press.

Health expenditure and FDI in Europe,"The quality of local institutions and the governmental measures sustaining Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) are some of the traditional determinants of multinational agglomerations. One institution which has so far been under-investigated is the health system. Yet several empirical contributions have shown that health is a constituent part of human capital (Bloom and Canning, 2004; Alsan et al., 2006; Ogundari and Awokuse, 2018). Therefore, the quality of the health system may be considered an important FDI attractor factor alongside infrastructures, education, labor force and R&D expenditure (Ingram and Silverman, 2002; Blomström, 2006). The aim of this contribution is to investigate the role of different national institutional settings in attracting FDI within the 28 Member States of the European Union. More specifically, the research focuses on the relation between health expenditure and FDI, assuming that a proxy for institutional quality is the percentage of public health expenditure on the total health expenditure. We adopt a panel GLS methodology with heteroskedasticity and specific autocorrelation and we use a dataset for the 28 European countries that are part of the EU in the period 2000–2013. By means of three model-specifications, we investigate the relation between the inward stock of FDI and: the percentage of government health expenditure on the total health care expenditure; the percentage of Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) expenditure on the total private health care expenditure; and the health coverage regime. We also explore the relation between FDI and population health, a facet of human infrastructure (Globerman and Shapiro, 2002) expressed by healthy life years (HLYs) and the percentage of population claiming to be in perfect/good health. Control variables relate to government regulatory quality, market dimension, government effort in R&D in higher education; and labor productivity. In all models the relation among the dependent variable and the explicative variables related to health expenditure is always significant and, unsurprisingly, it is positive for the percentage of public health expenditure and negative for the percentage of OOP expenditure. The variables describing population health are always positively related to FDI, though population health, expressed in HLYs, is always statistically significant. In contrast, the variable concerning the self-assessment of population good health is only significant in the model where the dummies representing the health coverage regimes are not considered. These last variables appear to absorb the effect of population good health on FDI. Our results are consistent with the idea that health is a component of human infrastructure and is influenced by public policies and governments (Globerman and Shapiro, 2002). Both human infrastructure (resources-population health) and governance infrastructure (institutions-health systems) are key features of a country and determine its potential in attracting FDI. © 2019 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland",Not About Sufficiency
"Impact of changing urban form and production-living-ecological space on changing ecosystem services of a smart city of Eastern India, Durgapur","Worldwide land use land cover (LULC) transformation become a serious issue in the last few decades due to its immense importance in environmental and human well-being perspectives. Expansion of urban areas at the expense of natural land covers and changing urban form is mainly responsible for changing environmental conditions. This study focused on identifying the impacts of LULC change on environmental conditions through the assessment of changing ecosystem services (ESs) of the Durgapur Municipal Corporation (DMC) from 1990 to 2020. Changing ESs are assessed based on changing urban forms and production-living-ecological space (PLES) components. Results found that the compactness of urban areas is increasing along with the outward expansion. The core urban area of DMC has risen from 8.11% to 30.11% during 1990–2020. Similarly, living space increased from 15.57% to 42.60%, production space decreased from 53.06% to 25.59%, and ecological space fluctuated from 1990 to 2020. This transformation of PLES components negatively affects DMC’s environmental condition, affecting the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These significant results may be utilized to understand changing environmental conditions and priority issues for DMC’s future sustainable urban development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability concern in Indian agriculture: Needs science-led innovation and structural reforms,"Agriculture in India is facing several challenges which together are manifested into the sustainability issues. The broad contours of the agricultural production system in the country have been defined by the need to achieve food security which calls for close attention to rice-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system of the Indo- Gangetic Plains (IGP) whose sustainability is under threat. Degradation of natural resources, severe biotic and abiotic stresses specially drought, floods, pest infestations with accompanying impacts on biodiversity and agricultural productivity are the major constraints to agricultural development. Further, climate change has gained significant global attention over the past decade due to concerns of deleterious long-term impacts on agriculture, water supply, human welfare, regional and political stability. All the related issues need to be addressed on priority, with particular emphasis on soil-carbon through a holistic approach. As the strategy brings focus on income of farmers, the agricultural technology needs to move from “Production oriented-Green Revolution” to “Farmer’s Income oriented- Revolution” and environmentally sustainable farming. Therefore, for long-term sustainability in agriculture, 4 pillars/ components (good agricultural practices, climate-change mitigation and adaptation, diversification of highvalue crops and biodiversity management) needs to be addressed properly, more importantly good agricultural practices (GAP). The GAPs are based on the principles of risk prevention, risk analysis, sustainable agriculture, and integrated crop management (ICM), which are of utmost importance in present time. The GAPs for agricultural sustainability are reduced tillage, conservation agriculture, resource-conservation technologies (RCTs), erosioncontrol measures, diversified cropping system, micro-irrigation, balanced fertilization, manuring, watershed management, organic farming, and integrated farming systems etc. Now that the vision is to impart income security to the farmers of the country, diversification of the system across all the sub-sectors of agriculture assumes importance which is, indeed a de-risking mechanism capable of negotiating both endogenous and exogenous risks associated with the system. The effective and efficient management of agro-biodiversity is also essential through management of genebanks, science-led innovations; livelihood, food and nutrition security though crop diversification, use of lesser-known crops and wild relatives in crop improvement; dealing appropriately with quarantine, biosafety and bio-security. © 2020, Indian Society of Agronomy.

Conservation agriculture towards achieving food security in North East India,"Productivity of rainfed monocropping farming system in North Eastern Region of India is low and it is a high economic risk activity. Intensive natural resources mining, continuous degradation of natural resources (soil, water, vegetation) and practice of monocropping under conventional agricultural practices will not ensure farm productivity and food security in the coming years. In order to keep the production system in different land situations sustainable, conservation agriculture based on no-till system is an alternative to reconcile agriculture with its environment and overcome the imposed constraints of climate change and continuous inputs cost. Studies on conservation tillage and residue management in different land situations were conducted during 2006-2009 and they are highlighted in this article. In terrace upland, growing mustard completely on residual moisture following upland rice/maize was possible when it is practised under conservation tillage (crop residue of all crops, including weed biomass incorporated). Similarly, in valley upland, growing second crop of pea in rice fallow is possible if two-thirds or half of rice residues are retained on the soil surface under zero tillage. A longterm study (2006-2009) revealed that double no-till practice in rice-based system is cost-effective, restored soil organic carbon (70.75%), favoured biological activity (46.7%), conserved water and produced yield (49%) higher than conventional tillage. Therefore, conservation tillage practised in terrace upland, valley upland and low-land situations ensured doublecropping, improved farm income and livelihood in rainfed NE India.",Not About Sufficiency

Perspectives of ecological footprint in European context under the impact of information society and sustainable development,"The perspective of ecological footprint, which is a tool for measuring and monitoring the sustainability of the new information society and the higher degree of openness in the European economy powered by the globalization process, was approached from the viewpoint of accelerated technical, scientific, and innovative progress. This research aims at identifying and forecasting patterns of environmental footprint behavior in European countries, depending on factors reflecting the innovation activity, the degree of economic freedom, and EU membership status. In the article, three factors are identified that explain to a large extent the variation of the ecological footprint values: employment in foreign controlled enterprises, eco-innovation index, and region. The statistical and econometric methods used in the analysis are aimed at applying a Proportional-Odds Cumulative Logistic regression model in order to verify the existence of the association between the statistical variables and to forecast the likelihood of changing the ecological footprint from a lower to a higher score under the impact of selected factors by quantifying their influence. The results have led to the conclusion that, by applying the model, both the share of the employed population in the foreign-controlled enterprises and the eco-innovation index will have a significant direct influence on the variability in the ecological footprint (through the odds-ratio). Referring to the EU membership, the model shows that non-EU member countries or newer EU member countries are predominantly assigned low ecological footprint scores. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Causes of agricultural terraces degradation in Al-Kimmah watershed (Yemen),"The agricultural terraces in north western Semi-arid highland in Yemen have always played an important role in social stability of rural population. However, since the second half of the twentieth century, these terraces have been subjected to continuous degradation that could endanger the fragile socio-economic development in these areas. This study aims at understanding and investigating the causes of the agricultural terraces degradation in Al-Kimmah Kuhlan Affar Hajjah region. The agricultural terraces of the representative watershed were divided into four groups mainly; salubrious (no degraded) terraces (group A), slightly degraded (group B), moderately degraded (group C) and highly degraded (Group D) based on the rate of destruction and collapse of stone walls. The study of socio-economic factors has been conducted on a sample of 40 farmers spreading across the watershed and covering the four groups of terraces. The study of environmental factors was conducted through observations and field measurements from 98 sites representing all forms of degradation. Statistical analysis of data revealed that 18 socio-economic and 12 environmental factors are statistically (p <0.05) linked to the agricultural terraces degradation. Altogether, the causes of the agricultural terraces degradation are social, economic and environmental in their nature. The most influential factors are the exodus of the local workforce, the low agricultural productivity, the lack of profitability and steep slopes. Moreover, it also appears from this study that the steep slopes, the mountainous landscape, the presence of rock outcrops, the spontaneous vegetation and the dark color of the soil are good indicators of land degradation in Al- Kimmah Kuhlan Affar area.",Not About Sufficiency
Ghana.,"The government of Ghana sees the country's population as a valuable natural resource and emphasizes national population policy as an important part of overall socioeconomic planning and development. A formal system of development planning has been in effect since 1951. Decennial censuses are conducted relatively regularly but vital registration is thought to be incomplete. The current population size is 11,679,000 and the current rate of natural increase (3.1%) is considered too high, constraining the achievement of socioeconomic development. The high rate of growth is taxing on employment and public services. High fertility rates are influenced both by regional norms, such as early and universal marriage, and demographic factors, i.e., an increasingly higher proportion of the population in the 0-14 age group. The government sponsors family planning services which can be obtained free or at subsidized rates and seeks to upgrade the health and living standards of the population. Sterilization is permitted for medical reasons only, and abortions are restricted. Crude death rates have declined steadily and are currently estimated at 21-23/1000 population. The infant mortality rate is approximately 125.7/1000 live births. These rates are considered unacceptable and budget allocations for curative and preventive services have continuously risen. Uneven regional distribution of services continues to be problematic. Efforts to curb immigration in 1969 are thought to have resulted in the current satisfactory situation. Restrictive measures to prevent the emigration of skilled personnel are in effect. 60-65% of the population are urban dwellers and the proportion is expected to increase. The current spatial distribution of the population is considered inappropriate, rapid urbanization is causing rural depopulation, overburdening urban services and accentuating rural-urban disparaties. 2 approaches to the problem have been implemented: the urban increase is accomodated by increasing outlays for services, and new public investments are widely dispersed, particularly in rural areas.

Trend and change-point detection analyses of rainfall and temperature over the Awash River basin of Ethiopia,"Awash River basin (ARB) as a system is in a state of continuous change that requires successive studies to discern the changes or trends of climatic elements through time due to climate change/variability, and other socioeconomical developmental activities in the basin. The livelihood of communities in the ARB is primarily based on rainfall-dependent agriculture. Effects of rainfall anomalies such as reduction of agricultural productivity, water scarcity, and food insecurity are becoming more prevalent in this area. In recent years, ARB has been experiencing more frequent rainfall anomalies that change-point detection test and trend analyses of basin rainfall associated with sea surface temperature is crucial in providing guidance to improve agricultural productivity in ARB. Change-point detection tests such as Pettit's, the von Neumann ratio (VNR), Buishand's range (BR) and standard normal homogeneity (SNH) plus trend analysis Mann-Kendall (MK) test of rainfall and temperature data from 29 meteorological stations in the ARB were carried out from 1986 to 2016. A significant increasing trend of annual and seasonal temperature was found. The temperature change-points for the annual and major rainy season (MRS) were detected in 2001, while for the minor rainy season (mRS) in 1997. A significant decreasing trend, shift, and high variability of rainfall were detected in the downstream part of the ARB. The BR and SNH results showed that the mRS rainfall change-point was in 1998, with a subsequent mean annual decrease of 52.5 mm. The increase (decrease) of rainfall in the annual and MRS was attributable to La Niña (El Niño) events. The significant decreasing trend and change-point of rainfall in the mRS was attributable to the steady warming of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, local warming, and La Niña events. With this knowledge of the current trends and change-point for rainfall and temperature in the ARB, it is therefore essential that appropriate integrated water management and water-harvesting technologies are established, especially in the downstream areas. Moreover, early detection of El Niño episodes would provide invaluable warning of impending rainfall anomalies in the ARB and would enable better preparations to mitigate its negative effects. © 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Food security and small holder farming in Pacific Island countries and territories: A scoping review,"UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger links ending hunger to achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. The Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) is a region where such linkages can be investigated as the PICTs are confronting climate change while facing a decrease in available arable land and increasing rates of urbanisation. Around 80% of all Pacific Islanders still rely on agricultural produce from their own gardens or from small holder farmers to support or to supplement their diets. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has declared the years 2019–2028 to be the Decade of Family Farming. Food imports are increasingly common in PICTs, and can provide cheap, although not particularly nutritious foods, leading to generalised health problems. Increased reliance on imports is itself an indicator of diminishing food security, and with the PICTs facing a range of food security challenges, it is timely to assess the existing literature in the PICTs on the relationship between smallholder farming and food security. This scoping review analyses 49 peer reviewed and grey literature studies in English from 1970–2019 concerning the relationship between food security and small holder farming in the PICTs. It identifies four main themes: (1) Community adaptation, resilience and crop diversification; (2) Decreased availability of local foods and land; (3) Changes in diet; (4) Gender and agricultural production. The review shows Pacific peoples quickly adapt to changing circumstances to plant different crops both for food and for sale, and it identifies the role of small holder agriculture as crucial to: (1) growing local foods to support food security, and (2) expanding domestic asset creation to promote economic development, especially for women. © 2022 Georgeou et al.

Digital Technologies Adoption and Economic Benefits in Agriculture: A Mixed-Methods Approach,"Governments globally aim to boost productivity and enhance farmers’ livelihoods, addressing challenges like climate change, food security, and labor shortages through digital technologies. However, adoption rates in developing countries remain low due to uncertainties regarding expected returns and obstacles stemming from subjective and objective factors among farmers. This study takes China as a case study to examine the internal and external factors influencing growers’ adoption intensity of digital technology and its impact on enhancing economic benefits, aiming to provide valuable insights for the promotion of digital technology in other countries and regions. This study employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative methodologies, utilizing data from Shandong and Liaoning provinces. The findings underscore the significant role of growers’ knowledge, technology compatibility, government support, and competitive pressure in driving the adoption of digital technology among growers, with male growers and those managing larger cultivation areas demonstrating higher adoption intensity. Digital technologies can enhance growers’ economic benefits by reducing labor and input costs, increasing yields, and improving quality, with a 30.4% increase in economic benefits for each unit increase in adoption intensity of digital technologies. Technology promoters can use these findings to enhance growers’ awareness, highlight the practical benefits, and offer agricultural socialized services to promote digital technology adoption. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Five main stakeholders in the study area were identified: government, farmers, enterprises, cooperatives, and middlemen. (2) Increasing farmers’ income is the common demand of most stakeholders in the study area, and this common demand has different effects on the behavioral responses of different stakeholders. (3) There are three types of mediating mechanisms in the study area: government + farmers mediating corn and mutton, government + enterprises mediating millet, and government + cooperatives mediating apples. On this basis, the effects of the different types of mediating mechanisms on variations in food yield, and trade-offs and synergies in typical townships, were analyzed. © 2021 by the authors.

Do natural resources lead to a curse or blessing in terms of income inequality?,"This study examines the effects of the revenues generated by the extraction of natural resource reserves on income distribution in countries with natural resource reserves. The theoretical underpinning is based on the view that natural resources, which are defined in the literature as the natural resources curse, cause many adverse macroeconomic and political effects on countries' natural resource discoveries and revenues from extracted natural resources. The study aims to investigate whether natural resources have adverse effects on income inequality for countries with higher revenues of natural resources and abundant natural resources. For this purpose, we perform estimations using the system GMM estimator for low-income, lower-middle-income and natural resources-rich countries in the period 2009–2019. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between natural resource rent and income inequality. In other words, natural resource rent has a cursing effect up to a threshold, then it has a blessing effect on income inequality. We also find an inverted U-shaped relationship between economic growth and income inequality. Additionally, the rule of law has a negative effect on income inequality. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
No wheat crisis: trade liberalization and transportation innovation in Quebec during the 1830s and 1840s,"In the first half of the nineteenth century, the wheat oriented agrarian economy of Lower Canada saw a rapid collapse in wheat production. These developments have been blamed on factors ranging from soil exhaustion to cultural conservatism and used to infer falling living standards in the colony. We provide evidence suggesting this collapse was largely the result of adjustment to the trade shock that followed the Colonial Trade Act of 1831 and a rapid reduction in freight costs between the Canadian colonies. Areas more exposed to external markets—as proxied by road access—shifted away from wheat production. © 2023 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Statogenic climate change? Julian Simon and Institutions,"Outside of economics (and even within), Julian Simon is mostly remembered for his famous bet on resource prices against biologist Paul Ehrlich. The bet is frequently used to illustrate how some environmental scares are exaggerated. In the rare instances when more details are added, the emphasis is always on how the role of innovation in promoting socio-economic progress which, directly or indirectly, solves environmental problems. However, Simon had a rich and complex view of the role of institutions in modulating the pace of socio-economic progress (broadly defined) and the extent of environmental problems. In this paper, I highlight the unappreciated institutional conditions that Simon placed in his work. Institutions that foiled or distorted the market process had, in Simon’s view, the dual effect of reducing living standards and amplifying environmental problems. I show, using the case of climate change, that Simon’s forgotten nuances can help explain modern environmental problems such as climate change. Most notably, it allows a subtle shift from claiming that climate change is anthropogenic (i.e. man-made) to claiming that climate change is “statogenic” (i.e. government-made). This emphasis on government-made pollution can be extended to numerous environmental problems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Sufficiency health-wise: sustainable paths towards planetary and public health,"Planet Earth is threatened by the human population. Energy and resource use are far beyond the planet’s carrying capacity. Planetary Health suggests an alternative idea of prosperity as the best possible human health for all within planetary boundaries. This implies giving priority to ecology because human health depends ultimately on the integrity of the global biosphere. This paper presents a Health Sufficiency Framework, based on the Doughnut Economics Model.

Evaluating the flood damage on dairy farms: A methodological proposal,"The debate on climate change arose several concerns on the impacts of floods on agriculture and, consequently, on food security. At the same time, the European Floods Directive asks Members States to implement suitable measures to mitigate flood damage on economic activities, including farms. Still, while several analyses were developed to estimate potential flood damages on crops, a gap exists for livestock productions. The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual model for the assessment of flood economic damages on dairy farms. Results propose a static and a dynamic model of farms recovery actions to re-establish the farming activity, which takes into account all farm components, as well as their interaction. Facing the destruction caused by floods, a first reaction of farmers could be closing the activity, with repercussion on this well-being as well as on farm workers', and on the economy of rural areas. From this perspective, this study wants to provide a first methodological pathway to support farmers in restoring their activity. © Firenze University Press.",Not About Sufficiency
Crop models and their use in assessing crop production and food security: A review,"Agriculture is directly related to food security as it determines the global food supply. Research in agriculture to predict crop productivity and losses helps avoid high food demand with little supply and price spikes. Here, we review ten crop models and one intercomparison project used for simulating crop growth and productivity under various impacts from soil–crop–atmosphere interactions. The review outlines food security and production assessments using numerical models for maize, wheat, and rice production. A summary of reviewed studies shows the following: (1) model ensembles provide smaller modeling errors compared to single models, (2) single models show better results when coupled with other types of models, (3) the ten reviewed crop models had improvements over the years and can accurately predict crop growth and yield for most of the locations, management conditions, and genotypes tested, (4) APSIM and DSSAT are fast and reliable in assessing broader output variables, (5) AquaCrop is indicated to investigate water footprint, quality and use efficiency in rainfed and irrigated systems, (6) all models assess nitrogen dynamics and use efficiency efficiently, excluding AquaCrop and WOFOST, (7) JULES specifies in evaluating food security vulnerability, (8) ORYZA is the main crop model used to evaluate paddy rice production, (9) grain filling is usually assessed with APSIM, DAISY, and DSSAT, and (10) the ten crop models can be used as tools to evaluate food production, availability, and security. © 2023 The Authors.

Deep-sea fisheries as resilient bioeconomic systems for food and nutrition security and sustainable development,"The frequent deterioration of coastal fisheries has resulted in a need to nourish the world's rapidly expanding population, contributing to a substantial shift toward fishing in the mesopelagic zone. These areas contain a potentially huge amount of fish biomass. Considering that the global population will demand an increase of 60% in food production by 2050, it appears that exploiting the mesopelagic resources is simply a question of time. The present paper reviews the major risks and opportunities related to the exploitation of mesopelagic fisheries. Due to the significance of the uncertainties related to the stock of fish resources, environmental and biodiversity effects of the deep-sea fisheries, this inquiry advocates for the enhancement of sustainable small-sized deep-sea fishery practices on the one hand side and a global moratorium on large-scale mesopelagic fishing on the other hand. Deep seas could provide substantial resources for combating global food insecurity and facilitate a substantial improvement of the nutritional status in the regions plagued by a high incidence of infant mortality and disproportional poverty headcount ratios. For the sake of global and regional food and nutrition security, the exploitation of the biological resources of the mesopelagic zone is a legitimate target, whereby environmental sustainability is the major precondition for the rollout of these kinds of fishing activities. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Compensating for environmental damages,"This paper examines a situation in which a decision-maker determines the appropriate compensation that should be awarded for a given amount of ecological damage. The compensation can take the form of either or both monetary and environmental units to meet three goals: i) minimisation of the cost associated with the compensation, ii) no aggregate welfare loss, and iii) minimal environmental compensation requirement. The findings suggest that - in some cases - providing both monetary and environmental compensation can be the cost-minimising option. Minimal compensation constraints can increase total compensation costs but reduce individual gains and losses relative to the initial situation that arise from heterogeneous tradeoffs between income and environmental quality. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

"Energy, environmental degradation, and health status: evidence from South Asia","Energy is considered a vital factor of economic growth that contributes to improve quality of life and health status. However, global warming, climate change, and environmental degradation are due primarily because of energy emissions, whereas environmental degradation is detrimental to health. Since one-fifth of the population lives in South Asia, it is necessary to analyze the impact of energy and environmental degradation on health status in this region. For this purpose, health status in South Asia is proxy with health expenditure, life expectancy, and infant mortality, and this study investigates the effect of energy intensity, income, and carbon emissions on health status, whereas urbanization is considered a control variable. The cointegration test indicates South Asia’s long-term health status factors are energy intensity, income, carbon emissions, and urbanization. Long-run results suggest that energy intensity and income improve health status as these factors reduce health expenditure, improve life expectancy, and decrease infant mortality. Environmental degradation not only increases health expenditure but also hinders life expectancy and increases mortality. Moreover, an increase in income diminishes health expenditure and is responsible for high life expectancy and low mortality in South Asia. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Industrial Districts in Europe: Lessons for Industrial Hubs and Industrialization,"Industrial districts (IDs) have developed in many regions and countries of Europe, especially in Italy and southern countries, since the end of the 1970s. This chapter underlines the emerging of this territorial model of development, remembering both the discovery of the phenomenon in European countries and the introduction of the debate and the progressive awareness of territories’ stakeholders and policymakers on the specific features and needs of this kind of organization’s model. Specific attention has been devoted to the transformation’s trajectories of IDs to avoid the risks of collapse. All this requires the capability to introduce active strategies and policies to reproduce dynamic competitive factors. A shared interpretation of the transformation’s process and prospects for IDs should be the basis for collective actions to maintain sustainable development.

Energy infrastructure in India: Profile and risks under climate change,"India has committed large investments to energy infrastructure assets-power plants, refineries, energy ports, pipelines, roads, railways, etc. The coastal infrastructure being developed to meet the rising energy imports is vulnerable to climate extremes. This paper provides an overview of climate risks to energy infrastructures in India and details two case studies - a crude oil importing port and a western coast railway transporting coal. The climate vulnerability of the port has been mapped using an index while that of the railway has been done through a damage function for RCP 4.5.0 and 8.5 scenarios. Our analysis shows that risk management through adaptation is likely to be very expensive. The system risks can be even greater and might adversely affect energy security and access objectives. Aligning sustainable development and climate adaptation measures can deliver substantial co-benefits. The key policy recommendations include: i) mandatory vulnerability assessment to future climate risks for energy infrastructures; ii) project and systemic risks in the vulnerability index; iii) adaptation funds for unmitigated climate risks; iv) continuous monitoring of climatic parameters and implementation of adaptation measures, and iv) sustainability actions along energy infrastructures that enhance climate resilience and simultaneously deliver co-benefits to local agents. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Exploring Natural–Social Impacts on the Complex Interactions of Ecosystem Services in Ecosystem Service Bundles,"Understanding intricate interactions between natural–social factors and ecosystem service synergies and trade-offs (ESS/EST) can be valuable for promoting the sustainable development of multiple ecosystem services (ESs). Taking Beijing as the study area, this study was conducted from the perspective of ecosystem service bundles (ESBs). First, based on the identification of key ecological risks, the supply of 5 ESs was quantified. Then, 3 ESBs were identified through the cluster analysis of the ESs. We explored the synergies and trade-offs between ES pairs in different ESBs and quantified their strengths. By further exploring the influence of natural–social factors on ESS/EST, we developed targeted management policies in different ESBs to improve management efficiency. At the township scale, Beijing is divided into 3 ESBs. Marked differences in the ESS/EST were found among each bundle, indicating the necessity of zonal management. The results showed that landscape composition was the dominant factor affecting ESS in ESB3 and EST in ESB2, human activities had the greatest influence on ESS in ESB2, while biophysical indicators had the highest degree of contribution to ESS and EST in ESB1 and EST in ESB3. These results support the formulation of sustainable management strategies. The results of the study emphasize the importance of considering ESS/EST and their natural–social factors in different ESBs when formulating effective policies, which can provide useful guidance for sustainable urban planning and development and can be further applied to metropolitan areas around the world. © 2024 Jingran Gao et al.",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of climate change policy on the risk of water stress in southern and eastern Asia,"The adequacy of freshwater resources remains a critical challenge for a sustainable and growing society. We present a self-consistent risk-based assessment of water availability and use under future climate change and socioeconomic growth by midcentury across southern and eastern Asia (SEA). We employ large ensemble scenarios from an integrated modeling framework that are consistent across the spectrum of regional climate, population, and economic projections. We find socioeconomic growth contributes to an increase in water stress across the entire ensemble. However, climate change drives the ensemble central tendency toward an increase in water stress in China but a reduction in India, with a considerable spread across the ensemble. Nevertheless, the most deleterious unabated climate-change impact is a low probability but salient extreme increase in water stress over China and India. In these outcomes, annual withdrawals will routinely exceed water-storage capacity. A modest greenhouse gas mitigation pathway eliminates the likelihood of these extreme outcomes and also benefits hundreds of millions of people at risk to various levels of water stress increase. Over SEA we estimate an additional 200 million people under threat of facing at least heavily water-stressed conditions from climate change and socioeconomic growth, but the mitigation scenario reduces the additional population-under-threat by 30% (60 million). Nevertheless, there remains a 1-in-2 chance that 100 million people across SEA experience a 50% increase in water stress and a 1-in-10 chance they experience a doubling of water stress. Therefore, widespread adaptive measures may be required over the coming decades to meet these unavoidable risks in water shortfalls. © 2018 The Author(s).

Impact of dyeing industrial pollution on farm income and production intiruppur district of Tamil Nadu,"India targeted to achieve 3-4 per cent growth per annum in agricultural sector and to produce 400 million tonnes offoodgrains by 2020. To achieve this target the strategies of the green revolution are not valid. The high usage of fertilisers and chemicals did not increase the productivity of agriculture. They had caused environmental degradation. Hence, there is a need to identify new strategies to achieve the goals. Environmental degradation is one of the most pronounced problems in agriculture. The industrial pollution is a major cause of environmental degradation. The growing industries had aggravated the problems ofenvironmental degradation in agriculture. Hence, the policies which promote sustainable agriculture, in terms of food security, rural employment and environmentally sustainable technologies are needed. The findings of the study showed that all the farmers (cent per cent) had responded thatthe dumping of industrial waste was the major cause of industrial pollution in agriculture. The quality of land was completely eroded and the crops were burnt due to dyeing industrial pollution. It was not able to use for drinking water of the farmers and livestock. If one additional farmer had cultivated in an area polluted industries, the farm income had reduced to the extent of 3,24,644.196.

Global governance for pandemic prevention and the wildlife trade,"Although ideas about preventive actions for pandemics have been advanced during the COVID-19 crisis, there has been little consideration for how they can be operationalised through governance structures within the context of the wildlife trade for human consumption. To date, pandemic governance has mostly focused on outbreak surveillance, containment, and response rather than on avoiding zoonotic spillovers in the first place. However, given the acceleration of globalisation, a paradigm shift towards prevention of zoonotic spillovers is warranted as containment of outbreaks becomes unfeasible. Here, we consider the current institutional landscape for pandemic prevention in light of ongoing negotiations of a so-called pandemic treaty and how prevention of zoonotic spillovers from the wildlife trade for human consumption could be incorporated. We argue that such an institutional arrangement should be explicit about zoonotic spillover prevention and focus on improving coordination across four policy domains, namely public health, biodiversity conservation, food security, and trade. We posit that this pandemic treaty should include four interacting goals in relation to prevention of zoonotic spillovers from the wildlife trade for human consumption: risk understanding, risk assessment, risk reduction, and enabling funding. Despite the need to keep political attention on addressing the current pandemic, society cannot afford to miss the opportunity of the current crisis to encourage institution building for preventing future pandemics. © 2023 The Author(s).

Resilience-based steps for adaptive co-management of Arctic small-scale fisheries,"Arctic small-scale fisheries are essential for the livelihoods, cultures, nutrition, economy, and food security of Indigenous communities. Their sustainable management in the rapidly changing Arctic is thus a key priority. Fisheries management in complex systems such as the Arctic would benefit from integrative approaches that explicitly seek to build resilience. Yet, resilience is rarely articulated as an explicit goal of Arctic fisheries management. Here, we first describe how marine and anadromous fisheries management throughout the North has used the notion of resilience through a literature review of 72 peer-reviewed articles. Second, we make a conceptual contribution in the form of steps to implement adaptive co-management that aim to foster resilience. Building on resilience-based insights from the literature review and foundational research on adaptive co-management and resilience, the steps we propose are to initiate and carry out (1) dialogue through a discussion forum, (2) place-based social-ecological participatory research, (3) resilience-building management actions, (4) collaborative monitoring, and (5) joint process evaluation. Additionally, we propose action items associated with the steps to put adaptive co-management into practice. Third, we assess two case studies, Cambridge Bay and Pangnirtung Arctic Char commercial fisheries, to explore how the five steps can help reinforce resilience through adaptive co-management. Overall, we propose novel guidelines for implementing adaptive co-management that actively seeks to build resilience within fishery social-ecological systems in times of rapid, uncertain, and complex environmental change. © 2022 The Author(s).

"Of rivers, fish and poison","Every one of the diverse ecosystems of the Indian subcontinent is being degraded to some measure; but it is the freshwater ecosystems that are under the greatest threat. The root causes of this degradation lie in human institutions, in the inequities that plague our society. A significant number of our people depend directly on natural resources for their livelihoods. These ""ecosystem people"", however, have little control over the resource base. Instead the patterns of natural resource use are dictated by an ""Iron triangle"" of urban population, industry and large landholders who are the beneficiaries of the supply of a variety of natural resources at highly subsidized rates, the politicians who decide as to who gets what subsidies and the administrators who implement them. Insulated from the effects of resource depletion, these constituents of the iron triangle promote exhaustive patterns of natural resource use whose adverse consequences are felt primarily by the rural landless, small-holders, artisans, herders, tribais, and fisherfolk. It is these ecosystem people who have a far greater stake in a healthy environment, and their empowerment and involvement holds the promise of eventually slowing down a continuing meltdown of our ecosystems. India's Biological Diversity Act is a welcome move towards engaging and empowering these people. The Biodiversity Management Committees that are being established under this act in all panchayat raj institutions and town and city municipalities would be engaged in documenting local ecosystems in the form of ""People's Biodiversity Registers"". Biodiversity Management Committee study groups comprising interested BMC members, students, and teachers from colleges/ high schools, volunteers from CBOs, NGOs, and knowledgeable individuals representing different stakeholder groups would carry out this task. This exercise would focus on the documentation of people-natural resource links, landscape/ waterscape of the study area, local biodiversity elements, people's knowledge associated with biodiversity, and people's perspectives on management issues, culminating in the formulation of a management plan to support the functioning of the local Biodiversity Management Committee. A pilot exercise on the preparation of People's Biodiversity Registers was conducted in Mendha (Lekha), a primarily tribal village of eastern Maharashtra. This village is notable for many community level initiatives towards sustainable management of natural resources. We report here the components of the People's Biodiversity Registers exercise focusing on perhaps the most threatened of our ecosystems, namely the freshwater bodies. The major aquatic habitat of the locality is the Kathani river. It is fished by Dhivars, a community of specialist fisherfolk and Gonds who primarily fish for self consumption, and who participated in this study along with local students, teachers and scientists from the Indian Institute of Science. The study involved catching and releasing back to the river 1508 individuals through 146 fishing events. This sample comprised 32 species of 24 genera. Gonds reported 43 distinct fish names, while Dhivars reported 63. The total number expected to comprise the pool of species from which the sample was drawn is 64. About 70% of the fish species are reported to be declining, 5 species including Anguilla bengalensis are reported to have gone locally extinct, while 4 new species, primarily ""Invasive Aliens"" like Tilapia are reported to have appeared newly. The study led to an in-depth understanding of the diversity of factors responsible for habitat destruction and fish population depletion, including insights such as the possible impact of ash generated by forest fires. The people already possess a variety of traditional conservation practices such as protection to sacred river stretches and species. To this, prompted by the study, people have added banning of use of all poison, herbal and synthetic, for fishing in Kathani river. This ban is applicable to a cluster or Ilakha of 32 villages including Mendha (Lekha) and has been effectively implemented for the past three years. © National Institute of Ecology, New Delhi.",Not About Sufficiency
"How inequitable is the global distribution of responsibility, capability, and vulnerability to climate change: A comprehensive indicator-based assessment","While it is generally asserted that those countries who have contributed least to anthropogenic climate change are most vulnerable to its adverse impacts some recently developed indices of vulnerability to climate change come to a different conclusion. Confirmation or rejection of this assertion is complicated by the lack of an agreed metric for measuring countries' vulnerability to climate change and by conflicting interpretations of vulnerability. This paper presents a comprehensive semi-quantitative analysis of the disparity between countries' responsibility for climate change, their capability to act and assist, and their vulnerability to climate change for four climate-sensitive sectors based on a broad range of disaggregated vulnerability indicators. This analysis finds a double inequity between responsibility and capability on the one hand and the vulnerability of food security, human health, and coastal populations on the other. This double inequity is robust across alternative indicator choices and interpretations of vulnerability. The main cause for the higher vulnerability of poor nations who have generally contributed little to climate change is their lower adaptive capacity. In addition, the biophysical sensitivity and socio-economic exposure of poor nations to climate impacts on food security and human health generally exceeds that of wealthier nations. No definite statement can be made on the inequity associated with climate impacts on water supply due to large uncertainties about future changes in regional water availability and to conflicting indicators of current water scarcity. The robust double inequity between responsibility and vulnerability for most climate-sensitive sectors strengthens the moral case for financial and technical assistance from those countries most responsible for climate change to those countries most vulnerable to its adverse impacts. However, the complex and geographically heterogeneous patterns of vulnerability factors for different climate-sensitive sectors suggest that the allocation of international adaptation funds to developing countries should be guided by sector-specific or hazard-specific criteria despite repeated requests from participants in international climate negotiations to develop a generic index of countries' vulnerability to climate change. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Policy sequencing to reduce tropical deforestation,"Non-technical summary Tropical deforestation continues apace despite a proliferation of commitments made by companies and governments to control it. Halting and reversing deforestation requires multiple, complementary interventions by state and non-state actors at different scales. We argue that the order in which these instruments and actors are introduced into the policy mix matters. Sequences of interventions from case studies in Latin America show that government commitment is a critical first step, implemented through command-and-control measures and then incentives. Combined with REDD+, they create an enabling environment for supply chain initiatives. A more coordinated and deliberate polycentric governance is needed to achieve zero-deforestation. Technical summary Avoided deforestation provides a natural climate solution for reducing emissions while generating co-benefits for people and nature. However, unleashing this potential requires improved governance. Diverse coalitions of actors are designing interventions to protect forests, each with different motivations and specialization of strategies. We introduce a policy sequencing framework to advance our understanding of how to improve polycentric zero-deforestation governance. Focusing on commodity production in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Colombia, we reconstructed the policy mix of zero-deforestation interventions across three domains - domestic public policies, REDD+, and supply chain initiatives. We classified interventions according to their instrument mechanism - disincentives, incentives, enabling measures - and when they were introduced into the policy mix. We found a sequence of interventions that reflects stages of forest cover dynamics, but also depends on local political will and institutional capacity. Government command-and-control measures are needed early in the policy sequence to slow deforestation, with incentives added to increase legal compliance. REDD+ helps governments build an enabling environment that supports supply chain initiatives seeking to increase forest cover at later stages of the sequence. Policy sequencing and policyscape concepts advance the design of more deliberate polycentric forest governance that enhances actor coordination and instrument synergies in the policy mix.

The principle of affected interests: An interpretation and defense,"Many chapters in this book focus on the proper relationship between citizens and their government: Problems of inclusion, equality, political opportunity, political expression, representation, and responsiveness. But even if we managed to p|erfect the processes connecting citizens to their state, democratic ambitions would remain unsatisfied in light of the circumstances of twenty-first-century governance. The actions of many organizations-private corporations, nongovernmental organizations, and other states would still redound on citizens, and those citizens would have little influence over the actions of those organizations. For this reason, democratic theorists should expand their sights beyond the state to encompass those other organizations that affect citizens and the ordering of social life more broadly. This chapter develops the principle of affected interests as a normative democratic foundation to guide that expansion. The question of inclusion in democratic theory has focused largely upon the relationship of citizens to their state. Theorists have sought to provide an account of the political rights of individuals living under the legitimate authority of a democratic government. These accounts seek to ground the judgment that adult citizens living under such authority should be treated as equals who have, among other liberties, rights to participate in the decisions of that state. Two starting points lead to this end of equal citizenship in a state that is legitimate because it is democratic. The first is the principle of popular sovereignty. This principle frequently emerges from contractarian and constitutionalist reasoning. Historically and philosophically, a democracy of equal citizens is the answer to the question of how a collection of individuals who expect to live with one another in a society should organize their common affairs. Effective organization requires authority. Authority resides in the territorial state and takes the form of laws that impose obligations of obedience upon citizens. To be acceptable to the citizens whom they obligate, laws must be made democratically: by citizens themselves as political equals. From the principle of popular sovereignty, a legitimate order is a ""self-legislating demos, of citizens ruling and being ruled in turn, consisting of all and only those who are full citizens and thus both authors and subjects of the law"" (Bohman 2007, emphasis original). A second starting point begins with the principle of affected interests (see Mill 1991 (1861); Dahl 1989: 93-95, 119-31; Goodin 2007). That principle, perhaps the most basic of democratic intuitions, is that individuals should be able to influence decisions that affect them. Absent such influence, decisions may be taken in ways that do not properly regard the interests of those they affect. Furthermore, exercising such influence is a critical aspect of individual autonomy. This chapter aims to articulate a plausible formulation of the principle of affected interests that has three main features. First, we should interpret the principle as applying not only to legislatures but also to administrative agencies, private corporations, civic organizations, and governments of other societies. Second, we should interpret the principle in a continuing, regulative way. That is, the principle of affected interests does not establish a boundary of inclusion once and for all. It guides the adjustment of boundaries of inclusion and standing as the effects of the decisions of various organizations ebb and flow. Finally, we should understand the term ""influence"" in the principle to include not just direct influence of a participatory democratic kind, but also indirect (e.g., delegated) and passive (e.g., structural or cultural) kinds of influence. This formulation addresses some important objections to the principle of affected interests such as incoherence, regress, and impracticality. Those who begin from each of these different starting points-popular sovereignty and affected interests-have for the most part converged upon the state as their main focus in democratic theory. From the principle of popular sovereignty, individuals have a special relationship to their state because it alone commands them. Citizens come together as equals and rule themselves through their state. Within any territory, the state makes the binding decisions for the territory as a whole that are backed by coercive power. Constitutional democracy is the answer to the question of why citizens should regard such binding decisions as legitimate and authoritative. From the perspective of the principle of affected interest, the actions of states usually have the most potent effects on individuals' most important interests. At the extreme, states send their citizens to war, imprison them, and even execute them. More commonly, government actions and public policies affect the security, prosperity, and overall well-being of individuals. Territorially organized representative government in which citizens are political equals provides the normative ideal that justifies an ongoing structure through which citizens can shape laws to protect their interests. For all of these reasons, states and their laws have been and will properly remain an important object of political philosophy. However, scholars in many areas of social investigation and practice-in political science, sociology, and public policy-point out that contemporary conditions have constrained the reach and capability of formal state structures (Nye and Keohane 2000; Bohman 2007). Sites of power and influence have proliferated, even as the states ability to bridle them has diminished. Either the state is less capable today of ordering the affairs of its citizens, or we have expected too much of the state in organizing our complex interdependen- cies. In either case, the actions and consequences of other states, corporations, nongovernmental organizations, public agencies, and even individual citizens now escape, perhaps inevitably and irrevocably, the regulatory control of democratically directed governments. A broad ebb of the state as the principal actor in organizing common affairs and accomplishing public objectives is now widely called the shift from government to governance. The term governance denotes activities that, like projects of government, aim to achieve common purposes. However, the new term is meant to mark changes in both who acts to achieve those purposes and how they are achieved. With regard to means, public leaders and policy makers now frequently rely less on state commands and more on efforts to ""steer"" the behavior of actors in society. They also rely on collaborations that include actors outside of government. With regard to who acts, governance activities are undertaken by entities not only in the state sector but also in the private sector and civil society (Nye and Keohane 2000). In global climate change, economic development, human rights protection, basic education, disaster relief, and many other issues, the most promising strategies consist not of states making binding laws but rather of complex governance activities that involve collaborations between government and nongovernmental actors. Whether or not this shift from government to governance is truly novel, it suggests that states acting through laws can fulfill neither the aim of popular sovereignty-to direct supreme authority according to the will of the people-nor the aim of the principle of affected interests. Rules of inclusion that provide equal opportunities for the participation of citizens in decisions of their state then become insufficient for either understanding of democracy. From the perspective of popular sovereignty, enfranchisement in state decision-making is insufficient for self-rule, when many important decisions that order the common affairs of citizens are made by non-state actors or at levels above or below that of the nation. For the proponent of the affected-interests principle, individuals should be able to exercise influence over a range of decisions broader than those made by the state when such decisions affect their important interests. From both perspectives, the shift from government to governance demands an expanded account of democratic inclusion in which individuals influence not just state decisions, but the decisions of other organizations as well. In this chapter, I develop the principle of affected interests to offer an account of inclusion appropriate for the contemporary circumstance of gov-ernance. The principle of affected interests strikes me as the most promising for grappling with the challenges of contemporary governance. Popular sovereignty, especially in its common contractarian and constitutional forms, begins by delineating a group of individuals-the demos-who form a per-sistent political community.3 But one feature of governance is that different problems encircle quite different groups of individuals. From the perspective of affected interests, very different sets of individuals should exercise influence over decisions concerning global climate change, health care pol-icy, local education, and international labor conditions. It may in fact be fruitful to think of the principles of affected interests and popular sovereignty as complementary, rather than exclusive and opposed, justifications of democracy. 4 Both have their place in the political culture of democratic societies and the justification of democratic institutions and practices, our commitments to representative governments of territorial nation-states through which we rule ourselves as free and equal citizens.

Wild relatives of potato may bolster its adaptation to new niches under future climate scenarios,"Food production strategies and patterns are being altered in response to climate change. Enhancing the adaptation of important food crops to novel climate regimes will be critical to maintaining world food supplies. Climate change is altering the suitability of production areas for crops such as potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) making future productivity, resilience, and sustainability of this crop dependent on breeding for climate adaptation, including through the introgression of novel traits from its wild relatives. To better understand the future production climate envelopes of potatoes, and the potential of its wild relatives to contribute to adaptation to these environments, we estimated the climate of potato in four future climate scenarios and overlapped the current climate of 72 wild relative species and potato with these future climates. We discovered a shift of up to 12.5% by potato from current to novel climate by 2070 and varying magnitudes of overlap by different wild relatives with potato, primarily driven by the extent of endemism. To address the threat of novel climate on potato production and with the wealth of data available for the agrobiodiversity in potato wild relatives, we systematically developed a prioritization value inspired by the logic of the breeder's equation for locating potentially beneficial species possessing local adaptability, climatic plasticity, and interspecific crossability. In doing so, 26 unique species by discrete climate combinations are found, highlighting the presence of unique species to use in adapting potato to changing local climates. Further, the 20 highest prioritized values belong to diploid species, enforcing the drive to shift into diploid breeding by the potato research community, where introgression of the local climate adaptability traits may be more streamlined. © 2022 The Authors.

"Economic growth, convergence, and world food demand and supply","In recent years, developing countries have been growing much more rapidly than the industrial countries. This growth convergence has potentially very important implications for world food demand and for world agriculture because of the increase in demand for agricultural resources as diets shift away from starchy staples and towards animal-based products and fruits and vegetables. Using a resource-based measure of food production and consumption that accounts for the much higher production costs associated with animal-based foods, this article finds per capita demand growth to be a more important driver of food demand than population growth between now and 2050. Using the middle-ground Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenario to 2050 from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, which assumes continued income convergence, the article finds that the increase in food demand (102 percent) would be about a third greater than under a hypothetical scenario of all countries growing at the same rate (78 percent). As convergence increases the growth of food supply by less than demand, it appears to be a driver of upward pressure on world food prices. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring associations between state education initiatives and teachers’ sleep: A social-ecological approach,"Social policies that are not specifically aimed at impacting health can still have health consequences. State education reforms, such as standardized testing and stringent accountability for schools and teachers, may affect teacher health by changing their working conditions. This study explores associations between state education initiatives and teachers’ sleep, an important predictor of productivity and chronic health conditions. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2013 and 2014 data sets provided sleep and demographic data for 7836 teachers in 29 states in the United States. We linked the teacher data to state education reform data from the U.S. Department of Education. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of reporting inadequate sleep (i.e., <6.5 h and <5.5 h) associated with state education policies after adjusting for demographic characteristics. Teachers had significantly higher odds of reporting inadequate sleep if their state financed professional development, sanctioned or rewarded schools based on student performance, and regulated classroom materials for state-wide common core standards (ORs ranging from 1.25 to 1.84). More strictly defined inadequate sleep (<5.5 h) had generally higher ORs than less strict definition (<6.5 h). The Race-to-the-Top award, a US federal grant designed to encourage states to implement reforms through regulations and legislations, was also associated with inadequate sleep (OR = 1.41, p < 0.01, for <6.5 h; OR = 1.55, p < 0.01, for <5.5 h). Although this exploratory study did not have district- and school-level implementation data, the results suggest that some state education policies may have impacts on teacher sleep. Consequences of education reform for teacher health deserve more attention. © 2017",Not About Sufficiency
Potential side effects of climate change mitigation on poverty and countermeasures,"Many countries have set ambitious long-term emissions reduction targets for reaching the goal in alignment with the Paris Agreement. However, large-scale emission reduction efforts may influence poverty by various economic channels. Here, we show the extent to which climate change mitigation, excluding climate change impacts, has the potential to increase poverty, and have identified its factors such as income, price changes, and direct and indirect carbon pricing impacts. We found that the global poverty headcount could increase by 69 million (19%) in 2030 relative to the baseline for climate change mitigation with global uniform carbon prices. Moreover, our decomposition analysis revealed that both price and income change effects were major factors that could increase the poverty headcount, which are 55% and 40%, respectively. This adverse side effect could be mitigated by various measures, such as emission regulations and an enhancement of energy efficiency standards beyond the typical simple carbon tax. Our results imply that global climate change mitigation policy should place more attention on economic development in poor countries. © 2023, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Spatial and Temporal Distribution and the Driving Factors of Carbon Emissions from Urban Production Energy Consumption,"Urban production energy consumption produces a large amount of carbon emissions, which is an important source of global warming. This study measures the quantity and intensity of carbon emissions in 30 provinces of China based on urban production energy consumption from 2005–2019, and uses the Dagum Gini coefficient, kernel density estimation, carbon emission classification and spatial econometric model to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution and driving factors of quantity and intensity of carbon emissions from China and regional production energy consumption. It was found that the growth rate of carbon emission quantity and carbon emission intensity of production energy consumption decreased year by year in each province during the study period. The imbalance of carbon emission was strong, with different degrees of increase and decrease, and there were big differences between eastern and western regions. The classification of carbon emissions differed among provinces and there was heterogeneity among regions. The quantity and intensity of carbon emissions of production energy consumption qwre affected by multiple factors, such as industrial structure. This study provides an in-depth comparison of the spatial and temporal distribution and driving factors of quantity and intensity of carbon emissions of production energy consumption across the country and regions, and provides targeted policies for carbon emission reduction across the country and regions, so as to help achieve China’s “double carbon” target quickly and effectively. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploration of public stereotypes of supply-and-demand characteristics of recycled water infrastructure - Evidence from an event-related potential experiment in Xi'an, China","There is a growing consensus that recycled water, as an alternative and renewable water source, can serve as a vital water supply to alleviate water scarcity problem and in support of water resilience. Accordingly, recycled water infrastructure investment has seen a significant growth in recent years in many regions of the world. However, previous studies found the perceptions of public, the main end user, toward using recycled water for potable or non-potable purposes remain negatively stereotyped. The negative stereotypes led to public rejections to the construction and operation of recycled water infrastructure. Traditionally, public perceptions of recycled water uses are captured through self-reporting interview or survey techniques. To gain a more accurate measurement of the implicit public stereotypes toward recycled water uses, this study employed an event-related potential (ERPs) technique to collect neurophysiological responses with participants and presented a few research findings. Firstly, the negative stereotypes of recycled water still exist. Secondly, the degree of human contact impacts the negative stereotypes of participants toward recycled water uses more significantly on the supply side (referring to the whole supply chain of recycled water) rather than on the demand side (referring to the potential consumers of recycled water) Third, knowledge level significantly impacts the negative stereotypes of participants toward recycled water uses that have close human contact, at both supply and demand sides, and shows a more significant impact on the supply side. The findings of study contributed to the literature through creatively dividing the negative stereotypes of recycled water into the “supply-side” and the “demand-side” ones, and meanwhile have managerial implication for policymaking and scheme implementation in the area. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Invasive annual grasses destabilize plant communities in a northern mixed-grass prairie,"Temporal community stability, here defined as temporal mean divided by temporal SD, plays an important role in predicting certain ecosystem services. However, temporal stability can change with invasion, with greater abundances of invasive species potentially having greater impacts on native community stability. The exact consequences of invasion for temporal stability are unclear and, in part, depend on the particular metric of stability measured. In rangeland ecosystems, predicable forage is important for livestock production but can be threatened by invasion. Therefore, using an observational field study conducted over three years in Wyoming, we assessed which metrics of plant community stability were altered by invasion and whether those effects were mediated by two environmental variables (light and soil moisture). Bromus arvensis and Bromus tectorum are two invasive annual weeds found across US rangelands, including the northern mixed-grass prairies of Wyoming. We established plots along natural invasion blocks of B. arvensis and B. tectorum abundance and collected plant species composition data over three growing seasons. We tested associations between seven different metrics of plant community stability and invasion by B. arvensis and B. tectorum. We found that species turnover increases with invasion by both species, while stability of forb (both brome species), C4 grass (B. arvensis only), and C3 grass (B. tectorum only) cover decreases with invasion. All metrics of stability associated with invasion supported the hypothesis of a destabilizing effect of invasion on the native plant community. Further, we found that light and soil moisture did mediate some associations between stability and invasion. Overall, our results align with previous work suggesting that invasive annual bromes can lead to decreased native plant stability, which has important implications for forage production and, thus, food security. © 2024 The Author(s).

A spatially explicit assessment of water use by the global semiconductor industry,"The semiconductor industry utilizes vast freshwater resources for its high-tech manufacturing processes. This work will enumerate the impact of the global semiconductor manufacturing industry on water resources. A global inventory of semiconductor manufacturing capacity, in combination with an approximation of water use required to manufacture an individual semiconductor chip, will be used to estimate water consumption by each semiconductor fabrication facility and globally. A simplified water stress assessment will be conducted by multiplying facility water use data by a water scarcity factor. Maps of the scarcity weighted water use will be used to identify watersheds that may be disproportionately impacted by semiconductor manufacturing water use. This may be especially important for regions of growth in the semiconductor industry such as China and Southeast Asia. Once these areas have been identified a detailed water footprint for the facilities located in the subwatershed of interest can be conducted. © 2017 IEEE.",Not About Sufficiency
"Status, challenges and pathways to the sustainable use of wild species","The use of wild species is extensive in both high- and low-income countries. At least 50,000 wild species are used by billions of people around the world for food, energy, medicine, material, education or recreation, contributing significantly to efforts to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, overexploitation remains a major threat to many wild species. Ensuring and enhancing the sustainability of use of wild species is thus essential for human well-being and biodiversity conservation. Globally, the use of wild species is increasing due to growing human demand and efficiency, but its sustainability varies and depends on the social-ecological contexts in which the use occurs. Multiple environmental and social (including economic) drivers affect the sustainability of use of wild species, posing major current and future challenges. In particular, climate change has already increased the vulnerability of many uses and is expected to increase it further in the coming decades, while global and illegal trades are, in many cases, key drivers of unsustainability. There is no single “silver bullet” policy to address these and other major challenges in the sustainable use of wild species. Rather, effective policies need to integrate inclusive actions at multiple scales that adopt right-based approaches, pay attention to equitable distribution of access and costs and benefits, employ participatory processes, strengthen monitoring programs, build robust customary or government institutions and support context-specific policies, as well as adaptive management. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Pathways to Achieving Low Energy-Poverty Problems in Central African Nations with Government Effectiveness, Technology, Natural Resources and Sustainable Economic Growth","Central African nations, just like other African nations, have serious energy poverty problems, both in the rural and urban settings. With increased energy-accessibility problems, citizens have resorted to the use of conventional fuels, causing severe environmental degradation and affecting the health systems due to pollution. In this study, we address how energy poverty is alleviated with technology, natural resources and improved institutional quality. The interplay between these factors in improving energy accessibility is not widely understood; hence, key policies are lacking in the field. The data of Central African nations for the time period from 2004 to 2021 are utilized. The data are also analyzed with the ‘Methods of Moments Quantile Regression’ technique, ensuring the correction of ‘cross-sectional dependence’ and ‘heterogeneity’ that exists. The key findings depict that natural resource rent, government effectiveness and technology help in lowering energy poverty in Central African nations. Economic growth increases energy poverty, while green finance and foreign direct investment do not present a significant effect on energy poverty. Therefore, natural resources are a blessing in improving the accessibility of energy in this region, and this is also made possible with advancements in sustainable technology and proper institutional quality. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

An independent review and accountability mechanism for the sustainable development goals: The possibilities of a framework convention on global health,"The Framework Convention on Global Health (FCGH), a proposed global treaty to be rooted in the right to health and aimed at health equity, could establish a nuanced, layered, and multi-faceted regime of compliance with, and accountability to, the right to health. In so doing, it would significantly strengthen accountability for the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which it would encompass. Legally binding, the FCGH could facilitate accountability through the courts and catalyze comprehensive domestic accountability regimes, requiring national strategies that include transparency, community and national mechanisms for accountability and participation and an enabling environment for social empowerment. A “Right to Health Capacity Fund” could ensure resources to implement these strategies. Inclusive national processes could establish targets, benchmarks, and indicators consistent with FCGH guidance, with regular reporting to a treaty body, which could also hear individual cases. State reports could be required to include plans to overcome implementation gaps, subjecting poorly complying states to penalties and targeted capacity building measures. Regional special rapporteurs could facilitate compliance through regular country visits, while also responding to serious violations. And reaching beyond government compliance, from capacity building to the courts and contractual obligations, the FCGH could establish nationally enforceable right to health obligations on the private sector. © Friedman.",Not About Sufficiency
An integrated biophysical and ecosystem approach as a base for ecosystem services analysis across regions,"In an interconnected world, the ‘food system’ sustainability of any given region is increasingly dependent on ecosystem services originated from supporting regions in different parts of the world. However, commonly used research approaches, such as place based ecosystem service assessments and interregional biophysical accounting, have limited capacity to capture the complex interactions across regions. This research addresses this gap by integrating a global biophysical accounting of food crops with its related local ecosystem dis-services. It combines agricultural and ecosystem indicators to describe different classes of biophysical pressures and potential dis-services from growing 4 key agricultural staples exported to Israel from different agricultural areas around the world. Each class stands as a ‘functional region’ in which either a trade-off or a synergy exists between agricultural efficiency and environmental impact. The research finds that over half of Israel's crops supply was produced in areas with high soil loss potential, and almost 15% of it originates from areas with high water scarcity. It implies that changes to Israel's supply sources have the potential to reduce consumption related impacts on ecosystem services. The functional regions typology may be used as a global road map mediating interregional flows assessments with place-based ecosystem service assessments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Public Health Literacy Defined,"Public health literacy is an emerging concept necessary to understand and address the broad array of factors, such as climate change, globalization, and poverty, that influence the public's health. Whereas health literacy has traditionally been operationalized as an individual-level construct, public health literacy takes into account the complex social, ecologic, and systemic forces affecting health and well-being. However, public health literacy has not yet been fully articulated. This paper addresses this gap by outlining a broad, new definition of public health literacy. This definition was developed through an inductive analytic process conducted in 2007 by a multidisciplinary research team, and two expert-panel sessions were convened to assess the consensual validity of the emergent definition. Based on this process, public health literacy is defined as the degree to which individuals and groups can obtain, process, understand, evaluate, and act on information needed to make public health decisions that benefit the community. Three dimensions of public health literacy-conceptual foundations, critical skills, and civic orientation-and related competencies are also proposed. Public health literacy is distinct from individual-level health literacy, and together, the two types of literacy form a more comprehensive model of health literacy. A five-part agenda is offered for future research and action aimed at increasing levels of public health literacy. © 2009 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental policy in majoritarian systems,"This paper sheds new light on the determination of environmental tax policies in majoritarian federal electoral systems, such as the U.S., and derives implications for the environmental federalism debate on whether the national or local government should have authority over environmental taxes. In the absence of majority bias, the socially preferred policy would be federal district-level taxation which accounts both for cross-boundary pollution and differences in industry concentration across districts. In majoritarian systems, however, where the legislature consists of geographically distinct electoral districts, the majority party (at the national or state level) favors home districts; depending on the location of polluting industries and the associated damages, the majority party may therefore impose sub-optimally high or low pollution taxes due to a majority bias. Majority bias can influence the social-welfare ranking of alternative environmental tax policies. In some cases, majority bias may make decentralized or federal uniform taxation the preferred solution. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Greening the Workforce: A Feminist Perspective,"This paper argues that there is a risk that policy proposals for a ‘greener workforce’ will replicate current gendered inequalities. Some ‘Just Transition’ frameworks for addressing workers’ concerns about a green economy expressly focus on male-dominated sectors. Others, while recognizing the need to include women, fail to identify or counteract the patriarchal power relations which drive inequality. Part I demonstrates the extent to which some of the most prominent Just Transition frameworks are dominated by a male norm. Part II examines how the dominance of the male norm can be confronted and addressed. Simply referring to gender equality is not sufficient. Instead, Just Transition frameworks should be scrutinized under the lens of a conception of substantive gender equality based on four dimensions: redressing disadvantage; addressing stigma, stereotyping, prejudice and violence; facilitating participation; and achieving structural change. Part III uses the four-dimensional framework of gendered substantive equality to point a way towards a future reconstruction of the labour force that can incorporate values that are both green and feminist. Part IV turns to women’s role in bringing about change and argues that to truly engender Just Transition frameworks, participation should avoid essentializing women and instead be based on collective and grass-roots organization. © 2023 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.

"Self-governance mediates small-scale fishing strategies, vulnerability and adaptive response","As global change accelerates, natural resource-dependent communities must respond and adapt. Small-scale fisheries, essential for coastal livelihoods and food security, are considered among the most vulnerable of these coupled social-ecological systems. While previous studies have examined vulnerability and adaptation in fisheries at the individual, household, and community level, these scales of organization are inconsistent with many of the legal and regulatory frameworks that function in practice to mediate behavior, decision-making, and adaptation. Here, we use cooperative- and privately-owned fishing enterprises in Northwest Mexico as a case study to examine how different forms of marine self-governance experience and respond to climate shocks. Leveraging social-ecological network methods to examine changes in fisheries participation and vulnerability during a recent period of pronounced regional oceanographic change, our analysis suggests that: 1) different forms of SSF self-governance (and the fishing strategies and harvest portfolios with which they are associated) help determine the impacts of and response to environmental change; and 2) that there may be important trade-offs between short-term responses which function to prevent or mitigate lost fishing revenue and long-term changes in climate vulnerability. In particular large fishing cooperatives, predicted to be highly vulnerable on the basis of network theoretic metrics, exceeded expectations (maintaining or increasing resource revenues) while demonstrating a degree of path dependency that may function to increase sensitivity and undermine resilience as climate change progresses. In providing an empirical evaluation of how self-governance arrangements characterized by different group sizes, access regimes and levels of cooperation respond to system perturbation, we aim to advance common pool resource theory while offering targeted guidance for the development of more nuanced and equitable climate adaptation policies. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency

Social-Ecological Spatial Analysis of Agroforestry in the European Union with a Focus on Mediterranean Countries,"Agroforestry has a long history of evolution in Europe and has been especially selected under the unfavorable socioeconomic and environmental conditions of the Mediterranean region. The recent changes in social-ecological conditions have increased the interest in the contribution of agroforestry to the mitigation of forthcoming challenges. Thus, the present study aimed to analyze the socioeconomic and ecological suitability of agricultural lands for preserving, restoring, and establishing agroforestry practices in Europe. We classified different agroforestry systems based on the LUCAS database, finding that most agroforestry in Europe is in areas associated with older human populations of varying densities and employment levels at lower altitudes, gentler slopes, moderate annual mean temperature and precipitation, and in medium textured soils with limited organic carbon content. Focusing on the prevalent agroforestry system of silvopasture, the majority of which is found in three Mediterranean ecoregions of mainly sclerophyllous forests, the most important factors for the occurrence of this system were subsoil available water content (Aegean), land cover (Adriatic), and topsoil available water content (Iberian). The suitable area for silvopasture according to MaxEnt was 32%, 30%, and 22% of the Aegean, Adriatic, and Iberian ecoregion’s area, respectively. Such mapping of agroforestry suitability can help policymakers to undertake adaptive management for the implementation of agroforestry-based solutions to address ecosystem restoration, food insecurity, and rapid environmental changes and threats. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Post-Industrial Urban Greenspace Ecology, Aesthetics and Justice","This book ofers original theoretical and empirical insight into the social, cultural and ecological politics of rapidly changing urban spaces such as old factories, rail yards, verges, dumps and quarries. These environments are often disregarded once their industrial functions wane, a trend that cities are experiencing through the advance of late capitalism. From a sustainability perspective, there are important lessons to learn about the potential prospects and perils of these disused sites. The combination of shelter, standing water and infrequent human visitation renders such spaces ecologically vibrant, despite residual toxicity and other environmentally undesirable conditions. They are also spaces of social refuge. Three case studies in Milwaukee, Paris and Toronto anchor the book, each of which ofers unique analytical insight into the forms, functions and experiences of post-industrial urban greenspaces. Through this research, this book challenges the dominant instinct in Western urban planning to ""rediscover"" and redevelop these spaces for economic growth rather than ecological resilience and social justice. This book will be of great interest to students and researchers of urban planning, ecological design, landscape architecture, urban geography, environmental planning, restoration ecology and aesthetics. © 2023 Jennifer Foster.

Food protection activities of the Pan American Health Organization.,"One of the most widespread health problems in the Caribbean and Latin America is contaminated food and foodborne illness. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has been a major force in activities to strengthen food protection. The program within the regional Program of Technical Cooperation is administered by the Veterinary Public Health program and under the guidance of the Pan American Institute for Food protection and Zoonoses in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A food action plan for 1986-90 was established at the 1986 Pan American Sanitary Conference, and extended to cover 1991-95. Program activities during the 1990s covered cholera, epidemiologic surveillance, street food vendors, shellfish poisoning, meat, national programs, information systems, air catering, food irradiation, and tourism. The action plan for 1991-95 promoted greater political support and cooperation within and between related sectors and institutions, management, and education. The aims were to organize national integrated programs, to strengthen laboratory services, to strengthen inspection services, to establish epidemiologic surveillance systems, and to promote food protection through community participation. Program activities included the initiatives of the Veterinary Public Health Program in 1991 to distribute literature on the transmission of cholera by foods. Studies were conducted in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru on food contamination. Microbiologists received training on standard methods for detecting Vibrio cholerae in foods. A working group of experts from 10 countries examined the issues and produced a guide for investigating the incidence of foodborne disease. PAHO has contributed to the formation of an Inter-American Network for Epidemiologic Surveillance of Foodborne Diseases. PAHO has worked to improve hygienic practices among street food vendors. Seminars on paralytic shellfish poisoning were conducted in 1990; the outcome was a network working to strengthen national surveillance programs. The safety and quality of meat products was strengthened through the 3-week training course in 1992 on detection of residues of anabolic agents in meat and poultry.

In essence, this volume offers a social agenda for America-one that begins with understanding that social factors are fundamental to the progress of humanity and that development of civil and peaceful social relationships have been the basis for human progress. These social factors also help explain the challenges that we now face including homelessness, major health disparities, family violence, social isolation, climate change, massive incarceration, extreme economic inequality, unequal opportunity and justice, and long lives that too often lack productivity. This volume bring analysis of these challenges but, more significantly, also brings ideas about how to make measurable progress in a decade and how we can better bring existing advances to scale. The Grand Challenges emphasize bringing different professions together to work on these problems and to help create innovative new interventions that will bring greater social cohesion; development of individuals, families, and communities, and social responses that foster society’s strength. © Oxford University Press 2018.

Resilience (Republished),"Resilience thinking in relation to the environment has emerged as a lens of inquiry that serves a platform for interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. Resilience is about cultivating the capacity to sustain development in the face of expected and surprising change and diverse pathways of development and potential thresholds between them. The evolution of resilience thinking is coupled to socialecological systems and a truly intertwined human-environment planet. Resilience as persistence, adaptability, and transformability of complex adaptive social-ecological systems is the focus, clarifying the dynamic and forward-looking nature of the concept. Resilience thinking emphasizes that social-ecological systems, from the individual, to community, to society as a whole, are embedded in the biosphere. The biosphere connection is an essential observation if sustainability is to be taken seriously. In the continuous advancement of resilience thinking there are efforts aimed at capturing resilience of social-ecological systems and finding ways for people and institutions to govern social-ecological dynamics for improved human well-being, at the local, across levels and scales, to the global. Consequently, in resilience thinking, development issues for human well-being, for people and planet, are framed in a context of understanding and governing complex social-ecological dynamics for sustainability as part of a dynamic biosphere. © 2016 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Foreword: Toward an Era of Longevity and Wealth,"This foreword provides an overview of demographic development during the past three centuries, as life expectancy and per-capita growth of GDP have increased dramatically. Due to the intense interplay between physiological improvement and technological advances, humans have increased their body size by more than 50% in the past two centuries, and the betterment of general sanitation, reduction of air pollution in the cities, and higher food intake have improved life expectancy. It is argued that demographers have consistently underestimated the impact of such improvements and, consequently, have underestimated gains in life expectancy. With more workers living longer and healthier lives, men in Western countries have four times more leisure than they did a century ago, and this trend will continue. This achievement has devastating financial implications for already overburdened social security systems and calls for a careful re-examination of social security to ensure future sustainability. © Pension Research Council, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 2008.

Renewable resources: A necessity for the sustainable development of Romania,"During the last years, the public opinion has increasingly expressed the economic and social needs. Everyone should have access to the facilities that improve the quality of life such as economic security, health, education, freedom and political representation. Everyone has economic and social needs that should be fulfilled. Renewable resources can regenerate and can be indefinitely used if they are managed properly. One the renewable resources are consumed at a rate that exceeds their natural regeneration rate, they shall diminish and eventually run out. Renewable resources can resist accordingly to their regeneration rate and the available quantity. During the last 20 years a new interest area came up: the problems related to the environment. The efforts to improve the quality of life resulted in the deterioration of the environment. While the climate changes, the forests disappear, the pollution degree increases, and it is obvious that we should pay more attention to the environment in order to avoid the high price of living without the support of the environment. In the first part of the current paper, we reviewed the potential and the role of renewable energy of Romania by referring to specific specialty studies in the analyzed area. In the second part we created a simple regression model based on the correlation of final energy consumption and the Romanian Gross Domestic Product in order to illustrate the energetic efficiency of the country. In the last part, we underlined certain relevant conclusions regarding the renewable resources potential and their impact on the quality of life in Romania. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).",Not About Sufficiency

The Plague Fighter: Wu Lien-teh and the beginning of the Chinese public health system,"At the end of 1910, when the Qing dynasty was on the verge of collapse and the whole Chinese empire in a process of transformation, North Manchuria was devastated by a large pneumonic plague epidemic. The Russian and Japanese governments wanted to use the outbreak of the disease as a pretext to invade north-east China, making plague an issue of international politics. At this dramatic moment the empire relied on the skills of the young Chinese doctor Wu Lien-teh, the first Chinese medical graduate from Cambridge. Wu investigated the disease on the spot, chaired an international plague conference in Shenyang (Manchuria) in April 1911, and, later on, became the figurehead of fundamental public health reforms in Republican China. Highly ambitious, striving for personal fame and international renown for China, supported by an excellent network of personal connections, and equipped with a medical training considered the best in the world at the time, he launched on a startling career as one of China's key medical reformers and international representatives. His history is an example of the inseparable links between personal fate and historical events, and between the interests of scientists, medical men, politicians, and businessmen on the national and international stages. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency

Just Cessation: How Might the Climate Imperative to Phase Out Fossil Fuel Extraction Reshape the Concept of Just Transition?,"Just transition has emerged as a master conceptual framework for limiting environmental and socially destructive industrial activity in the climate change era. While it has been widely embraced, its anchoring in the open-ended concept of sustainable development has meant that it has been used to legitimate ongoing future fossil fuel extraction. This article discusses the implications for just transition that arise from the recognition that the timely cessation of fossil fuel extraction is the sine qua non of the realization of the sustainable development goals. It offers a historical explanation for the minimal engagement to date between just transition advocacy and fossil fuel cessation. It then discusses the implications of acknowledging the necessity of fossil fuel cessation in terms of core labour law principles. Finally, the article outlines the implications of explicitly embedding fossil fuel phase down as an objective of just transition for government actors and social partners. © (2023), Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",Not About Sufficiency
Breeding and domesticating crops adapted to drought and salinity: A new paradigm for increasing food production,"World population is expected to reach 9.2 × 109 people by 2050. Feeding them will require a boost in crop productivity using innovative approaches. Current agricultural production is very dependent on large amounts of inputs and water availability is a major limiting factor. In addition, the loss of genetic diversity and the threat of climate change make a change of paradigm in plant breeding and agricultural practices necessary. Average yields in all major crops are only a small fraction of record yields, and drought and soil salinity are the main factors responsible for yield reduction. Therefore there is the need to enhance crop productivity by improving crop adaptation. Here we review the present situation and propose the development of crops tolerant to drought and salt stress for addressing the challenge of dramatically increasing food production in the near future. The success in the development of crops adapted to drought and salt depends on the efficient and combined use of genetic engineering and traditional breeding tools. Moreover, we propose the domestication of new halophilic crops to create a ‘saline agriculture’ which will not compete in terms of resources with conventional agriculture. © 2015 Fita, Rodríguez-Burruezo, Boscaiu, Prohens and Vicente.",Not About Sufficiency

CONNECTING BIODIVERSITYAND HUMAN WELLBEING,"Across the world, urban human populations are expanding rapidly. The negative stressors associated with city living can lead to both physical and mental ill health, the costs of which are accumulating steadily. Urban green and blue space can benefit human health and wellbeing through a variety of mechanisms (e.g. reducing physiological stress, restoring attentional capacity). These same spaces also provide vital habitat for biodiversity. However, there is little consensus regarding how specific biodiversity attributes (e.g. different species, colours, sounds) affect people’s wellbeing, due to the rich and complex ways people perceive their surroundings. Comparisons between studies are further complicated by use of a diverse range of wellbeing measures, biodiversity metrics, sampling methodologies, and biases in geographical locations. Nonetheless, policy-makers and practitioners must trade off between multiple environmental and social benefits and dis-benefits, finding interventions that deliver positive reinforcing outcomes for both biodiversity conservation and public health. Human experiences of urban nature need to therefore be explored empirically, systematically, and with more nuance in relation to biodiversity specifically. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Charles H.

Nicaragua's Buen Vivir: a strategy for tourism development?,"Although often framed as an emerging anthropocenic socio-ecological imaginary, the Latin American paradigm of Buen Vivir has provided a broad base of support for tourism development in the region. This article focuses on Nicaragua's Buen Vivir, a national development campaign entitled “Live Clean, Live Healthy, Live Beautiful, Live Well” (called Vivir Bonito, Vivir Bien) The campaign was launched in 2013 as a multi-pronged approach to integrated development in distinct areas including employment, public health, waste management, education, urban aesthetics and national pride. However, it has also had the effect of opening up opportunities for tourism development not only in the capital city of Managua but also alongside other mega-projects such as the planned interoceanic canal. This article draws upon the example of Vivir Bonito, Vivir Bien to illustrate the variety of tourism development strategies currently emerging at the intersection of a left-turn toward Socialism of the 21st Century and Buen Vivir in Latin America, on the one hand, and a post-neoliberal context in which political economic projects of the past continue to leave their mark. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Health impacts of asphalt emissions: Examining neurological risks and the need for long-term exposure mitigation,"Asphalt, widely used in infrastructure, emits complex chemical mixtures throughout its service life, posing significant risks to human health and the environment. This expanded understanding extends the concern from a construction-related hazard to a broader public health issue, especially affecting vulnerable populations like children who play on blacktop surfaces. Despite increased awareness, the specific mechanisms behind asphalt emissions, their impact on asphalt deterioration, and their effects on the human nervous system remain poorly understood. Our study addresses these knowledge gaps by examining the long-term health effects of asphalt emissions, focusing on neurological impacts. We investigate how environmental stressors and asphalt's chemical composition influence emission types and severity, using a combination of in vitro experiments, Drosophila melanogaster models, and advanced computational analyses. FTIR analysis reveals that as asphalt ages, emissions evolve from aliphatic to aromatic compounds, increasing toxicity. Our results demonstrate significant neurological damage from asphalt emissions, with effects worsening with age and being more pronounced in females, as shown in the Drosophila model, emphasizing the need for gender-specific health risk research. In vitro studies using 3T3L1 cells show that VOC exposure disrupts lipid droplet formation and metabolism, processes linked to neurodegenerative disorders. To mitigate emissions, our novel approach introduces wood-based biochar as a functional carbon to enhance intermolecular interactions within asphalt. GC-MS analysis indicates that biochar reduces VOC emissions by up to 76 %, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations highlight biochar's effectiveness in hindering free-radical diffusion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm biochar's role, with adsorption energies of −20.4 kcal/mol, demonstrating strong and stable interactions that decelerate oxidative aging and mass loss. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of emission mechanisms and propose a sustainable strategy to enhance asphalt durability while reducing environmental and health risks. This in turn provides evidence-based recommendations for the asphalt industry, emphasizing proactive measures toward long-term exposure mitigation.

Understanding food security and international security links in the context of climate change,"Abstract: Food production has been changing significantly in recent years as a result of climate change and of growing demand for food. This article aims to understand the link between food security and international security in the context of climate change, applying a systematic and qualitative analysis of the literature using the bibliometric method. This research observes that climate change tends to affect agricultural productivity, exposing societies to risk and the need for migration. However, good governance, together with international cooperation, can reduce the hazards of food insecurity, strengthening ties between countries and stimulating a fairer and more inclusive form of international trade. © 2016 Southseries Inc., www.thirdworldquarterly.com.",Not About Sufficiency
Review of the Role of Orphan Crops in Food Security,"Ethiopia is one of the most populated countries in Africa. Agriculture employs over 70% of the population. It is dominated by small-scale farmers who practice rain-fed mixed farming by using traditional technology, adopting a low input and low output production system. As a result, it is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions. Cereal crops provide food for the majority of Ethiopians, so most agricultural transformation plans prioritize increasing cereal crop productivity. However, about five million people experience food insecurity each year and require support. Population growth, environmental degradation, conflict, and climate change are the most serious threats to the nation’s food security. In a time when the food supply cannot keep up with population expansion, there is a need for holistic solutions to development-related issues such as food insecurity, malnutrition, and poverty. Despite Ethiopia being a center of origin and diversity for several food crops, the potential benefits of underutilized indigenous crops are yet not exploited. However, they can play a significant part in human nutrition, income, and medicinal value. As a result, crop diversification may be the best choice for achieving household food security. One way to help the nation’s food systems diversify is to include more orphan crops. Even though a small portion of the country’s land is dedicated to underused crops, more than 20% of the population relies on them for food. Orphan crops, such as inset, which can feed 100 million people, can help to attain food security in Ethiopia. As a result, promoting and researching these crops is the most sustainable strategy for lowering and managing poverty and food insecurity in Ethiopia. © 2022 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Quantification of uncertainties in global grazing systems assessment,"Livestock systems play a key role in global sustainability challenges like food security and climate change, yet many unknowns and large uncertainties prevail. We present a systematic, spatially explicit assessment of uncertainties related to grazing intensity (GI), a key metric for assessing ecological impacts of grazing, by combining existing data sets on (a) grazing feed intake, (b) the spatial distribution of livestock, (c) the extent of grazing land, and (d) its net primary productivity (NPP). An analysis of the resulting 96 maps implies that on average 15% of the grazing land NPP is consumed by livestock. GI is low in most of the world's grazing lands, but hotspots of very high GI prevail in 1% of the total grazing area. The agreement between GI maps is good on one fifth of the world's grazing area, while on the remainder, it is low to very low. Largest uncertainties are found in global drylands and where grazing land bears trees (e.g., the Amazon basin or the Taiga belt). In some regions like India or Western Europe, massive uncertainties even result in GI > 100% estimates. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that the input data for NPP, animal distribution, and grazing area contribute about equally to the total variability in GI maps, while grazing feed intake is a less critical variable. We argue that a general improvement in quality of the available global level data sets is a precondition for improving the understanding of the role of livestock systems in the context of global environmental change or food security. ©2017.

Valuation of agricultural production and pollination services in palm trees (Arecaceae) in the Amazon forest,"Palm trees (Arecaceae) are among the most important plants in the world, providing food and subsistence for various populations, especially in the Amazon region. Many of these trees depend on pollinators to produce fruits. In this study, we evaluated the pollination service values in 13 palm crops in the Brazilian Legal Amazon based on the agricultural production values of each species and their dependencies on pollinators, and we compared the values between forested and non-forested areas. We also aimed to review the scientific literature to present the most important pollinator species of those same palm crops. The total production value of the palms was estimated at US$239.9 million/year (2017), and 85% of this value was associated with the açaí fruit (Euterpe oleracea). The municipalities that had the highest production values were in the State of Pará (79.5%), considered the largest açaí producer in Brazil. The second most important crop was babassu (Attalea speciosa), with its production concentrated mainly in the State of Maranhão. Pollination services were valued at US$144.2 million/year, with açaí cultivation corresponding to 92% of this value. The forested areas were responsible for 86.4% of the total production value, with a pollination service value of US$127 million/year. The main pollinators reported were insects of the orders Hymenoptera (Apidae) and Coleoptera (especially Curculionidae). The results obtained in this study highlight the importance of pollinators to produce fruits and seeds in palm crops and reinforce the need to conserve both the pollinators and the forest, to ensure food security and the sustainable development of the region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Phytosanitary prescription to minimize pesticide use risk on human and animal health and the environment at European level,"Incorrect, inappropriate or abusive use of plant protection products (PPPs) can lead to some serious problems for human and animal health, and the environment. It is well-known that global transition to sustainable food and agriculture will require major improvements in the efficiency of the resources used, in environmental protection and in systems resilience. This study aims, firstly, to revise the challenges of the primary production and the essential role of plant protection, together with a deep overview of the EU pesticide regulatory framework. Secondly, being the European framework one of the most advanced ones in the world, even in such scenario, in order to minimize pesticide use risk at European level, the study raises the need to establish a phytosnitary prescription for certain cases, subject to the figure of the Phytosanitary Prescriber. It would be a competent specialized technician with extensive training and technical intervention capacity specialized in plant health, with civil liability insurance and endorsed by a Professional Association. The Phytosanitary Prescriber would be a strategic figure and of great responsibility to achieve the sustainable use of PPPs, being responsible for diagnosis of the phytosanitary practice to be followed and the prescription and recipe for the dispensing of PPPs. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of Water Consumers Literacy,"Nowadays, an increasing amount of water is used without the awareness that this resource is not inexhaustible. In fact, pollution, environmental degradation and/or climate change caused by human activities lead to the degradation of the quality of available water. In 2015, the United Nations warned about the risk of reaching a water deficit of 40%, in 2030, if consumption patterns are not changed. Indeed, population growth is one of the main causes for this deficit. The protection and sustainable consumption of water is one of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, to ensure that the world’s population has access to clean water, free from pollution and managed responsibly. Thus, governments and non-governmental organizations must promote the conscious and informed use of water by the population. It is mandatory that the population becomes aware of the need for efficient management of water resources, ensuring their quality and preventing their degradation, in order to not compromise/jeopardize their future availability. The knowledge of the population’s literacy on water issues and on water quality—health interconnections is essential to design plans leading to the implementation of eco-sustainable practices. The goal of this research was to evaluate the literacy of water consumers and to establish a forecast model for water literacy managing. The collection of information was conducted through the inquiry by questionnaire technique and applied on a cohort encompassing 453 participants. The questionnaire includes three main dimensions (Water Quality, Disease Prevention and Sustainability/Public Health Promotion) and in each dimension, four competencies were evaluated (obtain, understand, assess and apply information regarding water consumption). The results obtained allow to assert that in the two first dimensions, the competence in which participants show more difficulty is assess. Regarding the Sustainability/Public Health Promotion, the participants show more difficulty in the competence apply. The model presented in this research, grounded on the connectionist paradigm, has shown great efficiency in the forecast of the target variable. The key contribution of the present research is to present an integrated and systematic approach that can give a contribution to the increase of water literacy, which allows the implementation of eco-sustainable practices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Irrigation depth and silicate fertilisation in green maize,"The successful use of irrigation depends on the adoption of efficient management, which in turn depends on determining the correct amount of irrigation water. Due to the water scarcity seen in recent years, there is an obvious need for strategies that would make it possible to reduce the amount of water applied to crops with no reduction in productivity. Among such strategies, the application of silicon, which is associated with several beneficial effects fbr the plant, can increase water use efficiency. The aim of the present work was to study irrigation-depth management versus silicon doses via foliar application in green maize under a semi-arid climate. The experiment was conducted from August to November 2017 in an area of the Federal Institute of Ceará, Iguatu Campus, Ceará, using the AG1051 hybrid. The experimental design was of randomised blocks, comprising split plots and four blocks. Five irrigation depths (50, 75, 100, 125 and 150% of the ETc) were evaluated in the plots and four doses of silicon (50, 100, 150 and 200% of the recommended dose) were evaluated in the subplots. The following growth variables were analysed 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 days after sowing (DAS): leaf dry weight, stem dry weight, and total dry weight; the production variables, evaluated at 81 DAS, were ear diameter and ear length with no husks, ear weight with and with no husks, and productivity. The application of silicon had no significant effect on the variables, while the irrigation depths afforded linear growth fbr each variable, with the highest productivity (10,459.3 kg ha-1) obtained fbr the greatest irrigation depth of 600 mm (150% of the ETc) © 2022.

Understanding the impact of drought in coffea genotypes: Transcriptomic analysis supports a common high resilience to moderate water deficit but a genotype dependent sensitivity to severe water deficit,"Water scarcity is the most significant factor limiting coffee production, although some cultivars can still have important drought tolerance. This study analyzed leaf transcriptomes of two coffee cultivars with contrasting physiological responses, Coffea canephora cv. CL153 and Coffea. arabica cv. Icatu, subjected to moderate (MWD) or severe water deficits (SWD). We found that MWD had a low impact compared with SWD, where 10% of all genes in Icatu and 17% in CL153 reacted to drought, being mainly down-regulated upon stress. Drought triggered a genotype-specific response involving the up-regulation of reticuline oxidase genes in CL153 and heat shock proteins in Icatu. Responsiveness to drought also included desiccation protectant genes, but primarily, aspartic proteases, especially in CL153. A total of 83 Transcription Factors were found engaged in response to drought, mainly up-regulated, especially under SWD. Together with the enrollment of 49 phosphatases and 272 protein kinases, results suggest the involvement of ABA-signaling processes in drought acclimation. The integration of these findings with complementing physiological and biochemical studies reveals that both genotypes are more resilient to moderate drought than previously thought and suggests the existence of post-transcriptional mechanisms modulating the response to drought. © 2021 by the authors.

Agricultural Challenges and Adaptation for Changing Climate: A Study on Early Flash Flood-prone Areas in Bangladesh,"Bangladesh’s environment and climate have changed a lot and Bangladesh has converted as the most exposed country. This vulnerability is exposed in adverse way in Bangladesh due to magnitude of changing climate. It can be said that for national food security, respective agricultural household should adapt to climate change. A large portion of inhabitants of Bangladesh are dependent on agriculture for their needs, living, income and maintenance, and most importantly economic growth also depends on agriculture. To adapt to climate vulnerability, farmers may face many challenges. In this regard, the first motto was to perceive the level of challenges faced in agriculture such as unpredictable weather, excess cost of inputs, restricted access to agricultural markets, etc. during production. For fulfilling this specific objective, adoption of resilience indices to agriculture were developed. Those adoption resilience indices were making hurdles for farmer’s livelihood and adjustment due to climate change. The adoption resilience indices were calculated through the principal confrontation matrix, and it was found that “unpredictable weather” ranked as number one followed by the high cost of farm inputs. Another objective of this exploration was to explore how those adaptation resilience indices affect farmers’ enthusiasm for their adaptation. To fulfil this objective, the ordered logit model had been used using 378 boro cultivator’s data which were collected from selected ‘haor’ (lowland) in Sylhet. The results show that the two variables namely “Changed in crop varieties” and “Changed crop to livestock” had a positive impact on the farmers’ adapting strategies for changing climate. That means, those farmers were easily motivated to change their crop varieties and preferred rearing livestock during flood. © 2023 by authors, all rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Decline in reproductive health and its transgenerational lag effect,"In the last two decades, there has been a fast-growing prevalence of infertility reported in China. Moreover, Chinese reproductive health has shown a clear decline. Thus, it is imperative to determine the precipitating causes and the root causes of this decline. Environmental and climate risks (ECRs) may cause the decline in reproductive health. Experimental findings have shown that the impact of ECRs on reproductive health can be passed down from both males and females to their offspring, demonstrating an intergenerational and transgenerational lag effect. We perceive that the declined reproductive health may lead to negative demographic consequences in China; therefore, we suggest the following five regulations be implemented: (i) prevent Chinese of childbearing age from exposure to ECRs; (ii) further develop and promote assisted reproductive technology and set up sperm and ovum banks on a national scale; (iii) quantitatively establish the causality between fathers and mothers who suffer from ECRs and the impaired reproductive health in their progeny; (iv) teach ECRs-health knowledge in psychotherapeutic training and continuing education; and (v) propagate and further promote common prosperity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Integrated Mining and Reclamation Practices Enhance Sustainable Land Use: A Case Study in Huainan Coalfield, China","In the coal-grain composite area (CGCA) of eastern China with a high groundwater table (HGT), underground coal mining subsidence has caused extensive submergence of farmland, posing a significant threat to regional food security. Currently, land reclamation techniques in mining subsidence areas primarily focus on post-mining reclamation (PMR) of stable subsidence land with a low reclamation rate. This study investigated the application of concurrent mining and reclamation (CMR) technology for unstable subsidence land in a representative HGT mining area, namely the Guqiao Coal Mine in the Huainan Coalfield. Firstly, mining subsidence prediction and geographic information technology were employed to simulate the spatio-temporal evolution of dynamic mining subsidence, taking into consideration the mining plan. Subsequently, phased reclamation parameters were quantitatively designed by integrating the dynamic mining subsidence and surface reclamation measures. Lastly, scenario simulations were conducted to discuss the effectiveness of CMR in comparison with non-reclamation (NR) and PMR. Additionally, reclamation and ecological restoration strategies for coal mining subsidence areas with comprehensive governance modes were proposed. The findings indicated that mining activities have led to a reduction in both the quantity and quality of original farmland, with 70% of the farmland submerged and rendered uncultivable. In contrast to PMR, which achieved a reclamation rate of 29%, CMR can significantly increase the farmland reclamation rate to 69% while also prolonging the service life of farmland. This study provides theoretical support and technical references for promoting sustainable mining practices, protecting farmland, and facilitating the high-quality development of coal resource-based cities. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Cultural food distancing: a conceptual discourse on the evolution of seminal to present and future models of traditional food practices,"Purpose: This manuscript focuses on theoretical past, present and future models for defining food culture and cuisine, comparing these principles with contemporary literature evidence of transformative global food practices during public health and environmental crisis. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to explain the point at which traditional practices are discernible from the effects of modern technology, globalization, marketing and the virtualization of consumption. The paper explains how current local and global ecologies contribute to the retainment or disassembly of established culinary borders. Design/methodology/approach: This is a theoretical paper that highlights seminal and present discourse on food cultural practices. Furthermore, it underlines the cultural changes during environmental crises and whether these cultural transformations in food practices will be lasting. The authors suggest a perspective model for the future. Findings: Deciphering whether traditional foodways are moderated by modernity and environmental changes is very complex and multifactorial. This is likely nuanced by the availability of commodities and the steadfastness of particular cultures. Whether or not consumers embrace a new food product is likely contingent on their fundamental familiarity with and availability of the product's traditional components. The integrity of traditional foodstuffs will continue to be valued and demanded by broad groups of consumers into the foreseeable future. Research limitations/implications: As a primary objective, food producers, manufacturers and governments should not seek to actively diminish cultural borders and markets. Industry and governmental strategists should embrace and promote cultural food messages in any interventional strategies on household food security or marketing strategies and campaigns. The gathering of information from grassroot cultural groups about traditional food practices should ground the development of new policies and products. Practical implications: Understanding the complexities surrounding traditional cuisines and food ways gives insight into the future of traditional food cultures and how they change. The food industry is undergoing profound transformation due to climate change; the decrease of arable land; environmental crisis, such as floods and droughts; war; food insecurity; aging populations; and chronic food-related diseases and disorders. Therefore, new food products are essential to adjust to these issues. However, the use and effectiveness of these foods would likely be enhanced if they were tailored with ingredients and techniques that have meaning to particular cultural groups. Social implications: Social connectivity, the shared experiences of eating together (and the contingent health benefits) may have been subject to contemporaneous or permanent change due to transformation in local and global food ecologies. Whether or not consumers embrace new food products may be contingent on their fundamental familiarity with its traditional components. The integrity of traditional foodstuffs is likely to continue to be valued and demanded by broad groups of consumers into the foreseeable future. Originality/value: Seminal food culture theories are still being utilized in recent publications to explain contemporary practices, particularly in times of crisis such as the recent pandemic. Current scholarship has indicated, to degrees, that links to traditional food practices may be strong, evolving or are becoming more obscure as they are incorporated into a global fabric. There are gaps in the literature that necessitate more exportation of the impact of environmental changes and health crisis on cultural and traditional food practices. This further raises questions about how the formative theories on food culture apply to modern and future food practices. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Determinants of cotton farmers’ irrigation water management in arid Northwestern China,"To combat China's water crisis tremendous research efforts are undertaken aiming at the improvement of water management in cotton production, which is the major consumer of the scarce water resources in arid Northwestern China. In recent years extensive field experiment based research strongly enhanced the theoretical knowledge of optimal water management in cotton production. However, farmers’ actual irrigation water productivity remains low. To fill the critical void the present study aims at increasing the understanding of Chinese cotton farmers’ actual irrigation water management. The northwestern Chinese Aksu-Tarim Region was selected as a hot-spot of water scarcity in China, where around 60% of total sown crop land are cultivated with cotton. The increasing overuse of scarce surface water resources for irrigation not only leads to severe ecological degradation, but also increases competition among water users triggering the expansion of groundwater exploitation. Based on primary survey data of 228 cotton producing farm households we firstly analyze the production factors determining farmers’ yield and irrigation water productivity (IWP). Apart from soil salinity and unbalanced fertilization, which negatively affect yield and IWP, especially the applied irrigation method (drip vs. flood irrigation) and installation of a groundwater well were identified as major determinants. Secondly, we apply logistic regression to evaluate which household and farm characteristics determine the irrigation method and installation of groundwater well. We find that farm size, crop types and cropping intensity determine the use of drip irrigation. We furthermore find that the installation of well is largely related to marginalization, with farm families of ethnic minorities, remote farms and lower educated families being more likely to install wells. The findings of our study can help policymakers in devising strategies for improving irrigation water productivity, while reducing groundwater degradation in the study region and similar arid production regions in the world. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Efficiency and sustainability indicators for passenger and commodities transportation systems. The case of Siena, Italy","Three different energy analysis approaches (energy and embodied energy, exergy and emergy analysis) have been applied to the road and railway systems of a medium size district of central Italy, in order to shed light on the dynamics of the local transport sector and develop a tool for analysis capable of taking the system complexity into account, Road and railway systems, respectively, support passenger flows of 3.57E9 p-km (passengers per km) per year and 0.17E9 p-km per year and commodity flows of 2.5E9 t-km (tonnes per km) per year and 0.35E9 t-km per year, generating a total energy consumption equal to 1.84E5 tonnes of oil equivalent per year. The passenger mass transport on road (buses) shows globally the best performance among the patterns investigated, while railway ranks higher for commodity transport, according to most of the calculated intensity indicators. Several improvement options are also evaluated on the basis of the first- and second-order exergy efficiency. Some of the suggested improvements, even showing high theoretical possibility, do not match the transport needs of the investigated area, as indicated by their huge material and emergy intensities (measures of ecological footprints) even if it cannot be excluded that they may appear more appropriate to nationwide transportation patterns. In conclusion, although data and indicators refer to a well identified region under specific geographic and socio-economic conditions, results suggest that a complex system such as transport is very unlikely to be described by a linear relation between input resource and output service delivered. Even when thermodynamically based approaches are properly used to describe the system behavior, findings very often do not converge, and require that different indicators are compared to yield a comprehensive picture of the system dynamics. An integrated approach is therefore suggested to support decision making in the presence of diverging results. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of Brazil's Madeira River Dams: Unlearned lessons for hydroelectric development in Amazonia,"The Santo AntÔnio and Jirau dams, under construction on the Madeira River, will have significant impacts, including flooding in Bolivia due to the Jirau reservoir's backwater stretch. The reservoirs eliminate natural ecosystems, and the dams block fish migration affecting both biodiversity and commercial production, especially of the giant catfish of the Madeira River that are important resources in Bolivia and Peru as well as Brazil. Changes in flooding regimes in downstream várzea (floodplain) lakes will also affect fisheries. Mercury methylation and greenhouse-gas emissions are additional problems. The reservoirs form part of a planned series of waterways that, if completed, would open large areas in Bolivian Amazonia to soybeans, thus stimulating deforestation. The dams have significant social impacts, including displacing riverside population and eliminating livelihoods from fishing. Despite the technical staff responsible for environmental licensing having submitted a formal opinion considering these concerns to be exceedingly serious and insufficiently studied to authorize dam construction, political appointees approved the licenses. The Madeira Dams offer important lessons for environmental control in Brazil and in many other countries facing similar challenges. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
“Water Is Life”: Local Perceptions of Páramo Grasslands and Land Management Strategies Associated with Payment for Ecosystem Services,"Andean páramo grasslands have long supported human populations that depend on them as forage for livestock and, increasingly, have been recognized as critical water sources with large soil carbon stores and high levels of biodiversity. Recent conservation efforts have used payment for ecosystem services (PES) to incentivize land management that aims to enhance ecosystem services related to water, carbon, and biodiversity, as well as local livelihoods. Data to assess ecological and social outcomes of these programs are limited, however. In particular, a better understanding of how incentivized land management practices affect the local values and uses of páramos is needed. We conducted interviews with PES participants on their perceptions of the value of páramos and of management practices incentivized through PES—afforestation and removal of burning—and linked them with data on ecological outcomes of those practices. We found that local perceptions of páramo values include provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services, underpinning basic needs, security, health, and social relations. In some cases, local perceptions align with research on ecological outcomes of PES, whereas in others, expectations of PES participants are unlikely to be met. We also found examples of both synergies—where PES land management strengthens an existing páramo value—and trade-offs, in which existing benefits might be diminished. By improving understanding of how people perceive the benefits they obtain from páramos and how participation in PES is likely to affect those uses and values, our findings help connect local perceptions with ecological science to inform policy and management. © 2017 by American Association of Geographers.",Not About Sufficiency
"Catastrophic risk, climate change and disaster law","Disaster law promises to become an increasingly important subject over the course of this century. Climate change will increase the frequency of extreme weather events, while more people and property will be at risk due to population growth, coastal development and economic growth. Depending on the extent of climate change, the risks vary from serious to catastrophic. In dealing with these increased levels of risk, the entire disaster cycle must be considered, from pre-disaster risk mitigation to emergency response, followed by insurance and compensation, and rebuilding (and then by another potential disaster). This article provides a framework for considering these issues and sets forth five grand challenges for scholars and policymakers. These challenges require improvement in key areas: techniques for planning in the face of uncertainty; property and land-use rules; sensitivity to issues of social justice; the international framework for emergency disaster response; and mechanisms for risk spreading.",Not About Sufficiency
Trade-off and synergy relationships and regional regulation of multifunctional cultivated land in the Yellow River Basin,"Exploring the multifunctional trade-off and synergy relationship of cultivated land is of great significance for protecting cultivated land resources, ensuring food security, maintaining ecological security, and promoting high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin. Based on the selection of 379 counties with concentrated distribution of cultivated land, this study comprehensively evaluates the three-dimensional functional level of “production-society-ecology” of cultivated land from 2010 to 2020. The coupling coordination degree model, land system function trade-off degree model, and K-means clustering analysis method are used to analyze the trade-off and synergy relationship between cultivated land functions and divide the functional zones in the Yellow River Basin. 1) In the last 10 years, the levels of cultivated land production, social, and ecological functions in the Yellow River Basin are in the range of 0.01–0.47, 0.04 to 0.23, and 0.03 to 0.23, respectively. The production function is at a stable level, while the overall level of social and ecological functions has slightly improved. 2) The level of multifunctional coupling and coordination of cultivated land ranges from 0.22 to 0.65. Only 31.13% of counties have a high coupling degree between multiple functions. The production-ecological function in the upstream regions show a coordinated development trend. The social-ecological function in the midstream regions is well coordinated, and the production-social function and production-ecological function in downstream regions towards collaborative development. 3) According to the dominant functional types and the characteristics of multifunctional coupling and coordination, the cultivated land of Yellow River Basin is divided into 7 multifunctional zones, involving 149 with multifunctional advantage zones, 19 with P-S functional composite zones, 21 with P-E functional composite zones, 21 with S-E functional composite zones, 74 with social functional dominant zones, 29 with ecological functional dominant zones, 44 with grain functional dominant zones, and 22 with remediation key zones. The results can provide decision support for differentiated management of cultivated land in the Yellow River Basin and mutual promotion between functions.

"Poverty and biodiversity in rural areas based on two investigations in Pujiang County, China","This study presents an integrated framework for the analysis of options of agricultural development and natural resource management at the ecosystem level. Pujiang County in Zhejiang Province, China, is used as a case-study area. The IMGLP model is applied to maximize regional agricultural economic surplus and labor market conditions in Pujiang. The consequences of four poverty reduction strategies (intensification of production, diversification toward livestock production, land expansion, and exit from agriculture) are determined for a set of regional poverty and biodiversity indicators. Diversification seems to be the most promising poverty reduction strategy, but requires an efficient use of animal manure in cropping systems to avoid environmental problems. Improved nutrient management in cropping systems is effective in reducing the regional nitrogen surplus, but less effective in increasing per capita income. The exit strategy is beneficial for reducing poverty and achieving biodiversity, but may have important social consequences that are not addressed in this study. Further reduction of rural poverty is hampered by labor constraints during the harvesting period for high-value crops such as vegetables and fruits. These constraints can be overcome by intensive research and development in the field of agricultural mechanization. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"A nexus approach to food, water, and energy: Sustainably meeting Asia's future food and nutrition requirements","Agricultural and food production systems in Asia must undergo a significant transformation in order to meet the concurrent challenges of increasing food, water, and energy demands amid on-going climate change. This is particularly true in countries in South Asia, including Pakistan, where hunger and undernutrition persist and natural resource are increasingly strained. Sustainable intensification with a focus on nutrition is particularly crucial to provide adequate and nutritious food for all without further damages to the planet. However, a silo approach to meeting the demands of a growing, increasingly urbanised, and wealthier population is no longer acceptable. Instead, capitalising on the inter sectoral linkages between food, water, and energy can more effectively minimise trade-offs and maximise synergies across concurrent efforts to improve water, energy, food, and nutrition security sustainably. © The Pakistan Development Review.",Not About Sufficiency
Water: the stuff of life.,"This article discusses the relationship between human settlements and the water cycle. Water is a finite resource that supports daily human life, is required for food production, and is necessary for waste removal. Water quality has declined under the strains of increasing population and pollution. Human survival depends upon reducing risks and safeguarding water supplies that are crucial to survival. Contaminated water supplies lead to sickness and death. Maintaining urban water quality means maintaining the water supply system. High internal pipe pressure means leakage to the outside. When water systems are partially full, the internal pipe pressure lowers and creates susceptibility to in-leakage. If cracked sewage pipes lie in contaminated areas, the risk of waterborne diseases is increased. Groundwater is the main source of water in many dry climates. Demand for water can outstrip the supply of groundwater. Poor soil management and mismanagement of irrigation systems may result in waterlogging and salinization. The global water cycle replenishes the supply in the ground. Water is lost through evaporation and in biomass production and is returned through rainfall. Surplus water collects in aquifers and rivers. Sustainable development requires thinking about what can be changed including types of governments, technical solutions, citizen education, lifestyles, and expectations. Flexibility and cooperation between sectors is important for successful management of water resources. Many communities are developing Local Government Action Plans, as called for in the 1992 Rio Earth Summit's Local Agenda 21, Chapter 28.",Not About Sufficiency

Comparative analysis of egyptian water policies,"As the beginning of the 21st century nears, the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources of Egypt (MPWWR) is working toward developing its water strategy to satisfy pressing future requirements. Although until now MPWWR has been successful in satisfying the different economic sectors' requirements, a recent analysis indicates a very critical situation regarding the match between available water and requirements. Currently the per capita share of the Nile water is very close to the minimum threshold. With rapid population growth, it will decrease signtjicantly in the next twenty years. Accordingly, water will be a constraint for any development, especially in the agriculture sector Economics and sociopolitics will be the decisive factors in allocating water among the sector requirements. This article discusses and analyzes previous Egyptian water policies. A comparison between past, current, and projected water policies is presented. Contradictions among some numbers, and changes in the assumptions used in these policies are pointed out. A conceptual framework that should be followed to design the water strategy for the next century is introduced as an alternative to the traditional scheme. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
"Analyzing the dynamics influencing artisanal and small-scale mining in the Upper Denkyira East Municipality, Ghana","The gold mining sector in Ghana has significantly contributed to the nation's economic expansion by creating various employment prospects, both directly and indirectly, within mining communities. However, it is important to acknowledge that this industry has also had adverse environmental consequences. A sample size of 330 individuals, comprising small-scale miners and farmers, was randomly selected from 10 mining communities within the Upper Denkyira Municipality to examine factors influencing artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) operations. Furthermore, 150 key informants, comprising representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forestry Commission, the Mineral Commission, and other stakeholders, were also interviewed to ascertain the impact of mining on the environment. The research employed a logic regression model, the weighted average index (WAI), and X-ray fluorescence as a method for the study data analysis. The study determined that low income, the impact of climate change on agriculture, and the high demand for gold exhibit a significant chance of influencing ASM. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that ASM have immeasurably contributed to water pollution, food security, and the loss of biodiversity in the municipality. Additionally, water resources, which serve as sources of potable water for drinking and irrigation, are heavily contaminated with arsenic, mercury, lead, copper, and nickel. The study concluded that implementing stricter regulations on mining practices, promoting sustainable mining methodologies, and providing comprehensive training to miners on environmental protection and land rehabilitation can help mitigate the negative impacts of ASM. Additionally, supporting alternative means of livelihood for mining communities, such as agriculture or ecotourism, can reduce the reliance on mining and promote sustainable development. © 2024 United Nations.",Not About Sufficiency
"“Soft, airy fairy stuff”? Re-evaluating 'social impacts’ in gendered processes of natural resource extraction","Within the global extractive industry, emotions continue to the subject of regulation and erasure. In recent years, the dismissal of emotion within much of the extractive sector has been underpinned by particular hegemonic forms of masculinity which position emotions as ‘irrational’ and ‘irrelevant’. The ramifications for the way in which this form of masculinity dismisses and erases emotion have been critiqued primarily within the context of those working within the sector (Mayes and Pini 2010, 2014; Pini et al 2010). However, this intervention has yet to take place to the same extent for those outside the sector, who are navigating its consequences for their communities and places. This paper argues that dismissing emotion has particular implications for the ways in which 'social impact assessments’ are conducted, and for what is counted or classified as a 'social impact’ by the sector. Drawing on women's experiences of opposition to the development of extractive projects throughout the New South Wales (NSW) Hunter Valley, this paper uses emotional geographies to emphasise the ways in which the masculinist regulation and erasure of emotion within the extractive sector also facilitates the dismissal of the distinctly emotional consequences of resource extraction for people and place. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Investing in sustainable catchments,"Catchments constitute logical units for management of the water cycle. Patterns of development uninformed by sustainability concerns have degraded catchment integrity and associated ecosystem functions, imposing largely unquantified costs. Ecosystem functions are central to sustainable social and economic progress; their protection or restoration may be the only sustainable form of investment in catchments. Despite growing use of catchment functions in some policy areas, a shortfall in awareness and pragmatic tools limits progress with policies and practical tools to support sustainable development in catchments, perpetuating damaging practices. This paper reviews methods of economic valuation of riverine systems. Valuation of ecosystem functions is revealed as particularly pertinent to sustainable development, as an indicator of the benefits of ecological processes to social and economic progress. A range of practical projects, targeted at restoration of riverine habitat in the UK with the intent of improving both river ecology and the social and economic advantages that flow from it, is also reviewed. Emerging principles and themes are discussed in terms of their potential contribution to policies and practices that promote sustainability. Review of these projects highlights the importance of planning at adequately broad scales - spatial, temporal and disciplinary - to identify integrated solutions, and to maximise community 'buy-in' and total benefits. In several cases, economic analyses demonstrate strongly positive benefit-cost ratios stemming from habitat improvement. However, major reform of regulatory and economic instruments is needed to promote sustainable catchment development, since prevalent 'perverse' incentives continue to degrade ecosystem functions. Measures to recognise and reward ecosystem service as legitimate outputs from agricultural land use constitute a particular priority. There is a need simultaneously to address both 'big picture' structural adjustments and locally-appropriate solutions, from which clear local benefits flow. Pragmatic measures that contribute to systemic outcomes must also be attractive to local decision-makers and land managers, and yield benefits that ensure they are sustained once intervention ceases. Cost need not be a barrier, as current environmentally-damaging subsidies may instead be redirected towards sensitive land use and/or measures to protect biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, particularly where targeted upon habitat of disproportionate importance to functioning of catchments as whole systems. Internalisation of the costs of damage to ecosystem functioning will promote valuation of the natural capital of catchments as a primary resource for social and economic progress. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Health and security in the global village.,"With the ecological stability of the world under threat, no country can stand alone. National security should no longer be viewed in a purely military light but rather as a matter demanding cooperation between all countries on a broad range of vital issues, not least those related to health and the environment.; During the 19th century, health care was introduced not for humanitarian reasons but because industrialists realized that healthy workers were more cost-effective than unhealthy ones. Health practitioners and political scientists now agree on the desirability of removing inequities in health care, particularly in the setting of north/south relations. Yet unless health-for-all goals impinge directly on national interests, they are likely to remain unfulfilled. In the 1990s, however, national security is no longer just a perceived capacity for retaliation but is a process reflecting a much wider view of threat. The nuclear menace still exists, but, when focusing on interdependence, the security issue begins to look different. People face many hazards, among them AIDS, drugs, pollution, starvation, population growth, and environmental degradation, which fail to appear in traditional analyses. The central dominance of military power in security issues has been challenged. Nature does not recognize international boundaries. Thus, paralleling developments in social medicine, the new strategic approach is to embrace the whole picture rather than isolated parts. Security, as defined 1982 by the Palme Commission on Disarmament and Security, requires physical and economic well-being, human rights, civil and political liberties, a sustainable environment, and a program of social justice seeking the transfer of resources from the north to the south. In strategic or peace studies, threat assessment exercises, which previously focused primarily on economic and military capability, now also cover larger ecological and environmental dangers. The body politic is required to recognize challenges and provide solutions. This involves not merely a multidimensional approach to the concept of national security but also a multidisciplinary effort in both problem identification and efforts to change the perceptions of decision-makers.",Not About Sufficiency
"Rainfall Variability, Hunger, and Social Inequality, and Their Relative Influences on Migration: Evidence from Bangladesh","Research on climate change and migration usually assesses the effects of natural hazards and/or creeping environmental degradation on people’s livelihoods and their migration. This chapter looks at changing rainfall patterns, local perception of these changes, and the decision to migrate, or not, to cope with rainfall variability and hunger. Based on empirical evidence from a case study undertaken in Kurigram District in northern Bangladesh, this chapter addresses four key questions: (1) Is the rural population sensitive to rainfall variability? (2) How is rainfall variability related to food security? (3) Which labour-migration systems can be used by the local people to cope with environmental shocks and adapt to change? and (4) Do people migrate for work to cope with and adapt to the effects of rainfall variability or because of food insecurity and social inequality? Although rainfall variability can play an important role in people’s decisions to migrate, we argue that migration from the region is not driven so much by climate changes as it is by the persistent local patterns of social inequality and food insecurity coupled with the structural economic disparities that exist in Bangladesh. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency

The differences across future teachers regarding attitudes on social responsibility for sustainable development,"In the search for sustainable development, in which the ecological footprint is carefully considered by consumers and companies, teachers play an important role within a social and economic framework. This role relates to aspects of social responsibility. It should involve knowledge about education for responsible consumption in order to care for the environment both individually and socially. Considering this, the aim of this study is to find out whether there are differences in the level of awareness and the habits of future teachers of Early Childhood and Primary Education regarding sustainable social responsibility. A non-probabilistic sample of 30 Early Childhood Education degree students and 22 Primary Education degree students was used. Semi-structured interviews and an inductive process were conducted to examine the importance of Sustainable Development in society, the relevance of Social Responsibility for Sustainable Development (individual versus corporate), the attitudes and habits relative to Sustainable Development and the education on Sustainable Development in schools: knowledge, attitudes, and proposals. Students agree that they consume excessively. This is everyone’s individual responsibility (as regarded by all participants), although changes could be supported by institutions and companies (Early Childhood education students argue in favour of corporate responsibility). Knowledge deficits were identified in relation to production, distribution, and sale processes. They consider education to be the main factor for sustainability, while society is ranked as the least important, observing an evident disagreement in relation to environmental and economic factors (perception of collective responsibility; Early Childhood versus Primary Education students). Finally, they also outline teaching proposals (active and participatory) to foster education for sustainable development at schools. © 2020 by the authors.

FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE: A STUDY ON SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION PRACTICES AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN A REGION OF PERU,"Objective: In recent years, sustainable consumption has been promoted in order to preserve natural resources for present and future generations. In that sense, the objective of this research was to evaluate sustainable consumption practices in university students in the Amazon region of Madre de Dios, Peru. Method: The approach was quantitative, the design was non-experimental and the type, cross-sectional descriptive-comparative. The sample was made up of 357 students who answered the Questionnaire on Socially Responsible Sustainable Consumption Practices, an instrument with adequate levels of validity and reliability. Results: It was found that sustainable consumption practices of 46.8% of the students were not common, 35% were unusual and 18.2% were common. On the other hand, it was determined that sustainable consumption practices and informed purchase dimensions, responsible use, respect for people and animals and quality and territoriality were significantly associated with some sociodemographic variables. Conclusions: It was concluded that sustainable consumption practices in university students were not common, therefore, universities are suggested to implement environmental education in a transverse and integral way to concretize sustainable development objectives. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Local agri-food systems as a cultural heritage strategy to recover the sustainability of local communities. Insights from the spanish case,"One of the factors threatening the sustainability of rural territories is the hegemonic agro-industrial model, whose environmental and social impacts strongly limit rural life. Here, we want to call attention to the opportunities provided by alternative agri-food systems, based on agroecology and food sovereignty, as a cultural heritage to support sustainable local development. We have carried out exploratory research to draft the main agroecological initiatives in Spain, particularly those having explicit support or encouragement from public administrations. An on-line questionnaire (n = 40) was delivered, and in-depth interviews (n = 15) were carried out among a sample of people working in the Spanish agroecology sector (public and private). The results demonstrate how the recovery and promotion of traditional ecological knowledge can help to increase the capacity of the social-ecological systems to cope with shocks and disturbances and maintain long-term resilience. In addition, agroecological practices allow collective identities to emerge around the characteristics of the territory strengthening local life, placing the society-ecosystem coevolution at the center of local identity. In conclusion, although still a minority, we have showed how several types of policies conceiving agroecological practices as an intangible collective heritage, with significant transformative potential towards local sustainability, have already been implemented. © 2021 by the authors.

Understanding Urban Regulating Ecosystem Services in the Global South,"The context of the Global South’s urban ecosystems is often poorly understood or accounted for when applying the Urban Regulating Ecosystem Services (URES) concept, primarily because most available information is from the Global North. Thus, there is a need to better understand the unique socio-economic, political and environmental context of urban areas in the Global South when addressing issues related to urban ecosystem services, environmental quality, climate change and environmental justice. This chapter provides a more nuanced perspective on how URES can address urban environmental and climate change problems, thereby improving the human condition and policy formulation. It first defines URES using selected literature and discusses differences in the environmental and socio-economic characteristics and trajectories of cities in the Global South relative to the Global North. Several global examples overview the effectiveness and relevance of URES in the context of mitigation and adaptation to environmental pollution, extreme climatic events and sustainable development. Future research needs and environmental policy implications are also discussed. It concludes by emphasising the need for more interconnected and equal cooperation and knowledge exchange between Global North and South countries, when applying and studying URES concepts and practices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Typology of small producers in transition to agroecological production,"Agroecology is now emerging as the fundamental science to guide the conversion of conventional production systems to more diversified and self-sufficient systems. The agroecological transition is defined as the gradual change that farmers undergo to adapt and move from more conventional towards agroecological farming principles, encompassing technological, societal, institutional and organisational changes in the food system. To analyze a transition process, it is initially necessary to understand how agroecosystems work (their structure and processes), and the different ways human beings intervene an ecosystem in order to transform it for productive purposes.Farm systems typology and classification techniques are used to guide strategic lines of research, sectorial policies, and promote sustainable development in response to farmer’s needs. Determining multidimensional classification methods in agricultural systems is necessary, considering both the variables inherent to the production system and those of an external nature that indirectly impact the development and long-term sustainability of production systems. One of the purposes of this research was to characterize agricultural production based on sustainability systems and environmental, social, and economic indicators. The study was carried out based on data collected from 71 farm surveys, considering the social, economic, environmental, and technological dimensions. Multiple correspondence and cluster analysis were done. Three types of production systems were obtained: Group I, organic producers in transition; Group II, conventional producers in transition to organic production; and Group III, conventional producers interested in organic production. Producers need to focus on processes that allow them to improve their skills to develop human talent and social capital in terms of integration, collaborative work, trust, political and cultural capital, so that they can make progress easily and start implementing agroecological, infrastructure, and natural resources management practices, while improving their living standards. The information yielded by a typology process allows for us to know the current state of agricultural production systems based on the implementation of agroecological practices; thus facilitating the preparation and implementation of participatory plans and/or integrative proposals that promote agrofood sustainability. © 2019, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

For example, for Γ12 (d, c) = (−9.45, 74.96)*, the total payoff is 65.71 (74.96–9.45); for Γ12 (d, d) = (−8.44, 73.95), the total outcome is 65.71. For the others, Γ12 (c, c) leads to the outcome of 32.41 and Γ12 (c, d) also leads to 32.41. Thus, issue linkage will give more opportunities for the countries in the negotiation process. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental and social impacts of carbon sequestration,"Climate change requires major mitigation efforts, mainly emission reduction. Carbon sequestration and avoided deforestation are complementary mitigation strategies that can promote nature conservation and local development but may also have undesirable impacts. We reviewed 246 articles citing impacts, risks, or concerns from carbon projects, and 78 others related to this topic. Most of the impacts cited focus on biodiversity, especially in afforestation projects, and on social effects related to avoided deforestation projects. Concerns were raised about project effectiveness, the permanence of carbon stored, and leakage. Recommendations include accounting for uncertainty, assessing both mitigation and contribution to climate change, defining permanence, creating contingency plans, promoting local projects, proposing alternative livelihoods, ensuring a fair distribution of benefits, combining timber production and carbon sequestration, ensuring sustainable development and minimizing leakage. A holistic approach that combines carbon sequestration, nature conservation, and poverty alleviation must be applied. The potential occurrence of negative impacts does not invalidate carbon projects but makes it advisable to conduct proper environmental impact assessments, considering direct and indirect impacts, minimizing the negative effects while maximizing the positive ones, and weighing the trade-offs between them to guide decision-making.

Water and food insecurity & quality of life for deaf Nigerians: A community-based cross sectional study,"Drought and flooding caused by climate change as well as regional and global conflicts mean that access to both water and food is becoming increasingly precarious worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Deaf and disabled people worldwide have historically struggled to access basic needs, including access to nutritious food, sanitation and clean, potable water. Access to clean water and food is a daily challenge for many Nigerians, particularly in the northern regions. Our first-of-its kind exploratory study of 150 deaf Nigerians reports findings from a cross-sectional survey involving deaf Nigerians about their access to these essential resources. Our study, led by a joint team of deaf American and deaf Nigerian scholars, sheds light on deaf Nigerians’ diverse experiences accessing food, sanitation and potable water. We applied two logistic regression models to our data with having enough food and access to clean water as separate outcomes. Findings indicate that quality of life with respect to physical health is associated both with having access to clean water and having enough to eat. We discuss these findings in the context of geopolitical and social hurdles that deaf Nigerians face, including a lack of educational and employment advantages. © 2025 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Payments for environmental services to promote “climate-smart agriculture”? Potential and challenges,"Payments for environmental services (PES) have gained wide popularity as approaches to promote environmentally friendly land use or agricultural production practices. Yet academics have also voiced concerns against seeing PES as a panacea. This article discusses whether PES is an appropriate and promising approach to promote so-called “climate-smart agriculture” (CSA) practices, which we define as agricultural production practices that contribute to CO2 emission reductions and/or removals and provide benefits to farmers via increased productivity and profits and reduced vulnerability to climate change. PES appears most promising for the promotion of CSA practices in small-scale farming contexts with low incomes. Effective design, however, requires solid estimates of cost and benefit flows from CSA adoption over time, accounting for differences in socioeconomic and ecological conditions, and addressing the risk of leakage. Funding for such PES will likely have to come from public sources, and seems most promising where synergies with other objectives such as agricultural development, food security, and climate adaptation or other environmental services exist. The potential of alternative approaches for CSA support such as taxation with rebates for CSA practices, CSA-related investment support such as microcredits, and hybrid approaches such as conditional microcredit should be further investigated. © 2016 International Association of Agricultural Economists",Not About Sufficiency
A robust multiple-objective decision-making paradigm based on the water–energy–food security nexus under changing climate uncertainties,"From the perspective of the water–energy–food (WEF) security nexus, sustainable water-related infrastructure may hinge on multi-dimensional decision-making, which is subject to some level of uncertainties imposed by internal or external sources such as climate change. It is important to note that the impact of this phenomenon is not solely limited to the changing behavior patterns of hydro-climatic variables since it can also affect the other pillars of the WEF nexus both directly and indirectly. Failing to address these issues can be costly, especially for those projects with long-lasting economic lifetimes such as hydropower systems. Ideally, a robust plan can tolerate these projected changes in climatic behavior and their associated impacts on other sectors, while maintaining an acceptable performance concerning environmental, socio-economic, and technical factors. This study, thus, aims to develop a robust multiple-objective decision-support framework to address these concerns. In principle, while this framework is sensitive to the uncertainties associated with the climate change projections, it can account for the intricacies that are commonly associated with the WEF security network. To demonstrate the applicability of this new framework, the Karkheh River basin in Iran was selected as a case study due to its critical role in ensuring water, energy, and food security of the region. In addition to the status quo, a series of climate change projections (i.e., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5) were integrated into the proposed decision support framework as well. Resultantly, the mega decision matrix for this problem was composed of 56 evaluation criteria and 27 feasible alternatives. A TOPSIS/Entropy method was used to select the most robust renovation plan for a hydropower system in the basin by creating a robust and objective weighting mechanism to quantify the role of each sector in the decision-making process. Accordingly, in this case, the energy, food, and environment sectors are objectively more involved in the decision-making process. The results revealed that the role of the social aspect is practically negligible. The results also unveiled that while increasing the power plant capacity or the plant factor would be, seemingly, in favor of the energy sector, if all relevant factors are to be considered, the overall performance of the system might resultantly become sub-optimal, jeopardizing the security of other aspects of the water–energy–food nexus. © 2021, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Income inequality and violent crime: Evidence from Mexico's drug war,"The goal of this paper is to examine the effect of inequality on crime rates in a unique context, Mexico's drug war. The analysis exploits an original dataset containing inequality and crime statistics on more than 2000 Mexican municipalities over a 20-year period. To uncover the causal effect of inequality on crime, we use an instrumental variable for the Gini coefficient that combines the initial income distribution at the municipality level with national trends. Our estimates indicate that a one-point increment in the Gini coefficient between 2007 and 2010 translates into an increase of more that 36% in the number of drug-related homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. The fact that the effect found during the drug war is substantially greater is likely caused by the rise in rents to be extracted through crime and an expansion in the employment opportunities in the illegal sector through the proliferation of drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), accompanied by a decline in legal job opportunities and a reduction in the probability of being caught given the resource constraints faced by the law enforcement system. Combined, the latter factors made the expected benefits of criminal activity shift in a socially undesirable direction after 2007.Sector Board: Poverty (POV). © 2016 .",Not About Sufficiency
ENHANCING SAFFLOWER PRODUCTION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVING INCOMES OF SMALL-SCALE FARMERS IN BOTSWANA,"Safflower is a multipurpose crop cultivated in the arid and semi-arid lands of the world. The crop is underutilized, and minor compared to other oilseed crops despite its excellent adaptability to various climatic conditions including drought, salinity, and extreme temperature tolerance. The seeds contain essential fatty acids beneficial to human health. Safflower has a high potential to be an industrial crop for the food, pharmaceutical, livestock feed, textile, and ornamental industries. The objective of this CARP project was to enhance safflower production and product development in Botswana with the goal to mitigate the effects of climate change, improve food security and incomes of farmers, reduce hunger, food imports, and poverty in Botswana. The project has established the optimum plant density that maximizes seed and oil yield and fatty acid composition; the influence of genotypes on seed yield and phenological stages; nutritional content of whole seed and forage for animal feed; nitrogen and phosphorus nutritional requirements; and potential insect pests and beneficial insects of safflower. The project strengthened links between the university and TVET institution, farmers, researchers, extension staff, other universities, farmer co-ops, and other research institutions in Botswana. The project has built capacity in agricultural research through the training of professional staff. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Anthony Egeru, Megan Lindow and Kay Muir Leresche; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Modelling climatic water balance for water stress-detection for select crops under climate variability in the Sudano-Guinean Savanna, Nigeria","Climate change is a threat to food security with Sub-Saharan Africa being one of the most vulnerable regions and so requires concerted effort for efficient water conservation to boost food production. This effort should come from researchers, States and all other stakeholders especially given that agriculture in the region is still mostly rain-fed. The study employed the Thornthwaite evapotranspiration model to evaluate the climatic water balance in the Sudano-Guinean zone of Nigeria. The assessment of the crop water stress was utilised to design annual multiple cropping systems involving fast maturing and heat-tolerant select crops. Incorporating apt water conservation and prudent agricultural planning, the crops can be grown twice to three times per annum. The intensive multiple cropping systems of agriculture will avert the extensive agricultural practice that requires much land size with its attendant land degradation. It also will lead to higher productivity. The study reveals variability in climate observed in changes in temperature, rainfall and climatic water balance. However, the footprint is higher in Zaria and Kaduna. As a result, Zaria demands special attention due to the higher nature of its water stress and increased evapotranspiration. Therefore, conservation measures should be incorporated in agricultural practices of the zone especially in Zaria. The study advanced recommendations that will help to boost agricultural productivity in the Savanna zone of Nigeria. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Gender Equality and Inclusive Growth,"This chapter examines growth as a gendered process, distinguishing the spheres of production, social reproduction and finance. It discusses how inclusion in growth can be harmful rather than enhancing well-being, and notes that economic growth frequently has adverse side effects, such as depletion of human and natural resources. It considers what a gender-equitable inclusive growth process would look like and discusses gender-equitable strategies for recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. It concludes by highlighting the need for new forms of economic growth, focusing on public investment in social as well as physical infrastructure, and on enjoyment of decent work not mere participation in the labour force. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
"Role of compost, biochar and sugar alcohols in raising the maize tolerance to water deficit conditions","N OW, people in Egypt are under the water poverty limit a long time ago due to climate change and the shortage of water resources. These conditions hamper agricultural development in Egypt. Thus, a practical solution must be undertaken for confronting the water scarcity that hindered agricultural development in Egypt. So, two field trials were executed to assess three water levels of full irrigation [8000 m3 ha-1 as traditional full irrigation (TFI) treatment followed in the studied area (100% of TFI), 6000 m3 ha-1 (75% of TFI) and 4000 m3 ha-1 (50 % of TFI)] as main plots. While different soil conditioners [without (control), biochar (at rate of 24 Mg ha-1) and plant compost (at rate of 24 Mg ha-1) in addition to both of them as combined treatment (at rate of 12 Mg ha-1 for each conditioner),1.0 Mg ʺmega gramʺ=106 g i.e., metric ton] were evaluated as subplots. Also, the foliar application of glycerol and sorbitol (0.0 and 500 mM L-1) represented the sub-sub plots. Maize was used as an experimental plant. Findings illustrate that treatments of 75 and 50 % of TFI led to a raise in the enzymatic antioxidants production after 60 days from sowing. While both soil conditioners (either solely or in combination) and the sugar alcohols led to a decline the values of these enzymatic antioxidants. On the contrary, at the period of 90 days from sowing (growth advanced stage), the grown plants without the studied substances (soil conditioners and sugar alcohols) cannot continue producing these enzymatic antioxidants under water deficit treatments. Also, the deficit irrigation (75 and 50 % of TFI) caused a significant decline in the performance and productivity of maize compared to traditional irrigation (100 % of TFI). For example, the highest values of fresh weight (951.64 and 965.61 g plant-1, for 1st and 2nd seasons, respectively), leaf area (620.25 and 628.56 cm2 plant-1, for 1st and 2nd seasons, respectively) and chlorophyll content (40.55 and 41.42 SPAD for 1st and 2nd seasons, respectively) were realized under traditional irrigation (100 % of TFI) followed by those values achieved under deficit irrigation treatment (75 % of TFI), while the lowest one was recorded with 50 % of TFI treatment. Regarding the soil conditioners effect, the compost and biochar either solely or in combination improved the plant performance and productivity compared to the corresponding plants grown without soil conditioners. The highest values of growth criteria and productivity were realized with the combined treatment of compost and biochar followed by compost alone then biochar alone and lately control. Concerning sugar alcohols, the sorbitol was the superior, while the glycerol came in the second order and lately control treatment. Generally, it can be concluded that a combination of compost and biochar may hold enough amounts of irrigation water and nutrients and release them as required by the maize plant, thus enhancing plant growth performance with the limited supply of irrigation water. Also, sugar alcohols have a vital role in raising maize tolerance to water deficit conditions. © 2023 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).",Not About Sufficiency
Is Nano-Biofortification the Right Approach for Malnutrition in the Era of COVID-19 and Climate change?,"HUMAN health may depend on the environment and its compartments, which may include climatic factors. These climatic factors and their changes might impact on human health particularly the outbreak of pandemics like COVID-19. The combined stress resulted from climate changes and COVID-19 could be noticed in several countries especially in the developing countries. Malnutrition is considered one of the most important problems in the developing countries in particular under the droughts, flooding, and other climatic events. Malnutrition was aggravated under COVID-19 outbreak in these countries due to the closure of borders between countries, the crisis of global trade, and the global food insecurity. The biofortification process is the sustainable solution to overcome malnutrition, which included very recently using nano-nutrients as called nano-biofortification. The approach of nano-biofortification is a promising tool in producing biofortified edible plants, otherwise this tool still needs more studies to answer the open questions like which nano-nutrients can be used in nano-biofortification?

Agronomic aspects and environmental impact of reusing marginal water in irrigation: A case study from Egypt,"Egypt produces approximately 2.4 million m3 of secondary treated wastewater (TWW) annually, used for irrigation directly or indirectly by blending with agricultural drainage water (BDW). The annual re-use of (BDW) is approximately 4 million m3. The safe and efficient use of marginal water (BDW and TWW) is a core objective of this study which has been operating from 1997 to date. After six growing seasons the main results can be summarized as follows: Maximizing crop production: TWW c an be used for high production of oil crops (canola, soybean sunflower or maize) compared to fresh water, while BDW can be used for high production of tolerant crops (cotton and sugar beet). Crop quality: using marginal water increases the concentration of elements (Pb, B, Ni, Co) in all crops but these elements were under critical levels (there were no toxicity hazards). It is better to use alternative irrigation with fresh water under a drip irrigation system to maximise crop production and minimise the adverse effects of such water in field crops quality. Soil pollution and salinity build up: A drip irrigation system under alternative irrigation by fresh with TWW or BDW reduces salinity build up risks and the levels of elements (Pb, B, Ni, Co) in soil compared to re-use marginal water. Soil pathogens: using marginal water slightly contaminated the soil with total faecal coliform (TFC), mites, shigella and salmonella Plant anatomy: No great changes in anatomical disturbance where induced in different structures of plants which were reduced at maturity stage. Primary guidelines for re-using marginal water: From obtained results i t can be recommended to use marginal water with salinity content ranged between 1.1 to 3. 64 dS/m, and elemental contents (Pb 3.0-3.51 ppm), (B 0.05-1.67 ppm), (Co 0.04-0.07 ppm), (Ni 0.08-0.15 ppm) for safe (field, vegetable and medicinal) crops production. Reuse bio solids for crop production: Sewage sludge produced from treated wastewater can be safely used by mixing with rice straw (1:1 w/w) for economic crop production and saving mineral fertilisers. General conclusion: In the North Nile Delta, marginal water (especially BDW) can be safely used without significant negative impact on the environment, but there is a need for multi-disciplinary, long-term research to investigate irrigation with marginal water in terms of the environment, public health and agricultural productivity. © IWA Publishing 2006.",Not About Sufficiency
"Our Common Home: Climate Shocks, Educational Outcomes, and Education for Sustainable Development in Africa","Pope Francis has made the protection of our common home a central theme of his Papacy. This may be nowhere more important than in Africa, a continent that is already today highly vulnerable to climate shocks due in part to high levels of water stress in many countries, food insecurity, and forced displacement, among others. In this paper, we use household surveys from West African countries to explore the impact of covariate shocks (most of which are weather-related) and international migration as a potential response to shocks on educational outcomes for children of primary school age. The results suggest that shocks affect educational outcomes substantially, but that international migration may generate benefits for children of migrants. The paper also briefly discusses policy prescriptions on how to tackle climate change, arguing that education to sustainable development should be a priority. © 2023 Institute for Global Engagement.",Not About Sufficiency
Desalination Process via Pervaporation of Wetland Saline Water,"Water is a very important resource for life on earth. Nowadays, water scarcity is a big issue around the world. Especially people who live in wetland areas, river is an important water source for their daily life. Unfortunately, the water becomes salty due to seawater intrusion into the river. The objective of this work is to apply desalination via pervaporation process of wetland saline water using pure silica membranes employ TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate) as a precursor. A two-step acid-base catalysed method has been applied to produce silica sols. The pure silica membranes were calcined under RTP (Rapid Thermal Process) method at 600°C for 1 hour. The various temperatures (20, 40 & 60 °C have been set in pervaporation set up in order to investigate the performance of silica membranes.

“And DPSIR begat DAPSI(W)R(M)!” - A unifying framework for marine environmental management,"The marine environment is a complex system formed by interactions between ecological structure and functioning, physico-chemical processes and socio-economic systems. An increase in competing marine uses and users requires a holistic approach to marine management which considers the environmental, economic and societal impacts of all activities. If managed sustainably, the marine environment will deliver a range of ecosystem services which lead to benefits for society. In order to understand the complexity of the system, the DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) approach has long been a valuable problem-structuring framework used to assess the causes, consequences and responses to change in a holistic way. Despite DPSIR being used for a long time, there is still confusion over the definition of its terms and so to be appropriate for current marine management, we contend that this confusion needs to be addressed. Our viewpoint advocates that DPSIR should be extended to DAPSI(W)R(M) (pronounced dap-see-worm) in which Drivers of basic human needs require Activities which lead to Pressures. The Pressures are the mechanisms of State change on the natural system which then leads to Impacts (on human Welfare). Those then require Responses (as Measures). Furthermore, because of the complexity of any managed sea area in terms of multiple Activities, there is the need for a linked-DAPSI(W)R(M) framework, and then the connectivity between marine ecosystems and ecosystems in the catchment and further at sea, requires an interlinked, nested-DAPSI(W)R(M) framework to reflect the continuum between adjacent ecosystems. Finally, the unifying framework for integrated marine management is completed by encompassing ecosystem structure and functioning, ecosystem services and societal benefits. Hence, DAPSI(W)R(M) links the socio-ecological system of the effects of changes to the natural system on the human uses and benefits of the marine system. However, to deliver these sustainably in the light of human activities requires a Risk Assessment and Risk Management framework; the ISO-compliant Bow-Tie method is used here as an example. Finally, to secure ecosystem health and economic benefits such as Blue Growth, successful, adaptive and sustainable marine management Responses (as Measures) are delivered using the 10-tenets, a set of facets covering all management disciplines and approaches. © 2017 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Challenging paradigms in estuarine ecology and management,"For many years, estuarine science has been the 'poor relation' in aquatic research - freshwater scientists ignored estuaries as they tended to get confused by salt and tides, and marine scientists were more preoccupied by large open systems. Estuaries were merely regarded by each group as either river mouths or sea inlets respectively. For the past four decades, however, estuaries (and other transitional waters) have been regarded as being ecosystems in their own right. Although often not termed as such, this has led to paradigms being generated to summarise estuarine structure and functioning and which relate to both the natural science and management of these systems. This paper defines, details and affirms these paradigms that can be grouped into those covering firstly the science (definitions, scales, linkages, productivity, tolerances and variability) and secondly the management (pressures, valuation, health and services) of estuaries. The more 'science' orientated paradigms incorporate the development and types of ecotones, the nature of stressed and variable systems (with specific reference to resilience and redundancy), the relationship between generalists and specialists produced by environmental tolerance, the relevance of scale in relation to functioning and connectivity, the sources of production and degree of productivity, the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning and the stress-subsidy debates. The more 'management' targeted paradigms include the development and effects of exogenic unmanaged pressures and endogenic managed pressures, the perception of health and the ability to manage estuaries (related to internal and external influences), and the influence of all of these on the production of ecosystem services and societal benefits. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Managing conflicts arising from fisheries enhancements based on non-native fishes in southern Africa,"Southern Africa has a long history of non-native fish introductions for the enhancement of recreational and commercial fisheries, due to a perceived lack of suitable native species. This has resulted in some important inland fisheries being based on non-native fishes. Regionally, these introductions are predominantly not benign, and non-native fishes are considered one of the main threats to aquatic biodiversity because they affect native biota through predation, competition, habitat alteration, disease transfer and hybridization. To achieve national policy objectives of economic development, food security and poverty eradication, countries are increasingly looking towards inland fisheries as vehicles for development. As a result, conflicts have developed between economic and conservation objectives. In South Africa, as is the case for other invasive biota, the control and management of non-native fishes is included in the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act. Implementation measures include import and movement controls and, more recently, non-native fish eradication in conservation priority areas. Management actions are, however, complicated because many non-native fishes are important components in recreational and subsistence fisheries that contribute towards regional economies and food security. In other southern African countries, little attention has focussed on issues and management of non-native fishes, and this is cause for concern. This paper provides an overview of introductions, impacts and fisheries in southern Africa with emphasis on existing and evolving legislation, conflicts, implementation strategies and the sometimes innovative approaches that have been used to prioritize conservation areas and manage non-native fishes. © 2014 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of biostimulants based amino acids and irrigation frequency on agro-physiological characteristics and productivity of broccoli plants,"Abstract scientists are concerned about the utilizing of biostimulants-based amino acids in plant feeding and mitigating negative effects of water stress. As a result, two-year field experiments were conducted at Faculty of Agriculture's experimental station at Cairo University to study the effectiveness of liquid yeast waste (CMS) and Cargo amino acids (AAs) on the agro-physiological features of broccoli plants with different irrigation frequencies (every 5, 10, and 15 days). Compared with control plants, the foliar application of AAs and CMS significantly increased plant height, photosynthesis pigments, head weight, head diameter, head height, plant yield, and quality at different irrigation frequencies. Likewise, both treatments (CMS and AAs) significantly improved ascorbic acids by 16.65% and 15.95% and increased total phenol content by 24.10% and 36.60%, respectively, compared to control plants. Accordingly, the highest productivity was achieved for broccoli grown under irrigation every five days with the CMS bio-stimulant, where it was 3111.17 kg ha-1, while the lowest productivity was achieved for the control treatment in which no biostimulants were added and irrigation frequency every 15 days, and the productivity was 1376.22 kg ha-1. Plants irrigated every 15 days produced the highest levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), followed by plants irrigated every 10 days and every 5 days. Exogenous application of amino acids bio-stimulants could be suggested to improve vegetative growth, biochemical characteristics, productivity, and nutritional value as well as to mitigate negative effects of water scarcity. © Articles by the authors; Licensee UASVM and SHST, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.

The impact of urban sprawl on the heritage areas through the urban fabric of cities,"Historical sites are the economic, cultural and social drivers for a dynamic and sustainable environment. They constitute an integral part of nations' history, identity and regional diversity. Small and medium-sized historical sites with their outstanding built cultural heritage strongly shape the urban landscapes and form the backbone for a balanced and polycentric settlement structure. Historical sites face many challenges, like accelerating globalization, structural, social and demographic changes as well as environmental problems and urban growth. As urban growth is a double faced process it is the concentration of population in urban areas due to supplied services that are missing in rural areas, at the same time it is a decline of socio-economic areas agglomerations. This increase in population happens due to the concentration of economic activity, which is an important determinant, and the result of urbanization. This results in introducing unbalanced trends which destroys human cohesion and builds social exclusion in cities and regions. Through urbanization, people ignore their identities and traditions seeking adequate services and a better lifestyle leading to the disappearance of existing urban fabric that creates an undefined urban pattern. The right balance between restoring and preserving unique cultural heritage has to be set to enable futureproof urban development. Urban growth affects the efficiency of production and economic growth, and the way agents interact and live in cities. Understanding its implications and causes has captured the interest of economists, architects and urban planners in the past and deserves to continue doing so in the future. The research aims to extract a set of urban guidelines to cope with the development process with respect to the identity and character of the place and tohighlight the importance of historical sites, which creates job opportunities, and help to raise the socio-economic level of the society. © 2011 WIT Press.",Not About Sufficiency
Dilemma of mining: Economic development and ecological risks,"This study aims to look at the anthropocentric and ecocentric ethical debate in viewing environmental degradation that occurs. Sustainable development is expected to be a solution to environmental degradation and human interests, but ongoing development does not have a significant improvement in environmental conditions. Based on the results of research conducted on communities around the South Sulawesi mine, the conception of development to meet human needs is then faced with the reality of natural damage that has the potential to threaten the sustainability of human life. Therefore, ecocentric ethics arises with the offer of equilibrium development or zero growth because, growth and distribution of human population will certainly have an impact on the environment, so environmental degradation can only be resolved through this concept but at the same time it will bring consequences to the meaning of the sustainability of development itself which still needs growth as an important thing in meeting the increasing human needs. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Modelling Climate Uncertainty and Adaptations for Soybean-Based Cropping System,"Climate uncertainty is a serious risk to agriculture sector impacting food security. Soybean crop is not exception to climate change. Crop growth simulation modelling approach has been established as a valuable tool to determine climate uncertainty on soybean yield. However, the crop growth model must be calibrated and evaluated for new regions before application for climate change assessment. Limited studies are available about evaluation of CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean model and its application for climate change impact on soybean in spring and autumn seasons under arid conditions. Field experiments were conducted in spring and autumn season in 2019 and 2020 at farmer field in Multan, Pakistan. During spring season experiments, cultivars Williams-82, NARC-1 and Ajmeri were placed in main plots in both seasons, while dates were 10th Jan, 20th Jan, 01st Feb, 10th Feb and 20th Feb during spring season while sowing dates were 01st Jul, 15th Jul, 01st Aug, 15th Aug and 30th Aug in autumn were allocated in sub plots. Results indicated that after calibration, performance of model was well due to acceptable ranged values of error and root mean square error (RMSE). In sensitivity analysis, model was responsive to CO2, temperature and rainfall. Climate change reduced more seed yield in autumn season as compared to spring season. Without adaptation strategies, seed yield will be reduced by 22.73% in spring and 35.91% in autumn season during mid-century at all GCMs at RCP 8.5. With adopting adaptation strategies of seven days earlier sowing of spring soybean and ten days delay sowing of autumn crop, along with growing climate resilient cultivars can minimize the negative impact of climate change. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency

Potential of suspended growth biological processes for mixed wastewater reclamation and reuse in agriculture: challenges and opportunities,"Pollution and increasing water demand, especially for agriculture, put severe stress on freshwater sources, and as a result, there is progressive deficit in the global water supply and severe water scarcity is projected in the coming decades. Discharges from domestic, industrial and agricultural activities are potential sources of water pollution, impacting human and environmental health. In the face of growing water scarcity and droughts, coupled with the increasing water demand for irrigation, integration of high water-volume and nutrient-rich industrial effluents, into the existing water management plans for agriculture, could play an important role in tackling the problem of water scarcity. However, there is a gap in knowledge about integration of industrial effluents to sewage treatments and the reuse potential of biologically treated mixed industrial and domestic wastewater in agriculture. This study, therefore, provides a critical review on biological treatment of industrial effluents, including petroleum, textile and pharmaceutical wastewater to better understand the capability of bioprocesses and conditions for efficient degradation of pollutants. The effectiveness of activated sludge-based processes, for the treatment of mixed industrial and domestic wastewater, was critically examined, and biomass acclimation plays a vital role in enhanced biodegradation performance. Finally, the reuse potential of mixed industrial and domestic wastewaters for crop irrigation was assessed by studying the reuse outcomes in different cases where industrial effluents were utilized for crop production. Management practices, such as cultivation of salt- and metal-tolerant crops, blending and dilution of industrial wastewater with freshwater and sewage, could make industrial effluents valuable for irrigation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of suspended growth biological process for treatment and reuse of mixed wastewater for irrigation of edible crops under hydroponic conditions,"Due to the increasing freshwater deterioration and demand for irrigation, there is pressing need to reclaim and reuse wastewater for agricultural operations. While this practice is gaining significant traction in developed world, it is quite rare in most developing countries with inadequate or no functional sewerage facilities and treatment systems at both municipal and industrial levels occasioned by high investment and operational costs. Consequently, wastewaters generated are in complex heterogenous mix of industrial, domestic, municipal and agricultural runoff wastewater. Biological technologies which utilize the expertise of microorganisms are considered robust, efficient and economically attractive for treatment of wide range of wastewaters and they have high suitability in developing countries. This work therefore assessed the potential of suspended growth biological process (SGBP) for reclamation and reuse of mixed wastewater composed a mixture of domestic effluent, pharmaceutical, textile, petroleum discharges and agricultural runoff for irrigation of edible crops (lettuce and beets) with plants phenological parameters as measuring indicators. The germination and phenological characteristics of crops were studied in a hydroponic unit under four irrigation regimes: tap water as control, mixed wastewater, SGBP treated wastewater, and tap water mixed with nutrient solution as upper control, for a duration of 45-d. The results proved that the SGBP treated wastewater had no negative impact on germination responses of the seed crops. However, residual recalcitrant compounds caused early stunted growth in plant root systems with resultant limited access to nutrients. Consequently, plant vegetative growth and phenological development as well as chlorophyll production were reduced. In comparison to nutrients supplemented solution, nutrients deficiency and imbalance in treated wastewater contributed to the poor development in irrigated plants. The outcomes of seed germination and plant growth experiments show a positive indication for reuse of mixed wastewater in agriculture. However, there is need for further research to explore the long-term benefits and limitations of reusing such treated wastewater. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Resolving Conflicts between Corporate Cultivation Rights and Indigenous Community Property Rights: A Study of Abandoned Land in Indonesian Palm Oil Plantations,"We discovered a blank point in the study of palm oil conflicts in Indonesia, namely abandoned land. This is critical in determining the ontology of the conflicts that frequently occur between palm oil firms and communities surrounding plantation areas, conflicts that are generated by land rights. We conducted research in the Bengkayang district. Observations, desk studies, and in-depth interviews that we conducted revealed that there were four main factors causing land to be indicated as abandoned in the area of palm oil companies' cultivation rights (HGU). First, inconsistencies and uncertainties in HGU determination procedures, for example, produce challenges and tensions with indigenous groups. Second, data fabrication practices by related parties, including local governments, result in inaccurate information. Third, the lack of formal legal rights over customary land makes maintaining land ownership claims difficult for groups. Fourth, unequal acknowledgment of traditional regions' sovereignty leads to inequity in natural resource management. The phenomenon of abandoned land in this study occurs due to the duality of property rights, which reduces land productivity. The ontological implications of this research concern land development and management, regulatory simplification in maintaining customary land rights, and contemplation of overlapping land rights. This research increases understanding of the dynamics of development and management of abandoned land. © 2024 Society for Innovative Agriculture, University of Agriculture.

Rebalancing the research equation in Africa: Principles and process,"Background Many examples of research excellence in Africa have been driven by partnerships led by the global North and have involved localised infrastructure improvements to support the best of international research practice. Objective In this article, we explore a possible mechanism by which local research networks, appropriately governed, could begin to support national African research programmes by allying research delivery to clinical service. Summary This article explores the concept that sustainable research effort needs a well-trained and mentored workforce, working to common standards, but which is practically supported by a much developed information technology (IT) infrastructure throughout the continent. Conclusions The balance of investment and ownership of such a research programme needs to be shared between local and international funding, with the emphasis on developing global South-South collaborations and research strategies which address the environmental impact of medical research activity and mitigate the impact of climate change on African populations. Healthcare must be embedded in the post-COVID-19 approach to research development. © Authors 2022",Not About Sufficiency
Feeding a city – Leicester as a case study of the importance of allotments for horticultural production in the UK,"The process of urbanization has detached a large proportion of the global population from involvement with food production. However, there has been a resurgence in interest in urban agriculture and there is widespread recognition by policy-makers of its potential contribution to food security. Despite this, there is little data on urban agricultural production by non-commercial small-scale growers. We combine citizen science data for self-provisioning crop yields with field-mapping and GIS-based analysis of allotments in Leicester, UK, to provide an estimate of allotment fruit and vegetable production at a city-scale. In addition, we examine city-scale changes in allotment land provision on potential crop production over the past century. The average area of individual allotment plots used to grow crops was 52%. Per unit area yields for the majority of crops grown in allotments were similar to those of UK commercial horticulture. We estimate city-wide allotment production of >1200 t of fruit and vegetables and 200 t of potatoes per annum, equivalent to feeding >8500 people. If the 13% of plots that are completely uncultivated were used this could increase production to >1400 t per annum, feeding ~10,000 people, however this production may not be located in areas where there is greatest need for increased access to fresh fruits and vegetables. The citywide contribution of allotment cultivation peaked in the 1950s when 475 ha of land was allotments, compared to 97 ha currently. This suggests a decline from >45,000 to <10,000 of people fed per annum. We demonstrate that urban allotments make a small but important contribution to the fruit and vegetable diet of a UK city. However, further urban population expansion will exert increasing development pressure on allotment land. Policy-makers should both protect allotments within cities, and embed urban agricultural land within future developments to improve local food security. © 2019 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

Uncomfortable knowledge: Mechanisms of urban development in adaptation governance,"Urban economic development is one of the primary engines of hazard exposure and differential social vulnerability, nevertheless, the drivers of urban development are rarely explicitly tackled in work on climate adaptation or resilience governance. When the imperative of urban economic and spatial growth is taken as a given, the mechanisms that perpetuate it remain unexplored and unquestioned. Lack of attention to such mechanisms, and specifically the politics of urban land use, can lead to ineffective planning and maladaptation. In this review, we explore the intersection of scholarship on urban climate adaptation governance and the political economy of urban development to identify the specific contemporary mechanisms that perpetuate uneven patterns of urban vulnerability and undermine adaptation planning. We are guided by three questions: What are the mechanisms that urban managers employ to assign rights and responsibilities to land, and thus allocate spatial exposure to risk? How is land implicated in cities’ efforts to finance themselves and their activities, and what are the implications for adaptation? What mechanisms enable urban actors to protect themselves from risk and respond to uncertainty? We emphasize the need to place urban climate governance within the broader political dynamics of urban development for more effective, equitable and ultimately sustainable vulnerability interventions. We find that instruments of urban development are often supporting the prioritization of economic rewards over equitable and just distribution of risk and rights to adaptation benefits. We conclude by highlighting the “uncomfortable knowledge” that if sustainable adaptation is to be achieved, the mechanisms of urban development and associated actors that shape, steer and utilize these instruments for a variety of means and goals, must be made visible and addressed. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Gamified emissions through the wisdom of crowds,"Social awareness of carbon emissions has come to the forefront more than ever within the last five years. The effects of global warming present one of the greatest epistemic environmental threats of our age. While CO2 emissions have returned to slower growth rates, with a pronounced slowdown between 2014 and 2016 in the USA and European Union, the growth in China/India specifically and most developing nations has dominated global trends for the past 20 years. Contributing to the continued growth of CO2 emissions is the implied correlation between higher levels of economic activity and the requisite use of non-renewable resources (e.g. coal, oil and gas) all resulting in more emissions. Much of the contributors to increased CO2 emissions are linked to conversion of raw material into economic outputs specifically for energy with trade openness' creation of movement of goods and services across borders, coupled with modern technologies and managerial philosophies contributing further. While there has been much social activism regarding the need to create a global plan for CO2 emissions, the degree of traction remains relatively negligible. A wide degree of policies, programs and projects aimed at attempting to address global climate change, its drivers and impact have emerged to create the requisite social and institutional conditions to adapt to climate variability, risk and its future impact. The question becomes how to create/increase the requisite positive behaviors needed to enable significant behavioral change regarding carbon emissions. In this chapter, we explore the potential of gamified approaches to incentivize carbon emission reduction with an aim to create sustainable practices. The approach first reviews the current landscape around CO2 and climate change, followed by examples of gamification utilized in behavioral context to increase awareness and an examination of the motivational aspects of gamification, its characteristics and benefits. The chapter closes with proposed approaches to support carbon emission reductions and create sustainable awareness of climate change issues through a conceptual gamification toolkit built on the wisdom of crowds to aid development of a CO2 gamification framework for sustainability and social responsibility. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring Economic Expansion of Green Hydrogen Production in South Africa,"Hydrogen is a crucial energy carrier for the Clean Energy Sustainable Development Goals and the just transition to low/zero-carbon energy. As a top CO2-emitting country, hydrogen (especially green hydrogen) production in South Africa has gained momentum due to the availability of resources, such as solar energy, land, wind energy, platinum group metals (as catalysts for electrolysers), and water. However, the demand for green hydrogen in South Africa is insignificant, which implies that the majority of the production must be exported. Despite the positive developments, there are unclear matters, such as dependence on the national electricity grid for green hydrogen production and the cost of transporting it to Asian and European markets. Hence, this study aims to explore opportunities for economic expansion for sustainable production, transportation, storage, and utilisation of green hydrogen produced in South Africa. This paper uses a thematic literature review methodology. The key findings are that the available renewable energy sources, incentivizing the green economy, carbon taxation, and increasing the demand for green hydrogen in South Africa and Africa could decrease the cost of hydrogen from 3.54 to 1.40 €/kgH2 and thus stimulate its production, usage, and export. The appeal of green hydrogen lies in diversifying products to green hydrogen as an energy carrier, clean electricity, synthetic fuels, green ammonia and methanol, green fertilizers, and green steel production with the principal purpose of significant energy decarbonisation and economic and foreign earnings. These findings are expected to drive the African hydrogen revolution in agreement with the AU 2063 agenda. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Conceptualising the demand for ecosystem services – an adapted spatial-structural approach,"People require multiple ecosystem services (ES) to meet their basic needs and improve or maintain their quality of life. In order to meet these needs, natural resources are exploited, threatening biodiversity and increasing the pressure on the Earth's ecosystems. Spatial-structural approaches are used to explain and visualise the spatial relationships and connections between areas that provide and benefit from ES. However, areas where the demand for these ES occurs are rarely considered in existing spatial approaches or equated with areas where people can use the benefits. In order to highlight the differences between these two areas, we would like to introduce the 'Service Demanding Area' (SDA) in an adapted spatial-structural approach. This approach relates SDA to already familiar ES provision and use units, namely Service Providing Areas (SPA), Service Connecting Areas (SCA) and Service Benefitting Areas (SBA) and can be used to schematically illustrate, understand and analyse the different forms of demand that can emerge. A literature review was conducted to provide an overview of the spatial mapping of ES demand. Three issues arose that should be addressed to improve the assessment of ES demand: 1) The term ES demand is not used consistently. To avoid confusion, it is important to clarify how ES demand is understood and how it differs from the other components of the ES concept (e.g. ES supply, ES potential, ES flow); 2) It is important to consider that ES demand is multi-faceted and is generated on different geographical scales, including the full range of stakeholders' perceptions, needs and desires which broadens the picture of societal demand for ES; 3) Meaningful interpretations between ES supply and demand need to be available to inform decision-makers about interventions for reducing ES trade-offs and mismatches. © Dworczyk C, Burkhard B.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability as the Development Paradigm: Evolving Frames and Interpretations,"The concept of sustainability has evolved over time to encompass a broader range of issues and perspectives, and this evolution continues as new challenges and opportunities arise. There are several gaps and challenges in mainstreaming Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into India’s development policies, plans, and programs. These challenges encompass various aspects, including lack of scientific data, policy implementation, enabling institutions and governance, and funding. Insufficient data on critical variables like biodiversity loss, climate change impacts, and sustainable consumption hampers progress. There is a deficiency in policies and regulations aimed at promoting holistic and sustainable growth. This is partly due to a lack of political will to enact enabling framework and a lack of coordination across different government sectors. This can be attributed to a lack of capacity and resources for sustainable projects, as well as limited engagement from corporate sectors and civil societies. Insufficient monitoring and evaluation methods, lack of coordination, and limited involvement of key stakeholders may further hinder desired progress. A major obstacle is the absence of adequate funding and resources for large-scale sustainable development projects. This can be due to a lack of financial instruments, insufficient investment in sustainable infrastructure and technologies, or both. Achieving some SDGs may require greater amount of international cooperation and partnerships, which can be challenging due to complex geopolitical environment. Despite these challenges, India has made significant progress towards achieving the SDGs in many sectors, particularly renewable energy, education, and housing. To continue this progress, it is crucial to address issues of inequality and promote inclusive development. Collaboration between the government, private sector, civil society, and individuals is essential to mobilize resources, build capacity, and create an enabling environment for meeting SDG targets. Success in reaching these goals is contingent on collective actions that promote a harmonious relationship with nature. A multidisciplinary and holistic approach, encompassing scientific, economic, and social perspectives, is necessary to bridge these critical gaps and drive sustainable development forward. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
A paper on balancing CSO program investment: The King County Green infrastructure scorecard,"King County Wastewater Treatment Division (WTD) is in the process of considering Green Infrastructure (GI) projects as part of their Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) program capital planning, as part of that effort, WTD is working to determine when the investment in GI is commensurate to the cost of gray infrastructure on a unit basis (i.e., cost per gallon of CSO reduction). Additionally, WTD is working to identify what level of additional investment is appropriate for GI as compared to gray infrastructure based on the value of the ancillary benefits of GI, such as reducing stormwater flow to sewer system, providing ecosystem services, urban greening, climate change resiliency, etc. The development of a GI Project Scorecard (Scorecard) intends to provide WTD with the data to identify the types of GI projects, locations, and/or minimum performance necessary to be hydraulically cost-competitive to gray alternatives. This work also intends to provide King County WTD decision-makers with better information on when to pursue a capital GI project, how to select between multiple project concepts, and how to report out the justification for pursing a specific GI project. The Scorecard was developed through the research and review of existing GI cost and performance data, analysis of the co-benefits of GI and related value specific to King County, the development of cost-performance thresholds for GI, and the documentation of the Scorecard's project evaluation metrics and methods. This presentation will inform conference participants on how those metrics were selected and the methods for quantifying those project benefits that are often considered unquantifiable.

Practical aspects of smart gardening system based on priority driven scheduling to utilize resources at optimum level,"Agriculture in India plays an important role in GDP (Gross Domestic Prod-uct) too. We have proposed a novel system based on the priority-driven approach to irrigating the plants. Our focus is on utilizing the resources, especially water in the agriculture sector at an optimum level. Providing good quality water to the crops is also one of the modules of the proposed system. The advantage of the proposed system is to immediately provide water to the plant where moisture level is decreased. Smart gardening is proposed as most demanded sustainable technology. In the agriculture sector, in future due to the irregularity of monsoon water scarcity will increase. Though sufficient water is available, still we have to preserve it for the future because day to day monsoon is irregular and ground-water is decreasing. We have used sensors and devices to sense the temperature, humidity, moisture, pH of the water and soil. Providing water to the plant where moisture level is very less, calculating pH of the water and soil are the important aspects of our proposed system. If the farmer is using pesticides which is harmful to the soil and which is affecting the pH of the soil, it will be immediately noticed by the system. © 2018, ICIC International.

"Farmers’ perceptions of major challenges to smallholder dairy farming in selected towns of Jimma Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia: possible influences, impacts, coping strategies and support required","Peri urban and urban small-scale dairy farming is playing a vital role in improving household income, nutrition, food security and employment for low income households in Ethiopia. However, it has been unable to meet the expected demand due to various production constraints. Thus, this study aimed to assess the farmers’ perception of major challenges of smallholder dairy production, possible causes, coping strategies and support needed in selected towns of Jimma Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 52 randomly selected dairy farmers using a semi-structured questionnaire. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to assess responses to questions in the survey. The results revealed that the main reason for dairy farming was milk production primarily for household consumption. Majority of respondents acquired their crossbred cows through purchases. The effect of demographic characteristics of respondents on herd size and milk yield showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). However, there was a tendency for male respondents with university education and retired to own larger herd size (9.33 ± 1.33 and 8.00 ± 4.00) and higher milk yield (8.67 ± 2.67 and 4.50 ± 3.50 L) per cow per day. Feed scarcity (weighted mean index value = 0.371), lack of land (x̄ = 0.311), diseases (x̄ = 0.077), lack of improved genotypes (x̄ = 0.061), lack of credit (x̄ = 0.058), low productivity (x̄ = 0.036), lack of or inefficient artificial insemination (x̄ = 0.034), low milk prices (x̄ = 0.025), labour shortages (x̄ = 0.023), and water scarcity (x̄ = 0.004) were perceived as the major challenges of dairy farming. Based on the findings of the study, it was concluded that proper planning and implementation of appropriate institutional, technical, and technological interventions in an integrated approach with multiple stakeholders and dairy farmers would be essential to overcome the identified constraints of dairy production and to improve food security of dairy farmers in the study area. © 2022 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Managing rivers for fisheries and livelihoods: How can we do it better?,"The growing attention being given to improving water productivity at the catchment level has given rise to increased interest in the contribution of aquatic ecosystems and in particular fisheries to reducing rural poverty and improving food security. There is growing recognition that these natural resources have an important role to play in pro-poor water management in many of the world's river basins, but that capacity to optimize these benefits is constrained by a lack of appropriate technologies and tools to do so. The present paper provides an overview of the current state of understanding of these issues and identifies a number of challenges to be addressed, namely the need to: (i) build wider understanding of the value of river fisheries; (ii) understand the water requirements for sustaining river fisheries; and (iii) develop governance arrangements that bring fisheries to the decision-making table. It concludes by distilling from recent reviews of river fisheries valuation, environmental flows, and governance, a set of specific directions that need to be taken in order to meet these challenges. © IWA Publishing 2005.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable development.,"Many attempts have been made over the last decade to define sustainable development (SD). However, it is much easier to describe one's expectations of SD.

Who cares for the environment? Pro-environmental and political opinions in relation to basic psychological needs. A person-centered approach,"Effective educational activities aimed at shaping pro-environmental behavior require knowledge of the characteristics of the group to which they are to be addressed and should therefore be preceded by a diagnosis of their needs. Apart from the characteristics of the individuals, the geo-political context in which we function also plays a role in human–environmental interactions. Therefore, to better understand their role, we conducted a study aimed at examining whether three basic psychological needs and political views were related to pro-environmental opinions in a unique geopolitical situation that took place in Poland in December 2021. A representative sample of 1241 adult Polish respondents, 52.7% of whom were female, took part in an anonymous quantitative survey, based on a survey questionnaire and conducted in a research panel. We found weak correlations between the basic psychological needs satisfaction and pro-environmental opinions, as well as a moderate positive correlation between left-wing political views and pro-environmental opinions. Moreover, a cluster analysis revealed a cluster of “needs satisfaction” and “needs frustration,” and these two clusters differed, given the higher pro-environmental opinions and left-wing political views in the “needs satisfaction” group. We discuss the results in the light of the basic psychological needs theory and implications for educational and sustainable development promotion practice. The beneficiaries of this study may include not only psychologists interested in the issues of human–environment relations in the context of basic needs but also people involved in the creation and implementation of educational pro-environmental policies or adult educators. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Balancing carrots and sticks in REDD+: Implications for social safeguards,"Reducing carbon emissions through avoided deforestation and forest degradation and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) is key to mitigating global climate change. The aim of REDD+ social safeguards is to ensure that REDD+ does not harm, and actually benefits, local people. To be eligible for results-based compensation through REDD+, countries should develop national-level safeguard information systems to monitor and report on the impacts of REDD+. Although safeguards represent a key step for promoting social responsibility in REDD+, they are challenging to operationalize and monitor. We analyzed the impacts of different types of REDD+ interventions (incentives vs. disincentives) on key safeguard-relevant indicators, i.e., tenure security, participation, and subjective well-being, as well as on reported forest clearing. We used household-level data collected in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Vietnam from approximately 4000 households in 130 villages at two points in time (2010-2012 and 2013-2014). Our findings highlight a decrease in perceived tenure security and overall perceived well-being over time for households exposed to disincentives alone, with the addition of incentives helping to alleviate negative effects on well-being. In Brazil, although disincentives were associated with reduced reported forest clearing by smallholders, they were the intervention that most negatively affected perceived well-being, highlighting a clear trade-off between carbon and noncarbon benefits. Globally, although households exposed to REDD+ interventions were generally aware of local REDD+ initiatives, meaningful participation in initiative design and implementation lagged behind. Our analysis contributes to a relatively small literature that seeks to operationalize REDD+ social safeguards empirically and to evaluate the impacts of REDD+ interventions on local people and forests. © 2017 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Environment: Does China care about it?,"For centuries, the environment in China has been under enormous pressure due to the growing population, which has almost tripled in the course of the 20th century alone. Today, China is approaching its population peak of 1.46 billion inhabitants, which, among other things, represents a significant burden on natural resources. Moreover, at the end of the 1970s, a period of unprecedented rapid economic growth started in China, coupled with increased demand for energy supply and natural resources. The process of opening up to the world did not only bring an economic miracle but also catalyzed social and environmental problems. Air pollution, water scarcity, soil contamination, and many other environmental problems gradually became so evident that they could no longer be overlooked. The Communist Party of China (CCP) had to intervene - it was forced by the pressure of its own population and by growing pressure at the international level. Today, the Chinese leadership has to cope with an environmental crisis that is not easy to resolve. On the one hand, there is a vision of a greener future, but on the other, the risk of substantial economic losses exists. Adopting drastic environmental measures could jeopardize the stability of China’s industrial regions, cause unemployment, and raise a number of other problems. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Kristina Kironska and Richard Q.

"An overview of agriculture, nutrition and fortification, supplementation and biofortification: Golden Rice as an example for enhancing micronutrient intake","The worlds growing population and limited land resources require high intensity of food production. Human nutrition needs both macronutrients and micronutrients. One way of providing micronutrients in staple crops of the poor is biofortification, through plant breeding. All methods of plant breeding are acceptable and safe, and some methods can deliver micronutrients not achievable by other methods. Vitamin A deficiency is responsible for around 4500 preventable child deaths daily, and Golden Rice, biofortified with provitamin A, has proven potential as a costless intervention where rice is the staple crop. The Cartagena Protocol's concentration on a very narrow concern for environment is changing to embrace concern for sustainable development, food security and climate change. The World Bank is recommending the use of biofortified cereals, including Golden Rice as an example, as the norm rather than the exception in addressing malnutrition, noting that education, social marketing and mass media are important to optimise the effectiveness of any food-based approaches to malnutrition alleviation. Regulatory applications have been made for Golden Rice, transformation event GR2E, relating to the safety of human food and feed, which has been confirmed by one regulatory authority at the time of printing.

Sustainable Development in Agriculture: Soil Management,"Developing sustainable techniques for agriculture and soil management is essential for ensuring food security, protecting natural resources, and promoting sustainable livelihoods and exploring the importance of research and exploration in this field, highlighting key research questions related to soil health, water management, agricultural technologies, policy interventions, and the impacts of climate change. It emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate social, economic, and environmental considerations to promote sustainable techniques for agriculture and soil management. This involves investigating the impacts of different agricultural practices on the environment and human health and exploring innovative approaches to improving agricultural productivity while minimizing negative effects on natural resources. This will involve exploring the potential for small-scale and diversified farming systems like India to support sustainable livelihoods or assessing the effectiveness of different policy interventions by the government. It will involve field research to understand the soil quality, climate, and other factors that affect crop production and explore the potential for new approaches to farming, such as agro forestry, to improve soil health, reduce erosion, and enhance biodiversity. Based on the field research and data, an analysis will be carried out and a machine learning model will predict the crops, and manures to be added to improve soil fertility without harming the natural resources climatic conditions, and their impact during every phase. Our research may also be used to develop a country-while centralized system that will help the farmers and the government to grow the demanded crops and this will also reduce the wastage of grains in cases of overproduction. It will also uplift the farmers by providing them with an adequate sum of money for their products since they will be growing the demanded crops only. Overall, sustainable techniques for agriculture and soil management are essential for ensuring that agricultural production can meet the needs of a growing global population while protecting natural resources and supporting sustainable livelihoods. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",Not About Sufficiency
Steering the restoration of degraded agroecosystems during the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration,"Agroecosystems are the largest human-natural coupled production system covering ~40% of the planet earth and provide essential ecosystem services for a good quality of life and human wellbeing. The sustainable management of agroecosystems are therefore essential for meeting the food, fuel, fiber, and fodder demands of the rapidly growing human population. Agroecosystems also play a key role in trace gases emission, and also affect the quality and usage of life-supporting resources such as air, water, soil etc. Though the sustainable management of agroecosystems are imperative for achieving UN-Sustainable Development Goals, they are frequently under degradation due to multiple drivers of changes such as unsustainable land-use practices, biodiversity loss, pollution and climate change, etc. Therefore, cordial efforts at national, regional and global levels are essential for managing agroecosystems to meet out the global goals and also the targets of the United Nations- Decade o-n Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030). Here we opined various strategies for restoring degraded agroecosystems for sustainable development including the adoption of emerging paradigms such as micro-agriculture, urban agriculture, and landless agriculture for averting the mounting pressure on agroecosystems for the benefit of both people and the planet. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency
"Spatiotemporal Change Analysis and Multi-Scenario Modeling of Ecosystem Service Values: A Case Study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration, China","Ecosystem service value (ESV) assessment is a crucial indicator of regional ecological quality and ecological management effectiveness. Ecosystem services (ES) provide the environmental foundation for human existence and social advancement. However, the future course of land use change (LUC) in urban agglomerations and its implications for human society remains uncertain, which presents a challenge to maintaining a balance between ecological service functions and regional socioeconomic growth. This paper took the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration as an example and used the future land use simulation (FLUS) model to project the spatial distribution of land use under the natural development scenario (NDS), food security scenario (FSS), and ecological priority scenario (EPS) of BTH in 2030, 2040, and 2050. Next, the changes to ESV under various scenarios were investigated through the equivalent coefficient method. In order to make more targeted recommendations for regional development, the study also used hotspot analyses to explore the impacts of LUCs on ESV. The results showed that: (1) from 2000 to 2020, the LUC in the BTH was dramatic and mainly focused on the interconversions among the three land use categories of cropland, grassland, and built-up land. The total ESV demonstrated the tendency to decrease from CNY 386,859.89 × 106 in 2000 to CNY 371,968.78 × 106 in 2020. (2) Compared with 2020, the ESV in BTH in 2050 under the FSS loses 16,568.78 × 106 CNY, followed by the NDS (CNY 10,960.84 × 106), while the ESV under the EPS increases by CNY 9373.74 × 106. The results of the scenario simulation showed that there was significant variability in ESV under different political orientations. (3) Hotspot analysis indicated that the ESV changes were clustered in the northeastern part and the eastern coastal region of the BTH. On this basis, we identified Chengde, Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou as the key cities to focus on and made meaningful suggestions for their future regional environmental protection and sustainable development. This research can serve as a guide in creating sustainable BTH development policies and offer fresh perspectives for investigating how land use patterns affect the ecological environment’s regional quality under various policy trajectories. © 2024 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Unraveling the complex interactions between ozone pollution and agricultural productivity in China's main winter wheat region using an interpretable machine learning framework,"Surface ozone has become a significant atmospheric pollutant in China, exerting a profound impact on crop production and posing a serious threat to food security. Previous studies have extensively explored the physiological mechanisms of ozone damage to plants. However, the effects of ozone interactions with other environmental factors, such as climate change, on agricultural productivity at the regional scale, particularly under natural conditions, remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we employed an interpretable machine learning framework, specifically the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm enhanced by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to investigate the influence of ozone and its interactions with environmental factors on crop production in China's primary winter wheat region. Additionally, a structural equation model was developed to elucidate the mechanisms driving these interactions. Our findings demonstrate that ozone pollution exerts a significant negative effect on winter wheat productivity (r = −0.47, P < 0.001), with productivity losses escalating from −12.28 % to −22.09 % as ozone levels increase. Notably, the impact of ozone is spatially heterogeneous, with western Shandong province identified as a hotspot for ozone-induced damage. Furthermore, our results confirm the complexity of the relationship between ozone pollution and agricultural productivity, which is influenced by multiple interacting environmental factors. Specifically, we found that severe ozone pollution, when combined with high aerosol concentrations or elevated temperatures, significantly exacerbates crop productivity losses, although drought conditions can partially mitigate these adverse effects. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating the interactive effects of air pollution and climate change into future crop models. The comprehensive framework developed in this study, which integrates statistical modeling with explainable machine learning, provides a valuable methodological reference for quantitatively assessing the impact of air pollution on crop productivity at a regional scale. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Interaction among Air Pollution, National Health, and Economic Development","This paper constructs a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and vector error correction (VECM) model, analyzes the air pollution, economic development, and national health of China from 1990 to 2019, and evaluates the economic losses from the respiratory diseases caused by air pollution. The results show that: (1) China’s economy continues to grow, and the corresponding amount of exhaust gas emissions (during the study period) showed a trend of first increasing and then slowly decreasing. (2) The overall burden of respiratory diseases in China showed a downward trend, with significant differences in gender and age. (3) A significant long-term equilibrium relationship existed between per capita gross domestic product (PGDP), exhaust emissions, and the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of the respiratory disease burden. Exhaust emissions will bring about short-term fluctuations of PGDP and disease burden DALYs. Air pollution is mainly caused by exhaust gas emissions, and DALYs and PGDP have little effect on air pollution. (4) Indirect economic losses from respiratory diseases caused by air pollution are likely to be long-term and will impose increasing pressure. On the basis of the healthy and sustainable operation of the economic system, the government should effectively prevent environmental health risks and improve the pollution treatment level. © 2022 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping the global distribution of locally-generated marine ecosystem services: The case of the West and Central Pacific Ocean tuna fisheries,"Ecosystem service (ES) maps are instrumental for the assessment and communication of the costs and benefits of human-nature interactions. Yet, despite the increased understanding that we live a globalized tele-coupled world where such interactions extend globally, ES maps are usually place-based and fail to depict the global flows of locally produced ES. We aim to shift the way ES maps are developed by bringing global value chains into ES assessments. We propose and apply a conceptual framework that integrates ES provision principles, with value chain analysis and human well-being assessment methods, while considering the spatial dimension of these components in ES mapping. We apply this framework to the case of seafood provision from purse seine tuna fishery in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. The ES maps produced demonstrate the flow of a marine ES to a series of global beneficiaries via different trade and mobility pathways. We identify three types of flows – one to one, closed loop and open loop. We emphasize the need to consider a series of intermediate beneficiaries in ES mapping despite the lack of data. We highlight the need for a shift in ES mapping, to better include global commodity flows, across spatial scales. © 2018 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

"Going global, locally? Decentralized environmental expenditure and air quality","Achieving more liveable cities is one of the main goals set by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to a recent survey, most subnational governments participate in SDG implementation, especially to achieve environmental goals. Moreover, the public health concerns of COVID‑19 have helped to motivate even more cities to improve local air quality. However, despite the importance of intergovernmental cooperation for the success of the SDGs, there is still limited progress at the regional and local levels, due to limited institutional capacity and doubts about electoral consequences of unevenly distributed costs. We use panel data for 2010-2019, covering 217 OECD metropolitan areas, together with consolidated environmental expenditure, and find that subnational public spending on environmental protection is more strongly associated with better municipal air quality than environmental expenditure by general governments. Moreover, environmental spending shows a relationship with reduced air pollution exposure through the mechanism of higher institutional quality. © This is an Open Access article distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License which permits non commercial use and redistribution, as long as you give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.",Not About Sufficiency
"Land Use Conflict Identification Coupled with Ecological Protection Priority in Jinan City, China","Land use conflicts exacerbate soil erosion and reduce biodiversity, which is detrimental to sustainable development. Multiple methods such as multi-criteria evaluation and landscape pattern indexes can identify land use conflicts, but few studies conform to the concept of green development. The concept of green development gives priority to ecological protection and coordinates the relationship between production development, food production and ecological protection to achieve sustainable development. Taking Jinan City (China) as the study area, we identified the ecological source areas by evaluating the importance of ecosystem service functions and ecological sensitivity, then extracted and optimized the ecological corridor network (using the minimum cumulative resistance model and gravity model), and constructed the ecological security pattern. Spatial overlay analysis of cultivated land, construction land, and the ecological security pattern was performed to identify the types and intensity of land use conflicts. Spatially, we found that ecological land was in more serious conflict with cultivated land than construction land. Different types of land use conflicts have significant differences in spatial distribution. The key to land use conflict mediation in Jinan City is to balance food security with the improvements in the quality of the ecological environment. Hence, it is necessary to delineate the main functional zones and formulate tailored land use conflict mediation strategies in each zone. The method for land use conflict identification proposed here follows the principle of giving priority to ecological protection, providing a scientific reference for the utilization and protection of territorial space in other similar areas. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Intensive land-use is associated with development status in port cities of Southeast Asia,"Port cities in Southeast Asia (SEA) have been undergoing intensive land use and land cover change (LUCC) because of rapid socio-economic development in recent decades. However, various development statuses among these cities could result in divergent LUCC transitions and therefore affect the local ecosystem at different levels. This study investigated the historic land-use transition in the SEA port cities by classifying Landsat images from 1990 to 2020 with the random forest algorithm, and further integrated these patterns with land-use modeling to inform the future land uses under the current developing mode. DIVISON was used to assess land-use fragmentation and investigated its relationship with development levels represented by the average nighttime light index (ANLI). The results showed an intensive LUCC in SEA port cities in 1990-2020, with artificial surface increasing by 9.2% (175.9 km2) of the total area, mainly converted from cultivated land which decreased by 136.9 km2. An inverted V-shaped relationship between fragmentation and development level was found at the landscape level and for cultivated land, in which both turning points (TPs) occurred in the mid-developed stage (ANLI = 41.1 and 20.0, respectively). Artificial surfaces tended to be more aggregated in later developed stages, showing a TP of ANLI around 53.2. Under the current developing mode, the aggregation trend will be generally continued for the next three decades, mainly resulting from the increased connection in artificial surfaces. The findings also highlighted a tradeoff between city development and agricultural production in SEA port cities, leading to increased food insecurity in more developed stages. Recent developments also negatively affected aqua ecosystems, such as aquaculture, mangroves, and natural waterbodies in several cities. This study underscored the importance of the sustainable LUCC strategy in SEA port cities and provides insights into rationalizing land-use policies for other port cities worldwide. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Land Use/Cover Change and Its Policy Implications in Typical Agriculture-forest Ecotone of Central Jilin Province, China","During the 21st century, policies toward agriculture, forestry, and urbanization have emerged to ensure food security, ecological restoration, and human well-being by managing land in Northeast China. However, the integrated effects and relationships of various policies are still not well understood. This study observed the land use land cover changes in Central Jilin from 2000 to 2019 and, by considering policy involvement, aimed to understand the effects and trade-offs of policies. Results showed that the cropland, including dryland and rice paddy, and the forest, including coniferous forest and deciduous forest, are dominant land types in Central Jilin. During 2000–2019, the land changed diversely, of which the main changes were the expanded dryland (+0.43 million ha), the increased deciduous forest (+22 million ha), the decreased coniferous forest (−0.08 million ha), and the expanded urban settlement (+0.04 million ha). With these changes, despite the unit grain yield showing a rising trend, the yield contribution of Central Jilin to the national total decreased. The poor cultivating structure made for the cropland expansion and reduced the implementation space of environmental restoration projects such as the Grain to Green. Thus, in Central Jilin that transits from the agri-food production zone to the eco-regulation zone, environmental projects coexisted in a trade-off manner with agricultural policies that aim to liberate agricultural productivity. In the key urban agglomerations of Central Jilin, the increase in the proportion of green space improved the thermal environment and carbon balance. The gross domestic product of the large city and its local proportion also rose. These improvements benefited from the promotion of development policies and urbanization policies at key time points. In the future, it is necessary to coordinate agricultural policies and environmental projects and promote the progress of small- and medium-sized cities to ensure the equality of regional development. This study has implications for making decisions to revitalize Northeast China and researchers who inform decisions. © 2021, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
Northward expansion of paddy rice in northeastern Asia during 2000-2014,"Paddy rice in monsoon Asia plays an important role in global food security and climate change. Here we documented annual dynamics of paddy rice areas in the northern frontier of Asia, including northeastern (NE) China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan, from 2000 to 2014 through analysis of satellite images. The paddy rice area has increased by 120% (2.5 to 5.5 million ha) in NE China, in comparison to a decrease in South Korea and Japan, and the paddy rice centroid shifted northward from 41.16°N to 43.70°N (~310 km) in this period. Market, technology, policy, and climate together drove the rice expansion in NE China. The increased use of greenhouse nurseries, improved rice cultivars, agricultural subsidy policy, and a rising rice price generally promoted northward paddy rice expansion. The potential effects of large rice expansion on climate change and ecosystem services should be paid more attention to in the future. ©2016. American Geophysical Union.

Exploring the potential of decentralized extension models on the sustainability of livelihoods: a food security lens on aquaculture farmers in Bangladesh,"Small-scale farmers in Bangladesh aquaculture face multiple challenges. Among these challenges are the inadequate supply of quality seed, limited credit access, poor availability of quality fish feed, land-use conflicts, the adverse effects of climate change, and the low adoption of best aquaculture management practices. These challenges spiral into low productivity, low incomes, and low food security of households. Extension has been seen as an important tool for technology and knowledge transfer, resulting in increased farm productivity and household food security. However, small-scale aquaculture farmers in Bangladesh lack access to critical extension service needed to improve productivity and their livelihoods. Using Propensity Score Matching, we test whether more decentralized extension systems yield similar food security outcomes as traditional extension models. Analysing data from 1,017 respondent, we find that decentralized extension models lead to improved food security of aquaculture households compared to non-beneficiaries. We recommend among others, the critical need to synergize extension systems, reduce costs and better target aquaculture farmers. Additionally, public-private partnerships can help leverage strengths from various extension approaches for more effective knowledge dissemination to aquaculture farmers, ultimately enhancing their livelihoods.

Perfectly imperfect and muddling through for sustainable futures,"Purpose: To combat climate change, protect biodiversity, maintain water quality, facilitate a just transition for workers and engage citizens and communities, a diversity of stakeholders across multiple levels work together and collaborate to co-create mutually beneficial solutions. This paper aims to illustrate how a 7.5-year collaboration between local communities, researchers, academics, companies, state agencies and policymakers is contributing to the reframing of industrial harvested peatlands to regenerative ecosystems and carbon sinks with impacts on ecological, economic, social and cultural systems. Design/methodology/approach: The European Union LIFE Integrated Project, Peatlands and People, responding to Ireland’s Climate Action Plan, represents Europe’s largest rehabilitation of industrially harvested peatlands. It makes extensive use of marketing research for reframing strategies and actions by partners, collaborators and communities in the evolving context of a just transition to a carbon-neutral future. Findings: The results highlight the ecological, economic, social and cultural reframing of peatlands from fossil fuel and waste lands to regenerative ecosystems bursting with biodiversity and climate solution opportunities. Reframing impacts requires muddling through the ebbs and flows of planned, possible and unanticipated change that can deliver benefits for peatlands and people over time. Research limitations/implications: At 3 of 7.5 years into a project, the authors are muddling through how ecological reframing impacts economic and social/cultural reframing. Further impacts, planned and unplanned, can be expected. Practical implications: This paper shows how an impact planning canvas tool and impact taxonomy can be applied for social and systems change. The tools can be used throughout a project to understand, respond to and manage for unplanned events. There is constant learning, constantly going back to the impact planning canvas and checking where we are, what is needed. There is action and reaction to each other and to the diversity of stakeholders affected and being affected by the reframing work. Originality/value: This paper considers how systemic change through ecological, economic, social and cultural reframing is a perfectly imperfect process of muddling through which holds the promise of environmental, economic, technological, political, social and educational impacts to benefit nature, individuals, communities, organisations and society. © 2023, Christine T.

Sustainability assessment of renewable power and heat generation technologies,"Rationalisation of consumption, more efficient energy usage and a new energy structure are needed to be achieved in order to shift the structure of energy system towards sustainability. The required energy system is among others characterised by intensive utilisation of renewable energy sources (RES). RES technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, for the strategic planning there is a great demand for the comparison of RES technologies. Furthermore, there are additional functions of RES utilisation expected beyond climate change mitigation, e.g. increment of employment, economic growth and rural development. The aim of the study was to reveal the most beneficial RES technologies with special respect to sustainability. Ten technologies of power generation and seven technologies of heat supply were examined in a multi-criteria sustainability assessment frame of seven attributes which were evaluated based on a choice experiment (CE) survey. According to experts the most important characteristics of RES utilisation technologies are land demand and social impacts i.e. increase in employment and local income generation. Concentrated solar power (CSP), hydropower and geothermal power plants are favourable technologies for power generation, while geothermal district heating, pellet-based non-grid heating and solar thermal heating can offer significant advantages in case of heat supply. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Capture techniques' use of caranguejo-uçá crabs (Ucides cordatus) in Paraíba state (northeastern Brazil) and its socio-environmental implications,"The present study was undertaken in two traditional communities that are located on the margins of the estuary and mangrove complex of the Mamanguape River, Paraíba state (PB), Brazil. This work describes the crabs capture techniques tapamento and redinha, and identifies the negative socio-environmental impacts of redinha, using qualitative methods (open and semi-structured interviews, guided tours, direct observation and the administration of questionnaires). Results indicate that currently only two principle techniques are used to capture Ucides cordatus: redinha and tapamento. Tapamento has a low impact in relation to redinha. Redinha was pointed out by interviewees as a system that has social impact (social conflicts, breaking of traditions, substitution and extinction of techniques) and environmental impact (less selective captures and high productivity, mangrove pollution, death of crabs caught in traps, cutting of the roots of Rhizophora mangle, micro-habitat loss resulting from galleries destroyed and polluted). Knowledge of crab harvesting carried out using these two techniques and the possible social and environmental impacts caused by redinha, can lead to more effective planning and actions towards the conservation of the species.",Not About Sufficiency

Mainstreaming marine biodiversity into the SDGs: The role of other effective area-based conservation measures (SDG 14.5),"This article explores the concept of “other effective area-based conservation measures” (OECMs) in the context of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 on marine protected areas and OECMs and its linkages to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It argues that mainstreaming biodiversity through CBD Aichi Biodiversity Targets’ implementation into the SDGs can contribute to a more systemic and comprehensive implementation of SDG 14.5 on conservation of at least 10% of marine and coastal areas. It argues that OECMs can complement MPAs and contribute to ecologically representative and effectively managed marine protected areas systems integrated into broader governance systems such as marine spatial planning. Selected global and local sectoral conservation measures are therefore highlighted in this analysis as potential forms of OECMs. At the local level, a case study of ecologically or biologically significant marine areas managed as locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) in Mozambique is discussed. This case study explores how multiple-use LMMAs, which respond to short-term fisher's needs and targeted biodiversity conservation, could contribute to the achievement of specific SDGs on food security, poverty elimination and resilient ecosystems if properly supported by long-term investments, strong institutions and integrated oceans management. © 2017 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Indigenous management of wetlands: Experiences in Ethiopia,"This title was first published in 2003. There has been increasing recognition around the world that wetlands are fragile ecosystems which require sensitive and sustainable management if they are to continue to provide their range of functions and benefits. These functions and benefits, which include contributions to food security and environmental regulation, play a critical role in sustaining rural livelihoods in many developing countries. Drawing upon research carried out in the area, this book identifies and discusses the importance of wetlands to local communities in south-west Ethiopia, and in particular, how indigenous wetland management practices contribute to sustainable wetland use. As the basis of wetland management, particular attention is paid to the role of Indigenous Knowledge Systems, and how knowledge of wetland functioning is acquired, disseminated, developed and applied by local communities in their wetland management strategies. Critically, this community knowledge is examined in the context of scientific data, specifically that obtained from a wetland hydrology monitoring programme, thereby drawing attention to the strengths and weaknesses of both systems. This has major implications not only for the ways in which wetlands and other natural resources are managed at the local level, but also for the wider rural development strategies of governments and non-governmental organizations. © Alan B.

"Sustaino-resilient agroforestry for climate resilience, food security and land degradation neutrality","""Anthropocene epoch"" is an unofficial unit of geological time which resulted due to insignificant effects of human activities on the climate and ecosystems. The term alone is not enough and it is most important to develop or manage Sustaino-resilient Agroforestry (SRAF) models locally or globally. Some researchers are keeping sustainability science and resilience theory separate and focusing on further exploring their distinctiveness while others are using them in combination. Most of the common agroforestry (AF) practices are either sustainable or resilient and normally facing some challenges related to species selection and composition, labor, natural resource conservation, productivity, erratic climate and ecological concern. These challenges can be effectively tackled by SRAF practices by using principles and practices of climate-smart farming, integrated farming, organic farming, native plant farming, natural farming, permaculture and precision farming. SRAF systems are helpful in diversifying livelihood, increasing food security, conservation and efficient utilization of natural resources, providing various ecosystem services as well as reducing pressure on forest. Most of the agricultural space can adopt AF because of the adoption and availability of fast-growing, economic and climate resilient trees along with the livestock that thrive well under limited space. These SRAF practices also contribute to various countries' commitment on land degradation neutrality (LDN) and United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) of climate action, zero hunger, no poverty, good health and well-being in addition to increasing food security by 2030. In summary, this chapter covers most of the AF aspects and is expected to be a guiding principle for practitioners to integrate SRAF practices and for policymakers to develop scientific and sustainable policies to achieve food security and ecological balance. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Opportunities and challenges for managers within the East-European agriculture sector: Case study on Romania,"Agriculture has always been essential to the development of human society, providing the food necessary for human survival. For the Romanian economy, agriculture is a very important sector in terms of the number of enterprises involved and the agricultural area used, but also because of the workforce employed in the sector. However, Romanian agriculture is a vulnerable sector, which has had to face several unfavourable events in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic, the energy crisis, the conflict in Ukraine, and the lack of agricultural inputs have brought many risks for Romanian farmers in 2023, such as higher food prices and more expensive electricity for consumers. This paper aims to identify the perceptions of the managers regarding the outcomes of the recent events (the COVID-19 pandemic, the energy crisis, the conflict in Ukraine) on the future potential of agriculture in Romania and to determine their perceptions about the impact of other issues with which agricultural companies had to deal with in recent years (climate change, draught, inflation, governmental measures). Other goals of the paper were to find out the managers’ plans and prospects to potentially introduce or use new technologies and digitization within their own companies and uncover their assessments regarding the sector’s future within the European and international context. To identify these perspectives, qualitative research was carried out through in-depth interviews with respondents holding leadership positions within 16 Romanian agricultural companies. The data was analyzed in order to identify similarities and discrepancies within their statements and find corroborative ideas that could help improve the sector. The results of the paper showed how the COVID-19 pandemic and the unstable geo-political context along with other issues increased production costs, but favored digitization and technology. In the past years, because different events changed the European and Romanian economy, a lot of academic research has revolved around the areas of health, energy and technology. Therefore, the study brings elements of originality because of the theme and the approach, which provide valuable insights not only for Romania but for other countries in the region as well. © 2024, Technical University of Liberec.

"Climate Change and Non-Communicable Diseases: A Bibliometric, Content, and Topic Modeling Analysis","This study examines research on the impact of climate change (CC) on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) using bibliometric analysis, topic modeling, and content analysis. Articles published in the Web of Science database between 2000 and 2024 were analyzed. VOSviewer and Biblioshiny were used for bibliometric analysis and Python for topic modeling. In addition, the 50 most cited articles were content analyzed. The results show that there has been an increasing number of publications over time and that the research originates predominantly from high/very high Human Development Index (HDI) countries, especially China and the United States, rather than from low HDI countries. These countries also have strong international cooperation networks. Topic modeling shows that high/very high HDI countries work on a balanced range of topics, while low HDI countries focus primarily on environmental impacts. Thematic analysis shows that research topics are evolving, diversifying, and deepening. As a result, the literature on CC-NCDs is expanding and deepening, thus providing evidence-based information for global public health interventions. However, in countries with low HDI and the most vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, the volume of publications, thematic diversity, and international cooperation are significantly low. Unfortunately, from a public health policy perspective, global climate change is far from being a problem that any country can solve alone. Global cooperation is, therefore, essential. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"Rangeland Degradation and Its Impacts Post-1992: Constructing the Perceptions of Boorana Pastoralist, Southern Ethiopia","The rangelands of Africa have been subject to substantial changes. The changes in the savanna rangelands ecology were often assessed from different points of view. This study constructs the perceptions of Boorana pastoralists on historic changes in rangelands post-1992 based on the Gadaa timelines. The construction of pastoralist perceptions can make an immense contribution to comprehending the rate, trends, indicators, and impacts of rangeland degradation in Boorana rangelands. This study thus points out that pastoralists can better understand and describe rangeland conditions and factors associated with such changes in the Gadaa periods. The study was based on the data collected from 332 pastoralists using a survey questionnaire and qualitative data, and the results were analyzed using descriptions of responses and narrations of cases. The study revealed that the conditions of the Boorana rangelands have been deteriorating over time and rangeland degradation showed unprecedented growth trends, mainly attributed to vegetation, rangeland production, human, environmental, and climate change-related factors. The study also shows that the progressive degradation of rangeland resources has jeopardized rangeland production, livestock productivity, and human well-being in the Boorana rangeland system. The study suggests that the recognition and promotion of indigenous ecological knowledge of pastoralists could sustain the pastoralist community in arid and semiarid rangelands. It is, therefore, imperative to understand pastoralists' knowledge of rangeland ecology for sustainable management of rangeland resources. © 2022 Galgalo Dika et al.",Not About Sufficiency

Climate justice now!: Imagining grassroots ecocosmopolitanism,"At the conclusion of the 16th Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change held at the seaside resort town of Cancún, Mexico, La Vía Campesina, one of the largest and most internationally diverse non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in attendance, declared: We must go beyond the anthropocentric model. We must rebuild the cosmovision of our peoples, based on a holistic view of the relationship between the cosmos, Mother Earth, the air, the water and all living beings. Human beings do not own nature, but rather form part of all that lives…. [We must] alert the social movements of the world about what is happening on the planet to defend life and Mother Earth, because we are defining the model for future generations…. We call on humanity to act immediately to rebuild the life of all of nature, applying the concept of “life in balance.” The small farmers, peasants, and indigenous agriculturalists from the four corners of the Earth hold in their hands thousands of solutions to climate change…. [We support] the people’s solutions to defend life and Mother Earth. (La Vía Campesina, italics added) (2010) Representing millions of small-and medium-scale farmers from 150 local organizations in 70 countries, La Vía Campesina (“the peasant’s/small farmer’s way of life”) challenged what they considered to be the conference’s unacceptable agenda for mitigating global warming and instead initiated a campaign calling for ""1,000 Cancún for Climate Justice.” Rejecting the mono-vision behind the “false and dangerous global solutions” to climate change like the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the Reduction of Emissions for Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiative, and geo-engineering, the organizers called for sustainable forms of agriculture and economic development to restore a “life in balance” and to protect future generations.1 Rather than investing in these false solutions, the members of La Vía Campesina exhorted the world’s leaders attending the conference to learn from the millions of peasant and small-scale farmers and indigenous communities throughout the world whose traditional lifeways and practices of sustainability in agriculture, forestry, and energy production have for years helped to “cool down the earth” (Conant, “Peasant Farming”). © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
"How climate, landscape, and economic changes increase the exposure of Echinococcus Spp.","Background: Echinococcosis is a global enzootic disease influenced by different biological and environmental factors and causes a heavy financial burden on sick families and governments. Currently, government subsidies for the treatment of patients with echinococcosis are only a fixed number despite patients’ finical income or cost of treatment, and health authorities are demanded to supply an annual summary of only endemic data. The risk to people in urban areas or non-endemic is increasing with climate, landscape, and lifestyle changes. Methods: We conducted retrospective descriptive research on inpatients with human echinococcosis (HE) in Lanzhou hospitals and analyzed the healthcare expenditure on inpatient treatment and examined the financial inequalities relating to different levels of gross domestic product. The livestock losses were also estimated by infection ratio. The occurrence records of Echinococcus spp. composed of hospitalized patients and dogs infected in the Gansu province were collected for Ecological niche modeling (ENM) to estimate the current suitable spatial distribution for the parasite in Gansu province. Then, we imported the resulting current niche model into future global Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios for estimation of future suitable habitat areas. Results: Between 2000 to 2020, 625 hospitalized HE patients (51% men and 49% women) were identified, and 48.32 ± 15.62 years old. The average cost of hospitalization expenses per case of HE in Gansu Province was ￥24,370.2 with an increasing trend during the study period and was negative with different counties’ corresponding gross domestic product (GDP). The trend of livestock losses was similar to the average cost of hospitalization expenses from 2015 to 2017. The three factors with the strongest correlation to echinococcosis infection probability were (1) global land cover (GLC, 56.6%), (2) annual precipitation (Bio12, 21.2%), and (3) mean temperature of the Wettest Quarter (Bio12, 8.5% of variations). We obtained a robust model that provides detail on the distribution of suitable areas for Echinococcus spp. including areas that have not been reported for the parasite. An increasing tendency was observed in the highly suitable areas of Echinococcus spp. indicating that environmental changes would affect the distributions. Conclusion: This study may help in the development of policies for at-risk populations in geographically defined areas and monitor improvements in HE control strategies by allowing targeted allocation of resources, including spatial analyses of expenditure and the identification of non-endemic areas or risk for these parasites, and a better comprehension of the role of the environment in clarifying the transmission dynamics of Echinococcus spp. Raising healthcare workers’ and travelers’ disease awareness and preventive health habits is an urgent agenda. Due to unpredictable future land cover types, prediction of the future with only climatic variables involved needs to be treated cautiously. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Participatory Stakeholder Assessment for Drivers of Mangrove Loss to Prioritize Evidence-Based Conservation and Restoration in Bhitarkanika and Mahanadi Delta, India","In recent times, environmental stewardship of mangroves has provided the impetus to protect and restore these ecosystems for their inherent ability to protect coastal regions from climate change, sequester carbon dioxide as rich blue carbon, and support human well-being through a multitude of ecosystem services. Participatory stakeholder assessment, as a part of the present study, integrated local stakeholder perspectives in assessing drivers of mangrove loss in Bhitarkanika and Mahanadi delta, Odisha, providing empirical evidence through a mixed-method approach. The use of a Likert scale provided the methodology to develop a single composite variable as the best measure of central tendency. In total, 27.5% of the respondents were locals and were living close to the study area for generations, whereas the other 72.5% represented researchers, academics, and forest department officials. Stakeholder responses at the ground level indicated that Bhitarkanika and Mahanadi delta were facing increased frequency of extreme climatic events followed, by aquaculture and other land-use changes, which can be considered potential drivers causing mangrove loss. Co-development of future scenarios by integrating concerns of all the stakeholders emerged as a potential solution to effectively address the trade-offs arising from local anthropogenic interferences, as well as large-scale developmental activities. This study highlights the need for convergence of multi-disciplinary knowledge from diverse stakeholder groups, including traditional and indigenous knowledge, for the purpose of developing accurate plausible alternative scenarios. Interactive governance and incentivization approaches, along with alternative livelihood opportunities, are proposed as the means to improve conservation and restoration in the region based on the present study. Understanding of the coupled socio-ecological system and its relevance is found to be critical to improve bi-directional linkages of ecosystem health and human well-being. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency

A study on the impact of the 2017 early monsoon flash flood: Potential measures to safeguard livelihoods from extreme climate events in the haor area of Bangladesh,"The northeastern part of Bangladesh is characterized by a unique wetland ecosystem called haor, which experiences regular monsoon flooding starting from late May/June. But change in rainfall pattern over last few decades has resulted in increased risk of early monsoon flash floods like the flood of 2017, which wreaked havoc in the haor at the beginning of April. Through a cross sectional survey covering 1845 flood affected households, the present study aims at understanding this flood's effects on their livelihoods and recommending policies to safeguard livelihoods in the face of changing climate. Analysis of rainfall and river water level data revealed that heavy rainfall in the haor and adjacent Indian sub-catchments were the main reasons behind this unprecedented event. Loss of income because of this flood was common, but was more prevalent among the older respondents, people having lower educational attainment and persons dependent on natural resources-based occupations. Most of the people who were forced to switch occupations experienced reduction in average daily income, irrespective of whatever occupations they switched to. Food insecurity was common among all groups, but was predominant among fishermen and day labourers. Integrated measures including development of real-time early warning system, community-based early response, proper management of crop protection embankments and regular dredging of waterways are essential to reduce the vulnerability of the people to flood. Furthermore, rapid expansion of newly developed short duration rice varieties (e.g. BRRI dhan 81), employment of case seedlings/raised-bed seedlings in elevated lands to ensure high quality timely transplantation immediately after recession of stagnant water, introduction of other profitable crops, poultry and dairy farming (e.g. sheep farming), creation of skill-based alternative livelihood options to adapt the agriculture sector with the changing climate. An equitable investment by the government is crucial to foster the economic growth by ending poverty by 2030, and to secure decent income, better livelihood and food security of the haor inhabitants. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
The Final Ecosystem Goods and Services (FEGS) Approach: A Beneficiary-Centric Method to Support Ecosystem-Based Management,"Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) and other social-ecological environmental management frameworks recognize that most environmental problems are ultimately social problems, requiring the reconciliation of human needs with the limits of ecosystem productivity and resilience. Using a social-ecological perspective in management practice can be greatly facilitated by identifying the attributes of ecosystems that are directly used, enjoyed, or appreciated by people connected to the environmental issue at hand. These are the final ecosystem goods and services (FEGS), which are specific to ecosystem types and how people use or appreciate ecological attributes of those ecosystems. This article: (1) reviews the conceptual basis of a FEGS approach for linking people’s well-being to ecosystems; (2) describes how FEGS are identified, organized, and measured using classification systems, and metrics and indicators; and (3) presents examples of how the FEGS approach can be integrated into EBM and other decision-making frameworks. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
"'Losing complexes': navigating technology, moral careers and mobility among disabled people in Kinshasa","In moral careers of personhood and subjectivity of people who are mobility impaired, technologies such as mobility aids can become intertwined with teleologies of personal progress. This article examines how technologies shaped and expressed personal growth and social identity among those who took part in transnational trade between Kinshasa and Brazzaville. Engaging with a particular socio-technical environment facilitates both personal movement and cross-border mobility, and therefore becomes central to the ways in which individuals present themselves as 'losing complexes' - that is, their perceived frustrations about their disability. Exchanging a stick for a crutch or a hand-cranked tricycle for a wheelchair facilitates different forms of movement and expresses how one seeks to navigate between embarrassment, pride and respectability. Mobility aids thus serve as an index of different moments in moral careers of progress and decline, while their complementarity or incompatibility with public infrastructure is instrumental in creating and disaggregating social assemblages of disabled people. Through the rise and collapse of border trade between Kinshasa and Brazzaville, I discuss how crutches, cargo tricycles, wheelchairs and ferries shaped socialities and subjectivities over the long term. Considering the role of technology problematizes analyses of moral careers of personhood as attributed by others, drawing attention to personal agency and entanglement with a socio-technical environment. © The Author(s), 2022.

Alleviation of Different Climatic Conditions by Foliar Application of Salicylic Acid and Sodium Nitroprusside and Their Interactive Effects on Pigments and Sugar Content of Maize Under Different Sowing Dates,"The agricultural sector is seriously impacted by climate change, leading to potential risks to food security. In terms of global food production, maize ranks third. As a result, crop production and food security depend critically on assessing the effects of climate change and developing measures to adapt maize. Regarding adaptability, changing planting dates and using different agrochemicals are more effective than other management. Crop models are part of a global decision support system to help farmers maximize yields despite unpredictable weather patterns. To mitigate yield loss and protect the ecosystem, it is essential to use efficient maize-sowing practices in the field. This experiment was carried out to identify the most favorable sowing dates that maximize yield while ensuring the crop's productivity and the integrity of the surrounding ecosystem remain intact. The main aim of this experiment was to mitigate the different climatic conditions by exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on pigments and sugar content in maize under different sowing dates. A field experiment was carried out in the School of Agriculture, Lovely Professional University, Punjab, India, during the spring season of 2022. The experiment dealt with various maize crops, PMH-10, sourced from the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Punjab. The experiment was conducted in an open-air environment. The experimental setup was laid out in a split-plot design. The results stated that foliar application of salicylic acid and sodium nitroprusside successfully influenced high-temperature tolerance and low temperature at the reproductive phase and initial vegetative stages with other growing climatic conditions of maize in early and late sowings when controlled by increasing the chlorophyll index, carotenoids content, and sugar content of maize. © 2024 Technoscience Publications.

Latest biotechnology tools and targets for improving abiotic stress tolerance in protein legumes,"Protein legumes are among the most important crops for sustainable agriculture and global food security for decades to come. Unfortunately, they are subject to several abiotic stresses that severely limit their productivity, and this phenomenon is increasing with climate change. New Plant Breeding Technologies (NPBTs) offer novel alternatives to improve the plant performance of crops against such environmental constraints. However, the recalcitrance to transgenesis and in vitro regeneration has delayed such advances for protein legumes. This article reviews recent advances in legume crop biotechnological approaches to improve their tolerance to abiotic stresses including drought, high salinity, heat and cold, and heavy metal stress. In addition to these improvements, obtained mainly through transgenesis, we surveyed the application of tools such as CRISPR/Cas and RNA interference in legumes in a context of abiotic stress tolerance, and suggested a path to follow for gene control by these tools in legume plants, organs, or cells. Furthermore, we also discussed promising molecular targets, perspectives, and the way ahead for enhancing abiotic stress tolerance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Synergistic effects of clove fruit extract and nano-silicon to enhance drought resilience and productivity of soybean through improved plant defense mechanisms,"Clove fruit extract (CFE) and nano-silicon particles (Si-NPs) are promising natural and nanotechnological solutions to enhance drought resilience and improve soybean productivity as a crop critically affected by water scarcity. This study specifically focused on how the foliar application of CFE (5%) and/or Si-NPs (1.5 mM), influences plant health and productivity under three irrigation regimes based on crop evapotranspiration (ETc), which were 100% ETc (well-watered), 75% ETc (moderate drought stress), and 50% ETc (high drought stress). The study assessed multiple dimensions including plant development, leaf anatomy, physiological and biochemical responses, antioxidant defense mechanisms, nutrient content, and yield performance. The results revealed that moderate and high drought stress significantly reduced stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, net photosynthetic rate, membrane stability index, photochemical activity, and relative water content. These physiological declines were linked to structural reductions in blade, phloem, spongy, palisade, and xylem thickness, which led to a decrease in leaf area, plant height, chlorophyll content, and nutrient levels, ultimately impairing crop yield. However, the application of CFE and Si-NPs mitigated these adverse effects, with considerable improvements in all measured parameters under drought conditions. These enhancements were associated with increased antioxidant enzyme activities, proline, soluble sugars, total soluble carbohydrates, glutathione, and α-tocopherol. Among the treatments, the combined application of CFE and Si-NPs proved most effective, improving soybean biological yield by 31% under severe drought stress compared to the control. This investigation indicated an environmentally sustainable approach for bolstering soybean resilience and productivity under water-limited conditions. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysis of gaps and possible interventions for improving water productivity in crop livestock systems of ethiopia,"Low crop and livestock productivities in the mixed farming systems of Ethiopia hamper efforts to meet the increasing food demands from a stressed natural resource base. Important reasons for the low agricultural productivity are water scarcity and poor spatial and temporal rainfall distribution. Although improving agricultural water productivity would safeguard people's livelihoods and the environment, the lack of information on best bet interventions and strategies to achieve this impedes targeted decision making. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct an ex-ante evaluation of the potential effect of selected interventions on livestock water productivity (LWP) in mixed crop-livestock systems. Baseline data were collected from a water scarce area in the Ethiopian highlands. An analysis of productivity gaps and stakeholder interviews helped to identify promising interventions, which were categorized in three groups related to feed, water and animal management. A spreadsheet model was developed that was composed of the various production components of the farming system, their interactions and influencing factors. By linking water use for feed production with livestock products through the energy supplied by the feeds, the potential effect of interventions on LWP could be simulated. The evaluation showed that the various interventions targeting feed, water and animal management could result in LWP improvements ranging from 4 to 94%. Feed and energy water productivity increased particularly with interventions like fertilizer application, and the introduction of fodder trees, concentrates, improved food-feed crops, and soil and water conservation measures. Combining the different interventions led to a stronger improvement than any of the single interventions. The results of the evaluation can inform policy-makers and development actors on which best bets to promote and invest in. © 2011, Cambridge University Press.

Decision-Making in a Closed-Loop Supply Chain under Fairness Concerns and Optimal Subsidies,"Government subsidies have played an important role in closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) waste utilization. However, when the retailer is disadvantaged in the supply chain cooperation and does not have access to subsidies, fairness issues may arise that affect pricing and subsidies. Therefore, this study aims to examine the optimal solutions for a government-led CLSC with remanufacturing subsidies and fairness concerns. We develop a three-echelon game with a government, a manufacturer, and a fairness-concerned retailer and derive the solutions for four scenarios: the fairness-neutral model, without fairness issues; the retailer has fairness concerns about the distribution of supply chain profits, and the concerned behavior is recognized by the manufacturer; the retailer is fairness-concerned, but the manufacturer ignores the concerned behavior; and the centralized scenario. Through the comparative analysis of different models, we design a cooperation mechanism for enterprises. Then, the conclusions are verified by numerical experiments. This study shows the following: (1) The retailer is always willing to maintain fairness concerns, but this does not affect the amount of collection. (2) The government will consume more subsidies because of the fairness issue ignored by the manufacturer. (3) Only when unit waste pollution is relatively low while the degree of fairness concerns is significant, will the manufacturer recognize the fairness concerns to reduce its unfavorable impact on profit. The increase in the level of concern can bring more benefits for two enterprises by consuming more subsidies for the highly polluting wastes. (4) A two-part tariff contract can coordinate the enterprises and promote social welfare within a certain parameter range. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The socio-economic impact of sea-level rise on the Netherlands: A study of possible scenarios,"This paper describes a simulation study of some of the socio-economic consequences of a rise in sea level on Dutch society. A computer simulation model for the greenhouse problem has been developed, which tries to capture the climate change cause-effect relationship for a combination of greenhouse-gas emissions. The impact of emissions of greenhouse gases on global temperature and sea-level rise can be calculated using the model. Additionally, separate, independent modules have been implemented in order to quantify the socio-economic consequences for the Netherlands. Four consistent sets of scenarios have been developed, based on differences in economic growth, energy use, international environmental measures, etc. On the basis of these scenarios estimates are made of the costs of coastal defence and water management in the Netherlands as a result of adaptation to the impacts of sea-level rise. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Not About Sufficiency
The impact of sinkholes on crop choices in water-scarce regions,"Irrigation is crucial in enhancing agricultural productivity, which is vital for ensuring food security. However, overusing water for irrigation, often due to weak water resource management, leads to groundwater depletion and sinkhole formation. This problem is particularly salient in our research region in Turkey, a water-poor area where farmers intensively irrigate their crops despite limited precipitation and irrigation resources. The expansion of irrigated farmlands in this region has resulted in hundreds of sinkholes, posing serious threats to both the land and the livelihoods dependent on it. This study uses detailed micro-level datasets and panel data econometric techniques to estimate the impact of sinkhole occurrences on farmers’ decisions concerning crop cultivation. Our findings show that despite recurrent sinkhole incidents, farmers persist in their existing farming practices, showing a marked insensitivity to the escalating environmental consequences. This evidence underscores the urgent need for effective policy interventions to regulate water usage and promote more sustainable irrigation techniques. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"Diversity, Spatial Distribution, Breeding Status, Production Level, and Use Dynamics Analysis of Food Barley in Ethiopia","Barley is a significant cereal crop in Ethiopia, known for its rich genetic diversity, which includes both hulled and hull-less types adapted to the diverse agroecological zones of the country. This diversity is crucial for breeding programs aimed at developing improved varieties that can withstand various stresses. The spatial distribution of barley in Ethiopia is extensive, from the highlands to midaltitude areas, with the crop particularly well-suited to the cool and moist conditions found in the highlands. Barley breeding in Ethiopia has made significant progress, with the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR) and other institutions focusing on traits such as disease resistance, drought tolerance, and improved grain quality. Barley production in Ethiopia is substantial, with the crop grown both for food and feed. It faces challenges such as low productivity, limited access to improved varieties and inputs, and the impact of climate change. Despite these challenges, barley plays a vital role in food security, income generation, and cultural practices. The use dynamics of barley in Ethiopia are varied, with traditional uses including the production of injera, beer, and other food products. There is also an increasing interest in barley for its potential in the production of malt for the brewing industry and as a source of high-quality protein for animal feed. Finally, barley is an important cereal crop in Ethiopia, with significant genetic diversity, spatial distribution across various altitudes, breeding progress toward improved varieties, production challenges and opportunities, and diverse uses in food, feed, and industry. Ongoing research and development efforts are essential to enhance the productivity and sustainability of barley in Ethiopia for the current and future. Copyright © 2025 Asaye Demelash et al.

Transparency in the WTO's decision-making,"In almost 20 years of existence, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has managed to be at the forefront of public discussions on international organizations (IOs). Transparency in the WTO decision-making has been on the agenda of the multilateral trading system for several years. Pressures from developing countries, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the civil society in particular have led to significant improvements towards more openness and participation in the WTO decision-making. This article posits the WTO within the current debates about more institutional transparency in IOs. It discusses the current features of good governance in the WTO decision-making and the consensus rule in particular, in an attempt to identify the pros and cons of this voting tradition in a modern IO. It also discusses the recent selection of the new WTO Director-General. A central insight of the paper is that input and output transparency of the WTO could be further enhanced by increased, managed participation of NGOs. As the WTO is gradually becoming a genuine IO in terms of membership and gets involved in global discussions relating to finance, climate change, or poverty eradication, public scrutiny will only increase and thus improved governance is an irreversible process. However, divergences in the views of WTO Members as to the proper scope of WTO input and output transparency will most probably lead to extended negotiations. Some thoughts about the future prospects of and possible avenues for the WTO system are also identified. © 2014 Foundation of the Leiden Journal of International Law .",Not About Sufficiency
Towards a standard framework to identify green infrastructure key elements in dense mediterranean cities,"Present-day dense cities are increasingly affected by the impacts associated with climate change. The recurrence of extreme climate events is projected to be intensified in cities in the next decades, especially in the most vulnerable areas of the world, such as the Mediterranean region. In this context, the urban green infrastructure (UGI) is presented as a nature-based solution that directly contributes to climate change mitigation in Mediterranean compact cities and improves health, social, welfare, and environmental conditions for inhabitants. This research sets out a manageable framework to define, locate, and categorize more functional green urban and peri-urban areas in a dense Mediterranean city. It takes spatial distribution, extension, and the capacity to improve inhabitants’ wellbeing through the provision of ecosystem services as classification criteria. Results show a scenario with a greater functional green surface available for the citizens to be managed. Identified areas have been categorized as cores, nodes, links, and green spaces defined as “other” areas. In particular, the latter play a significant role at social, structural, and ecological levels. The study showcases that rethinking urban design and strategic decision-making around these areas can enhance green equity in Mediterranean dense cities, their capacity to better deal with environmental extremes, and the inhabitants’ engagement with a culture of sustainability and wellbeing. © 2020 by the authors.

Harnessing resource wealth for inclusive growth in fragile Western African states,"Fragile countries face competing needs for allocating valuable natural resource potential, including for using the resource revenue to scale up public investment and close large infrastructure gaps. This paper uses the recently developed Debt, Investment, Growth and Natural Resources (DIGNAR) model to characterise optimal allocations of resource wealth, with a focus on the particular economic structures of fragile countries. This study adds to the existing literature by not only carefully applying the DIGNAR model to quantify key policy trade-offs facing resource-rich fragile Western African countries such as Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, but also by extending the model to account for the possibility of direct social transfers and of an endogeneous determination of the investment path based on fiscal rules. Key results, with far-reaching policy implications for accelerating inclusive growth stand out from the simulations. First, compared with a conservative approach based on the permanent income analysis, a sustainable non-resource deficit target is robust to the high uncertainty of resource revenues, while delivering growth benefits through higher productive public capital. Second, distributing part of resource revenues as transfers raises private consumption immediately, suggesting that a fraction of the resource revenue could be used to expand safety nets in fragile states. © The Author 2017.

"Hydrogeochemical characterization and indicators of anthropogenic influence in groundwater around Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","The global demand for water sources for human consumption has been increasing over the last century. The degradation of water bodies and aquifers has made the planning and management of these natural resources crucial. In this context, this study focuses on the hydrogeochemical characterization of aquifers surrounding the of Guanabara Bay Hydrographic Region (GBHR), located in Rio de Janeiro, which stands out as an area with a high population density associated with elevated levels of environmental degradation. A total of 228 wells were analyzed, separated by aquifer types, resulting in 138 fissured and 90 porous aquifers, predominantly sodium-rich groundwaters. This predominance this hydrochemical facies can be attributed to the influence of the saline influence, given the proximity to the ocean, and anthropogenic activities, such as the discharge of industrial and urban effluents, which alter the chemical composition of groundwater. From the mixing diagram, it was found that most of the sampled wells are in the field of silicate rocks for both types of aquifers. In porous aquifers, a significant number of wells under greater influence of effluents/evaporites were observed in the eastern portion of GBHR, whereas in fissured aquifers, effluents/evaporites are predominantly concentrated in the western portion of the study area. The high variability of the Inorganic Chemical Index may indicate zones of point or diffuse pollution, influenced by effluent discharges, surface runoff, and contaminant infiltration. This variation reveals a distinctive pattern related to land use and aquifer type in the studied region when observed spatially. The use of a multivariate statistical technique (factor analysis) corroborates the influence of natural processes, like weathering and seawater intrusion in wells close to the coast and the anthropogenic processes, such as domestic/agricultural/industrial effluents influence in wells far from the coast. This study highlights the importance of understanding the hydrogeochemistry of aquifers in urban and industrial areas, not only for the preservation of the local ecosystem but also for public health and sustainable development. The results point to the need for integrated water resource management policies that consider both environmental conservation and economic development, thus ensuring a balance between the use and protection of groundwater around Guanabara Bay. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptations to climate change and climate variability in the agriculture sector in Mauritius: Lessons from a technical needs assessment,"Like many Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Mauritius is highly vulnerable to the impacts of Climate Change (CC) and Climate Variability (CV).

Lethal heatwaves are challenging India’s sustainable development,"Due to the unprecedented burdens on public health, agriculture, and other socio-economic and cultural systems, climate change-induced heatwaves in India can hinder or reverse the country’s progress in fulfilling the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Moreover, the Indian government’s reliance on its Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI), which may underestimate the impact of heatwaves on the country’s developmental efforts. An analytical evaluation of heat index (HI) with CVI shows that more than 90% of the country is at extremely cautious or dangerous levels of adversely impacting adaptive livelihood capacity, food grains yield, vector-borne disease spread and urban sustainability. The results also show by examining Delhi’s urban heat risk that heatwaves will critically hamper SDG progress at the urban scale. Linking HI with CVI identifies more of India’s vulnerability and provides an opportunity to rethink India’s climate adaptation policies through international cooperation in designing holistic vulnerability assessment methodologies. The conclusion emphasizes the urgent need to improve extreme weather impact assessment by combining multiple layers of information within the existing climate vulnerability measurement frameworks that can account for the co-occurrence and collision of climate change events and non-climate structural SDG interventions. © 2023 Debnath et al.

Safe and just operating spaces for regional social-ecological systems,"Humanity faces a major global challenge in achieving wellbeing for all, while simultaneously ensuring that the biophysical processes and ecosystem services that underpin wellbeing are exploited within scientifically informed boundaries of sustainability. We propose a framework for defining the safe and just operating space for humanity that integrates social wellbeing into the original planetary boundaries concept (Rockström et al., 2009a,b) for application at regional scales. We argue that such a framework can: (1) increase the policy impact of the boundaries concept as most governance takes place at the regional rather than planetary scale (2) contribute to the understanding and dissemination of complexity thinking throughout governance and policy-making; (3) act as a powerful metaphor and communication tool for regional equity and sustainability. We demonstrate the approach in two rural Chinese localities where we define the safe and just operating space that lies between an environmental ceiling and a social foundation from analysis of time series drawn from monitored and palaeoecological data, and from social survey statistics respectively. Agricultural intensification has led to poverty reduction, though not eradicated it, but at the expense of environmental degradation. Currently, the environmental ceiling is exceeded for degraded water quality at both localities even though the least well-met social standards are for available piped water and sanitation. The conjunction of these social needs and environmental constraints around the issue of water access and quality illustrates the broader value of the safe and just operating space approach for sustainable development. © 2014 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Citizens' attitudes towards climate mitigation policies: The role of occupational exposure in EU countries,"Climate protection is a global public good. The related mitigation policies implemented by a single country could have little effect on climate change issue such that there could be no net gains for society. However, those measures might create winners and losers among individuals. We investigate the citizens' support for different pro-climate policies in EU countries, by considering the degree of heterogeneity in their attitudes towards climate issues using a cluster analysis. We also exploit the extent to which carbon intensity and green skills requirement of jobs contribute to supporting climate policies. Our results suggest that individuals' occupational exposure does matter: people in emission-intensive activities tend to be against stringent climate measures, whereas people in jobs that require high levels of green skills are in favour of them. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Valuation of health benefits of green-blue areas for the purpose of ecosystem accounting: a pilot in Flanders, Belgium","In recent years, a vast amount of scientific literature has highlighted the benefits of nearby green space for physical and mental health, but the large variation in scope, methods and indicators used in these studies hampers the assessment of these benefits in the context of natural capital accounting. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first studies to quantify and value these benefits in the context of natural capital accounting. A method was developed and applied to the Flemish Region in Belgium for 2013 and 2016. The physical supply and use accounts for health are based on a set of selected dose-effect relationships that quantify the impact of the availability of greenspace on seven specific indicators for physical and mental health, including mortality, cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes and depression. The indicator for green-blue areas is the percentage of green-blue areas in total land use, calculated for 0.5, 1 and 3 km radius from the residence, based on detailed land-use maps (10 m x 10 m) for Flanders, Belgium. The base-line data for mortality and illness are average data for the Flemish Region. These health impacts are weighted using Daly's (disability-adjusted life years) and aggregated. The total health benefits due to the availability of green-blue areas for the total Flemish population was estimated at almost 85,000 DALYs. This is 27% of the estimated total burden of disease in Flanders in 2016 for the seven selected diseases. The monetary accounts are based on a detailed assessment for mortality and morbidity of three different cost components, i.e. avoided medical costs (e.g. hospitalisation) and avoided absenteeism and welfare loss due to suffering and reduced life expectancy. Productivity gains from avoided absenteeism is valued, based on statistics on absenteeism for specific diseases for and labour market data from Belgium and account for 52% of the total monetary value of green spaces. Cost of illness is valued, based on market data and illness specific studies for Belgium or Europe and account for 36% of total values. Welfare gains from increased life expectancy are valued on the basis of European studies for the VOLY (value of a life year lost), based on the simulated exchange value for the willingness-to-pay for increased life expectancy. This accounts for 12% of the total monetary value of green space. The total monetary benefits amount to 464 Euro per inhabitant per year or 3 billion Euro per year for Flanders. This corresponds to 1.3% of the GDP, which reflects the importance of these benefits. The methodology is incomplete as not all health indicators are covered, mainly due to a lack of dose-effect relationships. The research priority for potential users of the accounts is a better indicator for contact with green space that does differentiate between ecosystems, their quality, accessibility or their use. This requires more systematic health impact studies that take these elements into account, as well as more systematic data on the daily use of green space by citizens. In the meantime, an additional set of condition accounts on these elements can be used, especially to follow changes in quality and use of green-blue areas over time. © De Nocker L et al.",Not About Sufficiency
Governance and wild food plant value chains: a look at the Brazilian context,"As an answer to the topic, ""Does local, national, and international governance have a primary role in shaping the resilience of local ecological knowledge?"" we explore the context of governance and wild food plant (WFP) value chains in Brazil. We chose to focus on WFP value chains because they are often deeply embedded with local ecological knowledge. We argue that: (1) the development or abandonment of public policies can significantly boost or hinder these value chains; (2) WFP harvesters face challenges in accessing national public policies that could support and promote these value chains; and (3) Brazilian policies must consider the specific land ownership issues affecting WFP harvesting communities. Additionally, we will discuss the main challenges in promoting and strengthening WFP value chains and how governance can address these issues. © The Author(s) 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Peasant agroecological systems as new frontiers of exploitation?,"In view of the Aichi international policy targets to expand areas under conservation, we analyze to what extent conservation has become an inherent element of extraction. We scrutinize the Land Sparing versus Land Sharing debate by explicitly incorporating environmental justice issues of access to land an d natural resources. We contend that dominant conservation regimes, embedded within Land Sparing, legitimize the displacement of local people and their land use to compensate for distant, unsustainable resource use. In contrast, the Land Sharing counternarrative, by promoting spatial integration of conservation in agroecological systems, has the potential to radically challenge extraction. Common ground emerges around the concept of sustainable intensification. We contend that if inserted in green economy's technocentric and efficiency-oriented framework, sustainable intensification will contribute to undermining diversified peasant agroecological systems by transforming them into simplified, export-orientated ones, thereby stripping peasant communities of the capacity to provide for their own needs. © Berghahn Books.",Not About Sufficiency
"Socio-environmental vulnerability, disaster risk-reduction and resilience-building - lessons from the earthquake in Haiti and torrential rains in the mountain range close to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil","Data on disasters around the world reveal greater seriousness in countries with lower social and economic development levels. In this context, disaster risk-reduction and resilience building policies are priorities in the sustainable development agenda, featuring among the topics selected for the Rio+20 Summit. By means of a contribution of a conceptual nature and from examples of disasters in countries with different development levels, namely the Haiti earthquake and the torrential rains in the mountain range close to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, the scope of this article is to demonstrate how socio-environmental vulnerability creates conditions for disasters, while at the same time limiting strategies for their prevention and mitigation. Lastly, some of the measures that disaster risk reduction and resilience- building demand in a socio-environmental vulnerability context are highlighted. These involve changes in the current patterns of social, economic and environmental development geared toward ecological sustainability and social justice as pillars of sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
No Planet-B Attitudes: The Main Driver of Gen Z Travelers’ Willingness to Pay for Sustainable Tourism Destinations,"With consumers becoming increasingly aware of the effects of human activity on the environment, tourism products and destinations are increasingly marketed as sustainable and socially responsible. As most sustainable practices lead to additional costs, and tourists’ decisions tend to be price sensitive, achieving sustainability goals necessarily involves understanding how much more tourists are willing to pay for sustainable practices as well as the antecedents of such willingness to pay (WTP). The present study aims to advance knowledge on the antecedents of WTP for sustainable destinations (WTP-4-SD), for which it builds on previous studies employing the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP). In this context, a theoretical model involving ecotourism attitudes, environmental beliefs, climate change-related risk perceptions (CC-RRP), environmental concern during trip (ECDT), and sustainable consumption behavior (SCB) as antecedents of WTP-4-SD is proposed. The model was tested based on data collected through an online survey from a sample of 847 Spanish and Portuguese Gen Z travelers and analyzed through Structural Equations Modeling (SEM). The findings suggest that a cohesive set of attitudes and beliefs regarding the man–nature relationship, the risks of climate change, and the role of tourism—which have been labeled “No Planet-B Attitudes”—is the main driver of WTP-4-SD. The effects of SCB and ECDT on WTP-4-SD have also been confirmed—although the latter is quite small—as well as those of No Planet-B Attitudes on both. The findings bring about insights into young travelers’ attitudes towards nature and the role of tourism in sustainable development, as well as useful implications for sustainable tourism planning and marketing. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Use of simulation model to evaluate the use of vegetable oil in a new refining process for diesel using existing installations,"The current concern over sustainable development has presented the need to define new limits for automobile emissions and researchers have been looking for economical, renewable, less polluting fuels. In this context, the H-Bio process was developed. This technology uses vegetable oil to replace up to 10% of the raw materials needed to produce diesel in a refinery and uses the currently installed equipments. However, such change has impacts in the storage and handling of the products involved in the diesel producing process. In order to evaluate these impacts, Petrobras has been using simulation models, whose greatest advantage is their flexibility to test parameters and configurations and to foresee the consequences of new stock politics and new processes without the need to actually build or redesign plants. Using the joint analysis of the input parameters and results, it is possible to detect operational bottlenecks, plot comparative graphs and analyse the results of new investments, searching for cost-reducing opportunities and substantiating technical and managerial decisions regarding stock optimization. In this paper, we shall present the application of one such model in a study in Petrobras' largest refinery, which has had to change substantially its storage facilities and diesel-forming process to account for the H-Bio and keep up with the new, stricter environmental restrictions to Brazilian diesel. From the model's output, the number of tanks needed by each product involved was inferred and the best way to schedule the receiving and using of vegetal oil was chosen without restriction introduction.",Not About Sufficiency
"Social determinants of health, universal health coverage, and sustainable development: Case studies from Latin American countries","Many intrinsically related determinants of health and disease exist, including social and economic status, education, employment, housing, and physical and environmental exposures. These factors interact to cumulatively affect health and disease burden of individuals and populations, and to establish health inequities and disparities across and within countries. Biomedical models of health care decrease adverse consequences of disease, but are not enough to effectively improve individual and population health and advance health equity. Social determinants of health are especially important in Latin American countries, which are characterised by adverse colonial legacies, tremendous social injustice, huge socioeconomic disparities, and wide health inequities. Poverty and inequality worsened substantially in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s in these countries. Many Latin American countries have introduced public policies that integrate health, social, and economic actions, and have sought to develop health systems that incorporate multisectoral interventions when introducing universal health coverage to improve health and its upstream determinants. We present case studies from four Latin American countries to show the design and implementation of health programmes underpinned by intersectoral action and social participation that have reached national scale to effectively address social determinants of health, improve health outcomes, and reduce health inequities. Investment in managerial and political capacity, strong political and managerial commitment, and state programmes, not just time-limited government actions, have been crucial in underpinning the success of these policies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Circles of coastal sustainability: A framework for coastal management,"The coastal zone is a space where many social, economic, and political activities intersect with natural processes. In this paper, we present an adaptation of the method of 'Circles of Sustainability', used to provide a visual assessment of indicators that define sustainability profiles for cities. It is used as a basis for a 'Circles of Coastal Sustainability' (CCS) framework that can be used at multiple spatial scales to assess indicators of critical processes that facilitate/constrain sustainability of the world's coastal zones. The development of such a framework can support management by identifying key features that influence environmental sustainability and human well-being. CCS presents a holistic assessment of four interdependent boundary domains: Environment and Ecology, Social and Cultural, Economics, and Governance and Policy. This approach improves its utility and usability for decision-makers and researchers. CCS adds to existing assessment frameworks that are often focused on particular themes and/or domains that confine their utility to the context of sustainable development and the UN Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, which demand an inherently holistic and integrated evaluation. CCS is a holistic framework designed to assess the boundaries to sustainability for socio-ecological systems at multiple scales for the world's coasts. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate change in the Sundarban delta and the need for green management,"Sundarban, covering southern parts of West Bengal (India) and Bangladesh, is tiger-reserve core area of 10,000 sq.km., plus fringe area forest with villages. It is the sea-facing part of world’s largest delta, through which rivers Ganga (Padma) and Bhagirathi flow into the Bay of Bengal-branching into hundreds of rivers and creeks. Sundarban eco-system is unique in housing a wide variety of flora (world’s largest mangrove forest) diverse fauna (home for Royal Bengal Tiger) and at least 2500 years of human settlement on land, and an interestingly rich aquatic collect on like fishes, dolphins, crocodiles and Olive Ridley turtles in water. All these made Sundarban worth saving as “World Heritage”, as declared by UN bodies. But the delicate ecological balance of this complex eco-system has now been affected badly by climate changes, triggered mainly by global warming. Two global warming effects-(i) rising sea level, eating up land in Sundarban, and (ii) shortening of Himalayan glaciers reducing the flow of fresh river water and subsequently increasing salinity of river and so l water in Sundarban—in particular, threaten life in Sundarban for plants, animals and human beings. Super-cyclone cum tsunami of 2009 flooded farmlands and ponds of Sundarban with sea-water. All these have lowered the already low income of its inhabitants to the stage of half–starvation and led to exodus of ~ 70 % of men to various cities of India. The left-out population with highly reduced male population is a major social problem, added to the already existing economic problem. Projects like luxury tourism at commercial scale ship-breaking and petro-chemical industries have been proposed with the advertised goal of generating new income avenues for the poor inhabitants. We firstly show that these projects are likely to further harm the delicate environment and life in Sundarban, and also damage the Sundarban economy in the long run. Secondly, Sundarban residents have no training to get these jobs and recreational tours by outsiders in Sundarban can create more socio-economic problems among them. So, we develop alternative green solutions to the problems arising from climate change and global warming Re-introduction of traditional cultivation of fruits, vegetables, chilly, paddy and pulses in Sundarban, better transport, solar energy, electrification and fish- and food-preservation industries-green avenues to give good income to the inhabitants-must replace the non-green city-centric projects. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",Not About Sufficiency
"Pedotechnique applications in large-scale farming: Economic value, soil ecosystems services and soil security","Since ancient times Humans and Soil have experienced interwoven links. Nowadays soil scientists continue to stress such links highlighting the importance of soil in: i) satisfying the ever growing Human demand for food, water and energy, and ii) providing ecosystem services that mitigate climate changes, influence human health and improve biodiversity. Pedotechniques are recently used to generate soils suitable for table grape cultivation in order to increase productivity and grape quality, thus to get substantial financial returns. We show one emblematic study case of pedotechniques applied in Sicily (Italy). Aims of the investigation were: i) stressing threats to soil security derived by the generation of anthropogenic soils, ii) assessing the economic sustainability of pedotechniques and table grape production, taking into consideration only the internal factors and excluding the external economic contributions that are allocated to social sustainability and iii) stressing the role of soil science to focus on “economic value” to the soil ecosystem services and degradation processes. Results highlight that soil transformations allow for considerable investment costs. The highest productivity and the consequent higher profitability of the cultivation amortize the start-up costs. From the other side transformations could trigger considerable deterioration of both soil ecosystem services and environmental quality. In order to stress this last aspect and to define the relationships between pedotechnique application and soil security we have considered the five soil security dimensions (i.e. capability, condition, capital, connectivity and codification). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
CLIMATE CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT ETHICS AFTER AMARTYA SEN,"Global climate change challenges conventional approaches to the ethical thinking behind Third World development, which relies on free market mechanisms to improve quality of life. Amartya Sen also challenges these approaches to development in his controversial book Development as Freedom (1999). This chapter re-examines Sen’s call for development as a socially led process that encourages freedom, with economic growth playing a subordinate role. His theory demands integrated, balanced decision-making on the part of governments, institutions and community representatives participating in development projects. In the second part of the chapter, a brief description of the Enlightenment origins contributing to the evolution of Western individualism and consumption habits serves as background for discussion of various approaches to environmental ethics. The thinking of Denis Goulet and Sen is combined to propose a model for collaborative decision-making among equal power stakeholders mediated by belief in values supporting a balance between ecological well-being and human development. Faith in such values will be required to appropriately prioritize competing or inconsistent beliefs and inspire the breakthrough creativity that will be essential to resolve the ongoing inequities of human development while simultaneously reversing the environmental damage caused by such development. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Purushottama Bilimoria and Amy Rayner; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
Natural resources and development: new insights from strong curse to strong blessing,"We revisit the nonconsensual econometric works – although the natural resource curse may have flourished – on the relationship between natural resources and economic performance. We first question the two terms of the relationship. We consider the role of institutions (separately and in interaction with the variable of interest) and of a number of usual or new control variables (income inequality and current account). The model, based on development accounting, is tested using four econometric techniques on the full sample (130 countries, 1990–2019) and by sub-samples according to per capita income, illustrating the non-linearity of the relationship. Three stylized facts emerge: first, the overall results converge towards a strong blessing of resource rents on GDP per capita. This can be explained mainly by the role of these rents in countries with very high GDP per capita. Second, institutional variables significantly mitigate the negative effect or reinforce the positive effect of these resources on development. Finally, among the categories of resources considered, it is the oil rent that favors this strong natural resource blessing. The effects of the observed categories may offset each other. Detailed analyses of estimation’s results in sub-samples and articulated with the results of the full sample are also proposed. © The Author(s), 2025.",Not About Sufficiency
Air conditioning and global inequality,"As global temperatures go up and incomes rise, air conditioner sales are poised to increase dramatically. Recent studies explore the potential economic and environmental impacts of this growth, but relatively little attention has been paid to the implications for inequality. In this paper we use household-level microdata from 16 countries to characterize empirically the relationship between climate, income, and residential air conditioning. We show that both current and future air conditioner usage is concentrated among high-income households. Not only do richer countries have much more air conditioning than poorer countries, but within countries adoption is highly concentrated among high-income households. The pattern of adoption is particularly stark in relatively low-income countries such as Pakistan, where we show that the vast majority of adoption between now and 2050 will be concentrated among the upper income tercile. We use our model to forecast future adoption, show how patterns vary across countries and income levels, and discuss what these patterns mean for health, productivity, and educational inequality. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Will China's economy avoid the doldrums?,"Ken Davies, President, Growing Capacity Inc., formerly of the OECD Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs, discusses the Chinese economy. GDP growth in China has fallen from the 10%-plus rates of the past two decades. It decelerated from 10.4% in 2010 to 9.3% in 2011 and 7.8% in 2012, and edged lower to 7.7% in the first quarter of 2013. Both leading and lagging indicators in China suggest that growth is continuing to slow. The government's top priority is always social stability, which also means political stability, which is rightly felt to be threatened if living standards drop, by income reductions, rapid inflation and/or high unemployment. As the OECD's China surveys have shown, urbanization alone will keep growth high over at least the next decade, provided there is no financial collapse.

Nutrients in the nexus,"Synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer has enabled modern agriculture to greatly improve human nutrition during the twentieth century, but it has also created unintended human health and environmental pollution challenges for the twenty-first century. Averaged globally, about half of the fertilizer-N applied to farms is removed with the crops, while the other half remains in the soil or is lost from farmers’ fields, resulting in water and air pollution. As human population continues to grow and food security improves in the developing world, the dual development goals of producing more nutritious food with low pollution will require both technological and socio-economic innovations in agriculture. Two case studies presented here, one in sub-Saharan Africa and the other in Midwestern United States, demonstrate how management of nutrients, water, and energy is inextricably linked in both small-scale and large-scale food production, and that science-based solutions to improve the efficiency of nutrient use can optimize food production while minimizing pollution. To achieve the needed large increases in nutrient use efficiency, however, technological developments must be accompanied by policies that recognize the complex economic and social factors affecting farmer decision-making and national policy priorities. Farmers need access to affordable nutrient supplies and support information, and the costs of improving efficiencies and avoiding pollution may need to be shared by society through innovative policies. Success will require interdisciplinary partnerships across public and private sectors, including farmers, private sector crop advisors, commodity supply chains, government agencies, university research and extension, and consumers. © 2016, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental justice: insights from an interdisciplinary instructional workshop,"Environmental justice recognizes the connections between social and environmental concerns and interrogates power dynamics related to environmental issues. Courses in environmental studies and the geosciences provide an opportunity, and perhaps an obligation to explore environmental justice, but few resources exist to help instructors do so effectively. A 2013 interdisciplinary workshop at Carleton College sponsored by InTeGrate—Interdisciplinary Teaching of Geoscience for a Sustainable Future—convened instructors interested in environmental justice as a topic of instruction and produced a series of insights and challenges for doing so. Environmental justice instruction provides opportunities to tackle tough issues of race, class, and privilege in a variety of disciplinary contexts particularly in geoscience courses, where course content regarding hazards, climate change, and other topics may contain social justice components which are not often included in instruction. Teaching environmental justice, though, presents a number of challenges: how can instructors teach the conceptual and theoretical explanations of environmental justice while giving students the necessary tools to address environmental injustices?

Optimizing the health benefits of climate change policies using health impact assessment,"Health impact assessment (HIA) is a tool that can be used to examine the potential health impacts of proposed climate change policies and offer recommendations to promote health and mitigate adverse health consequences of such policies. We used an HIA database, a literature search, and expert consultation to identify 12 HIAs of the proposed climate change policies from six states in the U.S. These policies included cap-and-trade legislation, heat-wave and sea-level-rise mitigation and adaptation, transportation policy impacts of climate change, carbon-reduction strategy scenarios, soil- and water-conservation strategies, urban forest canopy for climate adaptation, overheating buildings, and regional transportation plan and sustainable communities strategies. In four descriptive summaries, we found that HIAs foster stakeholder engagement and provide useful health-promoting recommendations. HIAs can facilitate cross-sector collaboration, help optimize the health co-benefits of climate change policies, and raise awareness among decision makers of health impacts of those proposed policies. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Causes and implications of groundwater depletion in India: A review,"Groundwater plays a vital role in food security, water availability, and economic growth of more than 1.3 billion people in India. Notwithstanding the development of irrigation schemes based on surface water, groundwater remains a primary source of irrigation in large parts of the country. The Green revolution in the 1970s contributed considerably to increasing food production in India through the development of groundwater-based irrigation, which resulted in an expansion of irrigated area and a rapid rise in the number of electric and diesel pumps. A large part of the rain-fed area was converted to irrigated agriculture leading to growing multiple crops in a year with increased crop yields. While the expansion in groundwater-based irrigation helped meet the rising food demands of a large population of India, it has resulted in several environmental implications. Groundwater depletion in India has now become one of the most prominent challenges for food and water security. Both in-situ and satellite-based observations indicate a rapid decline in groundwater storage in north India. Both natural and anthropogenic factors cause groundwater depletion in India. Groundwater pumping for irrigation remains the primary driver of groundwater depletion, which can further affect food and water security in India under climate change. Both in-situ and satellite-based measurements have issues and uncertainty. Land surface hydrological models provide essential insights in understanding the groundwater storage variability; however, need improvements in the representation of complex processes related to climate-human interactions. Sustainable management of groundwater in India is vital for tackling growing challenges related to water availability. Here we discuss the challenges and opportunities related to the measurements and modelling of groundwater, groundwater recharge, cropping systems and irrigation efficiency, and social and policy reforms for sustainable groundwater management in India. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

These advancements have created unprecedented opportunities for leveraging data-driven insights and informed decision-making. Urban populations swiftly adopt information technology solutions to monitor and regulate noise levels and environmental pollutants effectively. This research aims to bridge the traditional gap between environmental science and economics by harnessing cutting-edge AI and IoT technologies. Support vector machine (SVM) is a robust machine learning algorithm known for its ability to decipher complex, non-linear relationships within large and intricate datasets. This study constructs a robust simultaneous equation model by integrating economic indicators, real-time IoT sensor data, and relevant covariates. Mitigate the health risks associated with air pollution and raise awareness of its detrimental impacts. Air pollution continues to pose challenges to intelligent and sustainable healthcare systems. The healthcare ecosystem, coupled with various machine learning techniques, seeks to mitigate pollution’s impact and enhance residents’ quality of life by offering intelligent services. The analysis of the reciprocal relationship and impact mechanisms between economic development and air pollution is substantiated by empirical data.

The experimental results highlight the efficacy of the proposed SVM, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 84.5%. This performance outstrips alternative methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost algorithms, reaffirming SVM’s prowess in accurately modeling the intricate relationship between economic development and air pollution, particularly when utilizing IoT data. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"The potential for rooftop agriculture in the city of Rio de Janeiro: Growing capacity, Food security and Green infrastructure","The research explores the multifaceted benefits associated with the implementation of urban agriculture on roofs in Rio de Janeiro. The city has challenges in terms of food security, urban sprawl and the fragmentation of the green infrastructure. The study aims to look at rooftop agriculture as a multifunctional solution for addressing these concerns. The methodology consisted of: 1) LIDAR-based mapping and detection of all the roofs with an inclination inferior to 5 degrees on 69% of the surface of Rio de Janeiro City, 2) Analysis of the city structure and the key areas presenting a high flat roof potential, 3) Evaluation of the growing capacity of the flat roofs landscape and the yearly demand of vegetables in Rio de Janeiro City, 4) Visualization of the key locations for rooftop agriculture in the region of Bangu using parametric modelling. The research shows that 1,385 hectares of roofs would be suitable for rooftop agriculture within the study region. This productive roof surface could produce enough food to meet the yearly demand for vegetables of 39.2% of the inhabitants of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The study also demonstrates the great relevance of implementing rooftop agriculture in the poorest communities of Rio de Janeiro in the perspective of tackling food insecurity. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the nexus between Indian forestry and the Sustainable Development Goals,"Forests are considered as a sacred asset in India and have guided the way of living throughout its history. Indian forests not only accommodate the myriad species but also act as a survival support system to the communities that depended on them. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development proposed by the United Nations (UN) has gained momentum and becomes an integral part of the recent efforts of Indian governance. In this investigation, we examined the potential nexus between Indian forestry system (biodiversity-enriched assets, ecosystem services, constitutional mechanisms, and governances) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through theoretical underpinnings from literature that selected from database like Google Scholar, Indian forest survey reports, and information retrieved from Indian government websites. The significance of this review is that it presents comprehensive information about Indian forestry, biodiversity-rich assets, and sustainable forest management practices. The results show that Indian forestry as a whole is an integral part of the food-energy-water cycle and contributes to all dimensions of sustainable development, i.e., economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability. The investigation confirms that besides partly contributing to the economy and life support systems to many dependent species, forests also act as boosters in the areas of food security and health. Targets related to the climate action, peace, and partnership goals are well in place through various forestry interventions and environmental commitments by the Government of India. © 2022 Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency
"Assessing and predicting changes of ecosystem service values in response to land use/land cover dynamics in Ibb City, Yemen: a three-decade analysis and future outlook","Assessing ecosystem services values (ESV) within land use/land cover (LULC) changes is crucial for promoting human well-being and sustainable development of regional ecosystems.

The hybrid land use classification technique for classifying Landsat images, the CA-Markov model for LULC prediction, and the benefit transfer method (BTM) for assessment ESV were employed. Our findings revealed that there was a continuous increase in built-up areas and barren land, with a decrease in cultivated land and grassland, which are predicted to continue for the next 30 years. Consequently, the total ESV has decreased from US$ 68.5 × 106 in 1990 to US$ 65.2 × 106 in 2020 and is expected to further reduce to US$ 61.2 × 106 by 2050, reflecting the impact of urban expansion and socio-economic activities on ESV. The study provides insights for future ESV monitoring, which will contribute to the formulation of effective land-use strategies for more sustainable ecosystem services, particularly in rapidly urbanizing data-limited regions. © 2024 The Author(s).

Land use sustainability on the South-Eastern Amazon agricultural frontier: Recent progress and the challenges ahead,"The recent decoupling of deforestation and soybean production has raised optimistic expectations towards enhanced land use sustainability in the South-Eastern Amazon agricultural frontier. Nonetheless, assessing land use sustainability implies not only the consideration of how agricultural activities affect natural ecosystems but also how they impact on society and how society can cope with them. We review some of the forthcoming challenges that the agricultural sector should address to confirm its significant progress towards land use sustainability. Firstly, we assess the recent efforts to adopt environmentally friendly practices with regard to the ongoing intensification process mainly based on double cropping systems. Secondly, while rapid agricultural development has brought major social advances, we evidence a recent trend towards a decoupling of soy production and the Human Development Index at municipality level. We then put this result into perspective considering that the trend towards agricultural intensification based on the use of large amounts of agrochemicals could lead to major health concerns which are still too rarely considered. Finally, we discuss how the recent efficient policies to contain deforestation in the Amazon can cause indirect land use changes in the Brazilian Cerrados and in African Savannas, thus potentially leading to an “illusion of preservation” at global scale. We conclude that new indicators involving social sciences are necessary to better address the complexity of land use sustainability on the still very dynamic agricultural frontier in the South-Eastern Amazon. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Socially responsible investment in an environmental overlapping generations model,"One of the problems associated with the conservation of the environment is that short-lived individuals fail to account for the long-term effects of pollution, which implies that future generations bear the costs imposed by the current generation. Such inter-generational externalities are usually tackled by (Pigovian) taxes, fiscal policy or environmental regulation. Alternatively, we propose that socially responsible investment funds create a role for the stock market to deal with intergenerational environmental externalities. We analyze the role of the stock market in an environmental overlapping generations model of the Diamond-type, in which agents choose between investing in "" clean"" government bonds or "" polluting"" firm equity. We show that although socially responsible investors are short-lived, the forward-looking nature of stock prices can help to resolve the conflict between current and future generations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Towards green transition of touristic islands through hybrid renewable energy systems. A case study in Tenerife, Canary Islands","The Canary Islands are still largely dependent on expensive imported fossil fuels, are stressed by the increasing touristic impact and are extremely vulnerable to climate change due to water scarcity. Water desalinisation is an energy-demanding process and is essential to the sustainable development of these islands. The aim of this study is to explore the potential advantages of a hybrid installation, exploiting two different renewable energy sources, specifically waves and solar, to supply a large desalination plant in Tenerife. The paper ultimately provides a generally applicable procedure for the design of hybrid installations, including three steps: the assessment of available renewable energy sources, the optimal combination of these sources and finally the economic assessment. The wave and solar resources are assessed first, then the hybrid installation is conceptually designed, proposing a criterion for the optimal mixing of the renewable energy sources that can be applied to other resources and other sites. The basic idea is to maximise the exploitation of the renewable power, minimizing the need of the fossil-based back-up system. The costs of the hybrid installation are finally assessed considering the sensitivity to government incentives, showing that the project parity point is reached within the lifetime of typical desalination plants (i.e. 40 years) and can be significantly more attractive in case of Feed-In-Tariffs available in other European countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Meeting the climate change challenge: local government climate action in British Columbia, Canada","Local governments have a key role to play in implementing climate innovations as they have jurisdiction over a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. Meeting the Climate Change Challenge (MC3) is the first longitudinal study exploring climate innovation in Canadian municipalities. A tri-university research collaborative, it focuses on British Columbia (BC), whose voluntary efforts to set and meet climate change goals were far more ambitious than those offered by the federal government (and almost any other province in North America at the time). These efforts included introducing a carbon tax and the Climate Action Charter voluntary agreement in 2007. Since then, 187 of the 190 local governments in BC have signed the Charter to take action on climate change. Research in the first phase of MC3explored the dynamics of innovative local responses to the coordinated suite of government legislation, complimentary policy instruments, financial incentives and partnerships with quasi-institutional partners. In the second phase, the 11 original case studies were revisited to explore the nature of transformative change in development paths and indicators of change. Methods include sentiment analysis, decomposition analysis of regional/local emissions, and modelling relationships between climate action co-benefits and trade-offs. This paper provides a synthesis of research outcomes and their implications for environmental governance at multiple scales and the potential of policy innovations to accelerate transformation towards carbon neutral economies. Key policy insights Local governments are on the front line of identifying indicators of change in current development paths and policy innovations to effect the necessary changes for transformation to carbon neutral economies. Barriers to transformational change include lack of coordination or concerted action across multiple scales of governance, electoral cycles and large swings in leadership, and lack of policy coherence across governance levels. Drivers of climate innovation include leadership at multiple levels of governance. Understanding the co-benefits (and trade-offs) of climate actions is important for integrated strategies that achieve broader sustainability goals, as well as accelerating more innovations on climate change. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
In Tandem Contact-Transfer Printing for High-Performance Transient Electronics,"High-performance flexible electronics developed with resource efficient printing route will transform the way future electronics is manufactured and used to advance applications such as healthcare, Internet of Things, wearables, consumer electronics, etc. Herein, an innovative approach is presented that involves, for the first time, the in-tandem use of contact and transfer printing methods to realize high-quality electronic layers at selected locations on rigid (Si/SiO2), flexible (polyimide), and biodegradable (magnesium (Mg) foils). Superior grade quality of printed electronic layers is demonstrated by realizing transistors and printed UV photodetectors (PDs) employing high-resolution electrohydrodynamic printing. The all-printed PDs show extremely high performance for UV detection, with extraordinary high responsivity (>107 A W−1) and specific detectivity (≈1017 Jones) values at low UV intensity of 0.1 µW cm−2. Finally, the fabricated PDs on Mg foil are dissolved in deionized water at room temperature. Thus, in-tandem contact and transfer printing has potential for ecofriendly development of transient electronics. Further, the approach allows printing of wide range of nanomaterials and heterostructures or complex superlattice structures, which can open exciting new possibilities for high-performance electronics. © 2022 The Authors.

Hydraulic modeling and prediction of performance for a drinking water supply system towards the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs): A system case study from Uganda,"The world is currently confronted with water scarcity which is associated with deteriorating public sanitation and health, pollution, and ecosystem damage. Maintaining the performance of water supply schemes during a long-term demographic transition would achieve sustainability. This study employs a hydraulic modeling tool to predict the future performance of a water supply system, Najjembe Town water supply scheme, Uganda. Results showed that the flow velocity in the network ranges from 0.01 to 2.36 m/s. The pipeline velocities in the network are generally low under the predicated scenario, and pipes never run full. Flow velocities in some areas are below the recommended minimum velocity (0.6 m/s). The negative pressures were observed in some areas of the network due to high nodal water demand. The proposed hydraulic infrastructural changes improved the global technical performance indexes for pressure (TPIP) and velocity (TPIV) to 89.9–99.3% and 80.9–99.5%, respectively. The implementation of the water supply management plan complied with several sustainable development goals (SDGs) interlinked to targets regarding the provision of clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), supporting agricultural practices to achieve zero hunger (SDG 2), promoting good human health and well-being (SDG 3), promoting gender equality (SDG 5), and economic growth (SDG 8). Defining the linkage between water supply management planning and SDGs would assist in the long-term planning of water infrastructural needs in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner, addressing anomalies in coverage and assisting water supply managers and policy-makers in the sector in making well-informed decisions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustaining Water Resources,"Life depends on water and there are no substitutes. Fundamental to the functioning of the Earth’s system, water is a renewable natural resource that is available in finite amounts. Human appropriation of freshwater resources is mainly used for agriculture. To prevent loss of natural habitat and biodiversity, the growing demand for agricultural products will likely need to be met by enhancing crop yields in currently cultivated land rather than through farmland expansion. Because of local limitations in water availability, irrigation can be sustainably expanded only in part by the currently rain-fed farmland. Any further withdrawal from water bodies would deplete environmental flows or groundwater stocks. Local water deficits (i.e., gaps between availability and demand, including water for food) are often compensated for by food imports from water-rich regions and the associated transfers of “virtual water.” Thus, water is a strategic resource that has become strongly globalized and controlled by a few countries, while the rest of the world is in conditions of trade dependency. Water-saving strategies-based on food waste reduction, moderation of diets, use of more suitable crops, or increased water use efficiency-need to be adopted in order to meet human needs without compromising water sustainability. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
"The man who thought he owned water: On the brink with American farms, cities, and food","The Man Who Thought He Owned Water is author Tershia d’Elgin’s fresh take on the gravest challenge of our time-how to support urbanization without killing ourselves in the process. The gritty story of her family’s experience with water rights on its Colorado farm provides essential background about American farms, food, and water administration in the West in the context of growing cities and climate change. Enchanting and informative, The Man Who Thought He Owned Water is an appeal for urban-rural cooperation over water and resiliency. When her father bought his farm-Big Bend Station-he also bought the ample water rights associated with the land and the South Platte River, confident that he had secured the necessary resources for a successful endeavor. Yet water immediately proved fickle, hard to defend, and sometimes dangerous. Eventually those rights were curtailed without compensation. Through her family’s story, d’Elgin dramatically frames the personal-scale implications of water competition, revealing how water deals, infrastructure, transport, and management create economic growth but also sever human connections to Earth’s most vital resource. She shows how water flows to cities at the expense of American-grown food, as rural land turns to desert, wildlife starves, the environment degrades, and climate change intensifies. Depicting deep love, obsession, and breathtaking landscape, The Man Who Thought He Owned Water is an impassioned call to rebalance our relationship with water. It will be of great interest to anyone seeking to understand the complex forces affecting water resources, food supply, food security, and biodiversity in America. © 2016 by Tershia D’Elgin.",Not About Sufficiency
"COVID-19 and living space challenge. Well-being and public health recommendations for a healthy, safe, and sustainable housing","Background and aim of the work: The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is a strong reminder that the lockdown period has changed the way that people and communities live, work, and interact, and it’s necessary to make resilient the built environment, both outdoor and mainly the indoor spaces: housing, workplaces, public buildings, and entertainment facilities. How can we re-design the concept of Well-being and Public Health in relation to the living places of the future? Methods: According to the previous statements and scenario, this paper aims to integrate the building hygiene and well-being, focusing the possible responses, both existing and for the new buildings, taking home a strong message from this “period” of physical distancing. Results: The Well-being and Public Health recommendations for a healthy, safe, and sustainable housing are framed into the following key points: 1. Visible and accessible green elements and spaces; 2. Flexibility, adaptability, sharing, and crowding of living spaces, and compliant functions located into the buildings; 3. Re-appropriation of the basic principles and archetypes of sustainable architecture, thermal comfort and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ); 4. Water consumption and Wastewater Management; 5. Urban Solid Waste Management; 6. Housing automation and electromagnetic fields; 7. Indoor building and finishing materials. Conclusions: The Well-being and Public Health recommendations for a healthy, safe and sustainable housing may provide a useful basis for Designers, Policy Makers (fostering tax incentives for building renewal), Public Health experts and Local Health Agencies, in promoting actions and policies aimed to transform living places in healthier and Salutogenic spaces.

Technological change and productivity growth for food security: The case of shifting cultivation and the REDD policy,"In many parts of the forest-agriculture frontiers of the tropics, shifting cultivation is practiced as a way of subsistence farming. In particular, widespread poverty and rural population growth are the prevalent causes that aggravate the need for encroaching into the forestland for subsistence farming in these frontiers. In such areas, economic policies and technological change to improve agricultural productivity are vital to avoid the expansion of agriculture by means of shifting cultivation. In particular, as we are in the age of global climate change, resource use and management practices that rely on the use of land clearing and biomass burning, thus emitting carbon into the atmosphere must get our careful attention, despite the need to bring more land under cultivation for enhancing food security. This situation is quite challenging and requires much more careful attention in the case of shifting cultivation practiced in some Asian and African countries. For instance, shifting cultivation by land clearing and biomass burning recycles phosphorous and other nutrients but contributes to deforestation, emission of greenhouse gases, loss of biodiversity, and increased soil erosion and land degradation, etc, and as yet is an important livelihood and food security strategy for millions of smallholders. Because shifting cultivation is so different from the forms of agriculture mostly practiced in the lowlands, and by majority population, it is one of the most misunderstood land use systems. Therefore, in the name of forest conservation and land development, governments in Asia and Africa have devised ad-hoc policies and laws seeking to eradicate shifting cultivation. The reasons usually given for such restrictive state policies are that shifting cultivation is: technologically primitive to improve agricultural productivity; prevents development and thus keeps people trapped in poverty; destructive to forests and soils; and contributing to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by deforestation. However, by adapting appropriate technology and agronomic practices agricultural productivity can be improved in those tropical areas. Such technological changes for more productive and environmentally friendly agriculture, by means of zero tillage/reduced tillage, mulching, integrated plant nutrient management using both organic and mineral fertilizer, improved crop rotations, and improvements in water productivity can not only avoid shifting cultivation, but also contribute to food security, rural livelihood, poverty alleviation, improved soil fertility, and reduced GHG emissions from deforestation. In particular, agricultural productivity can be improved by provision of input subsidies for mineral (inorganic) fertilizers to build on sound ecological principles and agronomic practices; access to finance and micro-credit; improving the infrastructure; capacity development for men and women farmers; and research and development targeting poor rural areas and addressing emerging questions of agro-defence. This chapter therefore discusses the opportunities for technological change in agriculture by rethinking the Agricultural Input Subsidy Programs (as economic-policy reforms) in Asian and African countries, as well as the new financial incentives arising from REDD (as Payments for Environmental Services from UN-REDD program) for those countries for a land use transition towards more intensified agriculture. It is argued that unlocking the potential of ecosystem markets can provide new income to the farmers for the services they provide anyway, while safeguarding the resource quality and enhancing food security. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

An integrated framework for improving green agricultural production sustainability in human-natural systems,"Water scarcity, land pollution, and global warming are serious challenges and crises facing the development of sustainable or green agriculture and need to be addressed using efficient and environmentally friendly management strategies. This paper proposed an integrated framework appropriate for agricultural green total factor productivity (AGTFP) assessment coupled with microscopic and mesoscopic perspectives under water-energy-food (WEF) nexus, which generated scientific and reasonable strategies for green and low-carbon agriculture from internal core factors and peripheral environmental impacts to improve green agricultural production sustainability. Taking the Lianshui irrigation district (LID) with three sub-areas as the object, internal core factors were explored by partial least squares regression (PLSR) and the external impact path through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results indicated that AGTFP in LID was the smallest (0.818) compared to the three sub-areas and was in a fluctuating state. Meanwhile, AGTFP which was calculated considering undesirable outputs, was closer to tangible productivity. Resource endowments and technical facilities will promote agricultural production, desirable outputs will stimulate green production, and undesirable outputs can inhibit green production. The external influence pathway was shown to be primary environment - > secondary environment - > economic aspects - > social aspects - > AGTFP. The innovative perspectives presented in this study can facilitate preferable decisions and avoid unintended consequences for human-natural systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Social adaptive responses to a harsh and unpredictable environment: insights from a pre-Hispanic andean society,"The scarcity or unpredictability of natural resources is a threat to cooperation within human societies. Exacerbated competition between individuals could affect social cohesion and collective action, generate conflicts over natural resources, and compromise their sustainable use. Yet, our in-depth archaeological study of the arid Andean highlands of Bolivia reveals the sustainable development of a complex agrarian society in a harsh environment marked, moreover, by a prolonged climatic degradation from the 13th to the 15th centuries. The 49 community settlements studied comprised independent family households that managed their own economic resources. A detailed study of the granary and housing structures of 549 of these households provided a strong quantitative data set for an analysis of Gini coefficients for grain storage capacity and housing area. This agro-pastoral society flourished with neither notable inequalities of wealth between villagers nor apparent long-lasting conflicts between villages. By sharing local knowledge, labor, and natural resources, this society succeeded both in limiting power and wealth concentration, and in sustainably producing food surpluses to be exchanged with neighboring populations. These results indicate a high degree of social cohesion and low levels of social and wealth inequality, similar to other well-established horticultural and agricultural societies around the world. We propose a conceptual model of low inequality in agrarian societies subject to extreme or unstable environments, where the sharing of knowledge, resources, and labor are the adaptive social responses to cope with the uncertainty in natural resources. The sustainability of the society is then guaranteed by a balance between collective action and family-based social organization. © 2022 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"(Non-)compliance with Public Finance Laws, Sustainability and Social Responsibility: A Critical Analysis of the Use of Mining Taxation in Canaã dos Carajás (Pará, Brazil)","This research critically analyzed the investments of the Financial Compensation for Exploration of Mineral Resources (CFEM), a Brazilian mining taxation, in Canaã dos Carajás (Pará, Brazil). This municipality is the largest recipient of investments in mining industry, and the national second largest recipient of CFEM. However, there is no transparency in the public finance of the municipality, and its standard of living needs improvements. Survey questionnaires revealed some citizens do not trust on local government’s adequate management of CFEM. Further bibliographic reviews and analysis of secondary data from national censuses and the Annual Municipal Budget Law demonstrated the local government violates national regulations regarding specific mandatory shares and areas of investment of resources from mining taxation. Thus, the CFEM is not sustainably invested. It should diversify local economic production and improve quality education, science and entrepreneurship in the municipality, so its inhabitants may enjoy good quality of life even after the end of mining exploration. This research highlights the importance of sustainability in public finance, and the need of strengthening compliance with public finance laws at the municipality level to promote economic and social sustainability in localities that depend upon the exploration of finite natural resources. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Not About Sufficiency
Privatised Keynesianism: An unacknowledged policy regime,"There have now been two successive policy regimes since the Second World War that have temporarily succeeded in reconciling the uncertainties and instabilities of a capitalist economy with democracy's need for stability for people's lives and capitalism's own need for confident mass consumers. The first of these was the system of public demand management generally known as Keynesianism. The second was not, as has often been thought, a neo-liberal turn to pure markets, but a system of markets alongside extensive housing and other debt among low- and medium-income people linked to unregulated derivatives markets. It was a form of privatised Keynesianism. This combination reconciled capitalism's problem, but in a way that eventually proved unsustainable. After its collapse there is debate over what will succeed it. Most likely is an attempt to re-create it on a basis of corporate social responsibility. © 2009 The Author.

‘Beyond GDP’ in cities: Assessing alternative approaches to urban economic development,"Crises spur reflection and re-evaluation of what matters and what is valued. The impacts of the 2008 global financial crisis, COVID-19 pandemic and climate emergency are reigniting debates about the nature of economic development approaches and what they aim to achieve in urban settings. Addressing a substantive gap in contemporary debates by helping to navigate a burgeoning and diverse field, this paper provides a critical and comparative assessment of five leading agendas that have been positioned as alternative and progressive policy responses to urban economic change: inclusive growth; the wellbeing economy; community wealth building; doughnut economics; and the foundational economy. Taking an international perspective, the paper provides a comparative review of their stated visions, mechanisms for change, and the spatial scales through which they are led and implemented. Our argument is that these alternative approaches to urban economic development are shaping creative, innovative and progressive responses to longstanding urban problems within policy and practice communities but require on-going scrutiny and evaluation to realise their potential to meaningfully achieve transformative change. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Plant breeding for organic agriculture: Something new?,"The role of both organic (OF) and conventional (CF) farming remains open to debate particularly when related to food security and climate change. Targeting plant breeding for OF can contribute to reduce its yield gaps vis-à-vis CF. Currently, the cultivars produced for CF are also used in OF, however, it is unreasonable that all lines bred for CF will always perform well in OF. Nonetheless, plant breeding goals for OF and CF converge at aiming for high productivity, host plant resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic factors, and high resource-use efficiency. Likewise end-use quality and local adaptation may be more important for OF as the resource recycling and quality of the inputs that are used vary from region to region, even though OF practices are highly regulated. This article provides an overview on organic plant breeding (OPB) with a perspective from conventional plant breeding, highlights the main traits, their source of variation, and what methods and tools are available for their breeding.

Making homes healthy: International code council processes and patterns,"Context: Americans spend more than 90% of their time indoors, so it is important that homes are healthy environments. Yet many homes contribute to preventable illnesses via poor air quality, pests, safety hazards, and others. Efforts have been made to promote healthy housing through code changes, but results have been mixed. In support of such efforts, we analyzed International Code Council's (ICC) building code change process to uncover patterns of content and context that may contribute to successful adoptions of model codes. Objective: Discover patterns of facilitators and barriers to code amendments proposals. Design: Mixed methods study of ICC records of past code change proposals. N = 2660. Setting: N/A. Participants: N/A. Main Outcome Measure(s): There were 4 possible outcomes for each code proposal studied: accepted as submitted, accepted as modified, accepted as modified by public comment, and denied. Results: We found numerous correlates for final adoption of model codes proposed to the ICC. The number of proponents listed on a proposal was inversely correlated with success. Organizations that submitted more than 15 proposals had a higher chance of success than those that submitted fewer than 15. Proposals submitted by federal agencies correlated with a higher chance of success. Public comments in favor of a proposal correlated with an increased chance of success, while negative public comment had an even stronger negative correlation. Conclusions: To increase the chance of success, public health officials should submit their code changes through internal ICC committees or a federal agency, limit the number of cosponsors of the proposal, work with (or become) an active proposal submitter, and encourage public comment in favor of passage through their broader coalition. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Sustaining adequate public water supply: The challenges ahead,"Public water supply is an essential service traditionally given a high priority in the United States, but sustaining adequate supply will confront a variety of future challenges. All the traditional challenges remain and continue to intensify, including the difficulties of balancing supply and demand in an environment of increasing water scarcity; protecting water supplies from an ever-expanding range of potential contaminants and activities; and maintaining adequate managerial capacity for necessary planning, investing in required facilities, and conducting operations. The challenges of the future will also include non-traditional concerns such as the threat of terrorism directed toward water supplies and climate change that may adversely impact existing supplies as well as make development of new supplies more difficult in some locations. The expanded challenge list also includes more restrictive policy within the institutional framework that controls water use. The historical view that abundant and low-cost water supply had superior status relative to competing water uses has been replaced by one where efforts to expand water supply are viewed more critically. This development has resulted from a rise in environmental values and the associated changes in water management priorities. Sustaining adequate public water supply continues to be an important component of public policy, but the new and intensified challenges confronting water supply managers create a substantially altered environment for future decision making. © 2008 ASCE.",Not About Sufficiency
The effect of environmental variations on the production of the principal agricultural products in Colombia,"The agricultural sector of Colombia supports the national economy and food security due to the rich lands for cultivation. Although Colombia has a vast hydrological basin, climate change can impact agricultural productivity, generating economic and social adverse effects. For this, we evaluated the impact of some environmental variables on the production of the most sold crops using production, climatic, and hydrological data of the 1121 municipalities from 2007 to 2020. We modeled the production of coffee, rice, palm oil, sugarcane, and corn, adopting a Bayesian spatio-temporal model that involved a set of environmental variables: average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, evapotranspiration, precipitation, runoff, soil moisture, vapor pressure, radiation, and wind speed. We found that increases in the average temperatures can affect coffee (-0.2% per °C), rice (-3.76% per °C), and sugarcane (-0.19% per °C) production, meanwhile, these increases can boost palm oil (+2.55% per °C) and corn (+1.28% per °C) production in Colombia. This statement implies that the agricultural sector needs to substitute land use, promoting the production of palm oil and corn. Although our results did not find a significant effect of hydrological variables in any crop, suggesting that the abundance of water in Colombia might balance the impact of these variables. The increases in vapor pressure impact all the crops negatively (between -11.2% to -0.43% per kPa), except rice, evidencing that dry air conditions affect agricultural production. Colombia must manage the production location of the traditional products and implement agro-industrial technologies to avoid the climate change impact on crops. Copyright: © 2024 Cortés-Cataño et al.

The Importance of Adopting and Mainstreaming Climate-Smart Diets for Sustained Resilience,"As global freshwater resources are increasingly threatened, the agricultural sector faces the challenge of feeding a growing human population while curbing its use of fresh water. This use can be traced across international lines by calculating the water cost of globally traded commodities. This trade in virtual, or indirect, water may benefit some countries while allowing others to compensate for dwindling water availability. However, it may not successfully address the need to curb global demand for fresh water. A change in global dietary patterns, reflected in more climate-friendly dietary choices featuring lowered consumption of water-intensive products, is a vital component of a concerted effort to reduce water use and increase our collective resilience to both water scarcity and climate change.

"The role of ecosystem services in the doughnut economy – The example of whale ecosystem services in Disko Bay, Greenland","The doughnut economy framework has been increasingly advocated by academics, governance institutions and policy-makers as a tool for delivering economies that provide a social foundation for all people, are safe and socially just, and respect planetary boundaries. Thus far, the role of ecosystem services (ES) in contributing to the doughnut economy's ambitions has been underexplored. This is surprising considering the wealth of ES literature addressing the theoretical components of ‘a good life’ and relationships between social-ecological systems (SES), resource use and human well-being. Two contributions to the literature are made by this study: (1) a generalised model is outlined linking natural capital to ES to the ecological ceilings and human needs of the doughnut economy's framework, and (2) an illustrative case study of whale ES in Disko Bay, Greenland is provided to demonstrate linkages between ES and the doughnut economy's framework. The findings are based on 19 interviews with representative stakeholders in August 2019 and observational data gathered by the researchers. Although the case study is a simplification of the complexity of SES, it nevertheless reveals several of the key contributions made by whale ES to a mixed economy, especially reduced pressures on the ecological ceilings linked to biodiversity loss and climate change, and a positive contribution to the human needs of food, health, income and work, and social equity. The case study stimulates a discussion that reflects on the limited recognition of the role of cultural ES in the doughnut economy's conceptualisation, evidence of social-ecological trade-offs and complexities. These include some increased pressures caused by whale ES on ecological ceilings and tensions between the human needs, and multi-level governance challenges in operationalising the doughnut economy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Reflections on the ecosystem services of whales and valuing their contribution to human well-being,"Although whale ecosystem services have been scarcely explored in the academic literature, they illustrate many of the threats, trade-offs and decision-making dilemmas common to marine ecosystem services in general – climate change impacts, the ongoing need to provide remote communities with forms of sustenance, and the potential development of new economic sectors which are prosperous but undermine traditional ways of life. In this paper, the first evaluation is carried out of the ecosystem services specific to whales, involving (a) their classification using the established Common International Classification Ecosystem Services (CICES) framework, (b) an assessment of the most suitable methods for their valuation, and (c) implications for decision-making. Our findings are that whale ecosystem services belong to all three categories of the CICES classification and cultural services are the most common type. The most suitable approach for the respective valuation of each service depends on the local socio-cultural context, a fundamental ingredient in value formation, which can formulate on either an individual or collective basis. In the case of individual value formation, this paper recommends the use of economic information derived from non-market valuation techniques; for collective, non-monetary techniques are advised. Given the complexity of human-environment interactions, a pluralist approach to valuation is likely to be required, whereby decision-makers are informed about impacts to whale ecosystem services through a mixture of economic and non-monetary information. A logical consequence of value pluralism is the need for decision-support platforms which can satisfactorily integrate different types of information concerning ecosystem service impacts, evaluating these against multiple marine management objectives. The paper briefly reflects on the potential of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to fulfil this ambition, before discussing some of the current challenges and barriers which have limited the uptake of ecosystem services research in marine planning and decision-making. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Continuing population increase resulting in global decline in cultivable land. Dr. Vo-Tong Xuan on a sustainable path to food security.,"The law of supply and demand which governs market-based economic systems plays a major role in agricultural production, with major effects upon local producers. With total world population size projected to reach approximately 8 billion by 2025, global food production must increase by 2% annually. Food production in developing countries must increase by 3% annually. Continuing population increase will also result in a global decline in available cultivable land per capita. In this context, it is recommended to promote food reserves at the household, national, and regional levels to secure stocks of food grains; to secure land users' rights as an incentive for farmer-tenants; and to develop modern approaches to land use based upon comprehensive and participatory measures. Efforts must be made to expand agricultural extension efforts as well as access to credit from lenders. Governments should implement a form of distribution, such as food rationing, and guarantee the prices of agricultural products. Finally, special attention should be paid to international free trade regimes in order to ensure that subsidized farmers from developed countries have no unfair advantage over their counterparts in developing countries.",Not About Sufficiency
Heritage Component of Sustainable Development,"Due to the abundance of heritage issues interpretation and in order to facilitate analysis of the transformation of an object or site—through expertise and instrumentation—into a topic open to long-lasting cultural consumption, researchers have recently imposed the concept of patrimonialization. Being able to promote and manage sustainable development by capitalizing both natural segments, as well as the cultural and intangible segments of universal heritage, patrimonialization added—from an interdisciplinary perspective—to social interrogations of heritage interpretation, those specific for the necessity to ensure environmental, economic, and social sustainability. This paper will emphasize the importance of heritage component for sustainable development, as well as the fact that patrimonialization provides to sustainable development the opportunity to become part of the heritage. Following an integrated approach, patrimonialization implies that the implementation of all activities related to heritage will be introduced in the service of sustainable development. Thus, policies, strategies, and measures for conservation, protection, and promotion of heritage should stimulate, on the one hand, civic engagement and critical attitude towards protecting and respecting local and universal heritage values and, on the other hand, transnational cooperation in implementing the most appropriate ways for their integration. Therefore, having the quality of an alternative device for economic recovery, heritage of Southeast Europe must be patrimonialized to ensure sustainable reconciliation between entrepreneurship that reflects emergence of regional markets, and consumption of heritage, between economic development and the limitations of environmental protection and between museological local traditionalism and the expansion of international networks of living heritage interpretation. In the field of climate change, there is a clear opportunity for all sectors linked to sustainability and also for heritage. Many of the initiatives of heritage conservation stated that sustainability strategies and compliance are imposed by respect for the environment and climate change constraints. Despite the fact that identification of heritage items was already resolved by instrumentalization of interpretation process, its placement in the field of sustainable development could be done only by interdisciplinary targeting of correlation elements. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency

How health can make a contribution to peace in Africa: WHO's Global Health for Peace Initiative (GHPI),"INTRODUCTION: Interlinkages between conflict, health and peace are well known. The 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion,1 which enumerates the fundamental conditions and resources needed for health, lists peace as the first on the list of prerequisites for health. There cannot be health without peace. Violence in general, and armed conflicts in particular, have a direct impact on health. Conflicts cause violent deaths not only among combatants, but also among civilians, and lead to physical and mental injuries that will have lasting effects long after the conflict has ended. Conflicts also lead to the disruption of health systems, collapse of essential medical supply chains, and breakdown of social and economic systems, making it difficult to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), one of the main objectives of WHO. It also leads to an exodus of healthcare workers, attacks on healthcare, upsurges in epidemics, increased infant mortality rates, sexual violence, and mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. While there cannot be health without peace, there cannot be peace without health either: lack of access to basic social services, such as healthcare, for specific population groups, often on ethnic or religious grounds, leads to feelings of exclusion, sentiments of unfair treatment by the government and perceptions of unequal treatment vis-à-vis other groups. These inequities lead to grievances, which in turn, often boil over into protests and later violence. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.",Not About Sufficiency

Rice Pests and Diseases Around the World: Literature-Based Assessment with Emphasis on Africa and Asia,"Rice is a vital staple crop for global food security, yet a worldwide comprehensive assessment of pests and diseases remains lacking. This study aims to (1) identify globally reported pests and diseases, (2) analyze their distribution patterns, and (3) assess their impact on rice productivity. A literature-based assessment with an initial pool of 15,969 articles from three online databases (PubMed, WOS, and CAB Abstract) resulted in 871 articles for analysis. The findings highlight a regional focus on Africa and Asia, where rice is predominantly produced. Pest occurrence varies across continents, with Diopsis, Maliarpha, and Chilo being prevalent in Africa, while Nilaparvata, Scirpophaga, Sogatella, and Chilo dominate in Asia. Key pathogens differ across regions, with Pyricularia, Xanthomonas, and Sobemovirus in Africa, while Fusarium and Bipolaris are common in Asia. Major yield losses are attributed to Pyricularia (Blast disease), Bipolaris (Brown Spot), Fusarium (Bakanae), and Sobemovirus (Rice Yellow Mottle Virus). The lack of data from major rice producers like Myanmar highlights reporting gaps, urging future research. This study enhances the global understanding of rice pest and disease distribution and their impacts on productivity. It could also support early warning systems and assess the effectiveness of control methods in the context of climate change. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Green & Sustainable Luxury: A Strategic Evidence,"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the evident link between sustainability and luxury while explaining and illustrating the green and sustainable strategy of luxury companies. First, the luxury industry, its key figures and players will be presented. Many luxury groups & firms are investing in exploring greener and more sustainable options, especially to answer their customers’ expectations. An overview of what is happening across a number of different luxury product categories will allow understanding this eco-wave. Examples will be given in several luxury sectors: home design, automotive, haute-couture & fashion, hospitality, yachting, jewelry. The global luxury market represents 200 billion Euros (Bain & Company, 2012). Despite the international economic crisis, it is a booming industry with an impressive growth, driven by the new rich of developing nations such as China and India. Moët Hennessy. Louis Vuitton, created in 1987 only, is the indisputable world leader with a revenue of 23.659 million Euros, an exclusive portfolio of 60 esteemed brands, a retail network of 3000 stores and almost 100000 employees, in 2011. Far behind, there are the Richemont Group, with its emblematic Cartier brand, and the luxury pole of PPR Group, so well represented by the Gucci Group. Beside these big players, many luxury houses have key roles in this highly competitive industry. The heavy green and sustainable global trend, which is not so new (Henion & Kinnear, 1976), is also present in the luxury industry. Durability, timeliness, craftsmanship, quality, authenticity, know how, are key words for defining luxury. The link with sustainability is thus obvious. Nevertheless, luxury companies have relatively recently accelerated the implementation of their sustainable strategy. The 2007 WWF report, which mentioned the poor grades of luxury firms in sustainability and social responsibility, has maybe accelerated the movement (Bendell & Kleanthous, 2007). But why is going green such an evidence for luxury companies? First, it is an absolute necessity: companies have limited natural resources to satisfy unlimited wants (Polonsky, 1994). They have to be effective in terms of resource management, which is source of cost saving and profitability. Second, the green luxury consumer is very aware of environmental issues. He is also very demanding and sensitive to the social condition of the extraction and exploitation of resources, meaning to corporate social responsibility. He has the “money power” and is ready to pay premium prices for a more sustainable product. In Asia, in particular, where Taoism and Buddhism represent a long tradition, green consumerism is a powerful movement (Sempels, 2012). It is a global phenomenon. Third, both the governments’ and competition’s pressures are becoming stronger. At last, with new tools of communication, a green and sustainable strategy has a clear impact on brand reputation. Choosing a green and sustainable strategy is then a major decision. The management has to evaluate the importance of the green market in one hand, and its ability to differentiate its green offering on the other hand (Ginsberg, 2004). And the possibilities go from a “quiet” green strategy” to an extreme green strategy. Green and sustainable luxury products or actions are launched every day. Let’s just evoke some examples. In home design, the “Green Luxury Home” costs over 100 million dollars, is equipped with sustainable strategy and technology, is part of an eco-friendly rehabilitation project, uses geothermal heating and other renewable power production strategies, and produce more energy than it consumes. The “Kokopo House” uses rain water filtration for kitchen and bathroom, natural ventilation, solar power generation for low-power on-site LEDs, has a green design, and a luxury living. “Acqua Liana”, uses the latest technologies in sustainability and costs $29,000,000. In the eco-friendly luxury yachting sector, “Soliloquy” is the “super- green super yacht”. There are also many examples of green luxury hotels & resorts. Environmentally Friendly Luxury Cars includes famous products and brands like “Lexus RX 400”, “BMW plug-in hybrid car”, and the “Ferrari Hy-Kers” model. Jaguar Land Rover has also a visible sustainable development policy. In luxury green fashion and accessories, the “Hermes- Petit H collection” is an interesting example. It is a collection of “unidentified poetic objects” made from factory scraps and defective materials. The green & sustainable jewelry sector is very active with key actions and players like the Kimberley Process, Corporacion Oro Verde, the Alliance for Responsible Mining, The Responsible Jewelry Council. In conclusion, luxury & sustainable development is evidence. The power of the luxury consumers is determinant. The eco and social role of luxury companies is huge, and will have an impact on all industries. © 2016, Academy of Marketing Science.",Not About Sufficiency
GEO-ICTs FOR GOOD: A MOOC ON GISCIENCE FOR CLIMATE JUSTICE,"The last two decades have seen the development and diffusion of new technologies that can help in managing geographic information. This has led to a proliferation of grassroots processes for exploring, creating and sharing geographical data as a way for citizens to take part in decision making in different kinds of processes. However, these ongoing processes are facing technological, cognitive and economic barriers. Universities with the use of open-source geospatial information and communication technologies (Geo-ICTs) should be the primary actors in supporting students and citizens in developing their own spatial thinking and abilities in a more effective and engaging way. In this framework, the Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence on Climate Justice (University of Padova) is developing the massive open online course (MOOC) 'GIScience for Climate Justice', here with the use of open-source and freeware Geo-ICTs that will be freely available for all before the end of 2022. By completing the MOOC, students will learn how to increase their knowledge of climate change and climate justice issues autonomously. Practical activities will improve their skills in obtaining and using geodata and information produced by European institutions, which can lead to them producing and sharing their own data and preparing and managing collaborative projects for sustainability and environmental monitoring. In this contribution, the theoretical background and entire methodology for the preparation and dissemination of the MOOC are presented and discussed, with the aim of disseminating and sharing this experience to actors interested in developing similar activities of using Geo-ICTs for good. © Copyright:",Not About Sufficiency
Climate-adaptive design: Building up ladakh’s ice stupas,"This article chronicles the development of a climate-adaptive water management project, called the ice stupa, in Ladakh, a region in northern India. The ice stupa intertwines ambitious goals for environmental management and economic development with social, cultural, and religious values and practices. Early design prototypes appeared to offer a host of social, economic, and environmental benefits to the community of Phyang. Additional contextual considerations and unexpected challenges surfaced later, providing a more nuanced evaluation of the ice stupa as a design strategy. Today, ice stupa adherents aspire to harness a constellation of integrative co-benefits in project prototypes and to demonstrate the broader value of the design to other communities. Beyond simply addressing a discrete environmental adaptation in Ladakh, the ice stupa project highlights the tensions and possibilities in novel design partnerships and the challenge of producing integrated climate adaptive projects. © 2019, University of Wisconsin Press.

BUILDING THE POLICY ECOSYSTEM IN EUROPE FOR CULTIVATION AND USE OF PERENNIAL BIOMASS CROPS,"Perennial biomass crops (PBCs) can potentially contribute to all ten Common Agricultural Policy (2023-27) objectives and up to eleven of the seventeen UN Sustainable Development Goals. This paper discusses interlinked issues that must be considered in the expansion of PBC production: i) available land; ii) yield potential; iii) integration into farming systems; iv) research and development requirements; v) utilisation options; and vi) market systems and the socio-economic environment. The challenge to create development pathways that are acceptable for all actors, relies on measurement, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas emissions reduction in combination with other environmental, economic and social aspects. This paper makes the following policy recommendations to enable greater PBC deployment: 1) incentivise farmers and land managers through specific policy measures, including carbon pricing, to allocate their less productive and less profitable land for uses which deliver demonstrable greenhouse gas reductions; 2) enable greenhouse gas mitigation markets to develop and offer secure contracts for commercial developers of verifiable low carbon bioenergy and bio-products; 3) support innovation in biomass utilisation value chains; and 4) continue long-term, strategic research and development and education for positive environmental, economic and social sustainability impacts. © 2023 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.",Not About Sufficiency
Water footprint assessment of bananas produced by small banana farmers in Peru and Ecuador,"In 2013, Good Stuff International (GSI) carried out a Water Footprint Assessment for the banana importer Agrofair and its foundation TASTE (Technical Assistance for Sustainable Trade and Environment) of banana production by small farmers in Peru and Ecuador, using the methodology of the Water Footprint Network (WFN). The objective was to investigate if the Water Footprint Assessment (WFA) can help define strategies to increase the sustainability of the water consumption of banana production and processing of smallholder banana producers in Peru and Ecuador. The average water footprint was 576 m3 t-1 in Ecuador and 599 m3 t-1 for Peru. This corresponds respectively to 11.0 and 11.4 m3 per standard 18.14 kg banana box. In both samples, approximately 1% of the blue water footprint corresponds to the washing, processing and packaging stage. The blue water footprint was 34 and 94% of the total, respectively for Ecuador and Peru. This shows a strong dependency on irrigation in Peru. The sustainability of the water footprint is questionable in both countries but especially in Peru. Paradoxically, the predominant irrigation practices in Peru imply a waste of water in a context of severe water scarcity. The key water footprint reduction strategy proposed was better and more frequent dosing of irrigation water. This will generate increased water productivity and better quality of banana fruits. The increased water productivity not only decreases the blue water footprint, it also improves the competitiveness and livelihoods of small banana producers and their families in Peru and Ecuador.",Not About Sufficiency
Global life systems: biological dimensions of globalisation,"Humans did not begin as a global species; we had to expand to become one. And we could not have done so without other living organisms becoming global along with us. In this article, I examine the interconnectedness of global systems based on living organisms, or 'global life systems'. Following the work of Henry Hobhouse, the objects of my analysis are human beings, plants and animals domesticated for food, and pathogenic micro-organisms. Because these life systems are highly interconnected and dependent upon one another, they all became (or are becoming) global more or less together. A global perspective helps us understand more clearly how these biological forces mutually reinforce one another, and what their globalisation has meant for the biosphere. Life systems never could have become global without humans as their carrier, but humans never could have become global beyond the Earth's natural (i.e. without technology) carrying capacity of four to six million people as long as they lived by hunting and gathering their food. To grow beyond this biological limit, humans needed the help of domesticated plants and animals. Thus, the globalisation of life systems has been, and continues to be, characterised by the coevolution of humans, plants, animals, and diseases. Humans did not dominate and control the other global life systems; rather, they all adapted to one another as they evolved. Humans were, and still are, one component in a package of interdependent life forms that continue to adapt to one another.",Not About Sufficiency
"Meat, money and messaging: How the environmental and health harms of red and processed meat consumption are framed by the meat industry","Calls to cut consumption of red and processed meat, in order to protect both human and planetary health, are drawing increased attention from policy actors. This poses a potential threat to meat industry profits. It is well evidenced that producers of other harmful commodities (such as fossil fuels or tobacco) respond with a range of tactics to impede policy action when similarly threatened, including framing the issues at stake in a light more favourable to industry interests. In order to investigate how the meat industry in the UK frames discussions about the environmental and health impacts of red and processed meat consumption, thematic content analysis was performed on documents sourced from the websites of 6 organisations representing the UK meat industry. Across the dataset, four main framings were identified; ‘still open for debate’, ‘most people have no need to worry’, ‘keep eating meat to be healthy’ and ‘no need to cut down to be green’. These frames work in conjunction to minimise the perception of harm, whilst also encouraging continued consumption. Messages were constructed using ‘classic’ framing devices employed by other producers of harmful commodities. These findings are of importance as they provide insight into how debates about food policy may be influenced by meat industry framing of the issues at hand. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Smart agriculture through using cost-effective and high-efficiency solar drying,"Background: Challenges must be handled in an integrated manner when addressing food security and climate change. More efficient designs for food production systems, as well as their logistics, are needed in order to increase food production and to reduce emissions intensity. Specifically, any enhancements done on this purpose would contribute to mitigating climate change. Five important dimensions are being considered in smart agriculture: food security, availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability. Scope and approach: Food supply-demand chain can seriously be effected by uncontrolled population growth. Thus, any perspective to solve these uncontrolled conditions can have a positive impact. Especially giving emphasis on reduction of food losses via expoloring various ways of production, or increasing productivity, or ensuring food security are effective ways for solutions. For example, the use of solar drying for agricultural, marine or meat products is very important for preservation, thus minimizing food losses. However, traditional sun drying is a relatively slow process. Also, the product quality worsens due to several factors: microorganism growth, enzymatic reactions, insect infestations. It is known that utilizing solar energy involves several factors that need attention. Thus, a lot of effort is directed toward improving solar energy technology for drying processes. Key findings and conclusion: This study presents a smart agriculture design for drying using low cost and highly-efficient solar selective absorber. The system is based on an air heating flat plate solar absorber. Levelized cost of heat (LCOH) for the prototype using solar renewable energy is calculated and compared with the fossil fuel energy sources; natural gas, electricity, and liquified petroleum gas (LPG). In addition; a comparison of the costs for air collectors using various selective absorbers; unglazed or glazed, is presented. It is shown that solar energy, in the long run, will be more advantageous compared to fossil fuels. © 2020",Not About Sufficiency
"A review of ecosystem service studies: Concept, approach and future work in korea","In South Korea, the conflict between development and conservation policy still exist among government ministries, and conventional development plan often has priority over conservation policy. Establishment of sustainable development and comprehensive management policy employing the results of ecosystem service studies are highly warranted, but researchers in South Korea are still limited and often misuse the concept of ecosystem services. Thus, we aimed to introduce the concept of Ecosystem Service (ES) and related terminologies such as Social-Ecological Systems (SESs), ecosystem function, trade-off, and human well-being in this paper. Additionally, this article reviewed and arranged key approaches in ES studies as follows: 1) field works, 2) mapping ecosystem services, 3) valuing ES, 4) quantifying trade-offs between ES and 5) understanding SESs. Based on those results, we suggest that field works for basic information have the first priority to be conducted among ES studies. Once basic information is sufficiently accumulated, researchers can perform applied ES research with accuracy. Finally, results of ES studies conducted by five approaches allow decision makers to consider both natural system and society simultaneously, and hence the results can be utilized for sustainable development and conservation policy based on ecosystem-based management.",Not About Sufficiency
"Impact of unprecedented drought in intensive subsistence agriculture and food security: issues, policy practice gap and the way forward","Drought is caused by imbalances in the hydrological cycle's variables, especially lack of rainfall, which is frequently brought on by climate change and can occur anywhere on the Earth. This study aims to conduct a detailed seasonal drought analysis through the seasonal precipitation statistics, groundwater level, and soil moisture in Bankura District during 1991–2022. The study utilized the standardized precipitation index, Standardized water-level Index, and Standardized soil moisture index to assess the meteorological drought, hydrological drought, and agricultural drought at multiple time scales. The three drought indices have been calculated by the ‘Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index’ package using ‘R’ programming, which make it possible to compare the drought situations in various climatic zones. The three months standardized precipitation index was used in the seasonal analysis of different types of drought. The modified Mann–Kendall trend analysis was used to acquire information on the course of the drought and rains. Correlation analysis was also done to evaluate the dependency of agricultural drought upon the meteorological drought and hydrological drought. Seasonal droughts in meteorological drought, hydrological drought, and agricultural drought have been compared to the production of the four major seasonal crops. The trend of rainfall showed -0.184, -1.149, -1.263 and -3.598 mm decreases in pre-monsoon, winter, post-monsoon and monsoon season respectively. The occurrence of drought with negative standardized precipitation index, standardized water-level index, and standardized soil moisture index values frequently depicted dry events in the study area. The results show that the drought harms the productivity of food grains, with production losses of 122.77 thousand tonnes and yield rate losses of 292.37 kg per hectare from the average, respectively. This study also considered non-structural and structural efforts from the governmental, stakeholder, and research communities to mitigate the seasonal drought, frame drought-resilient agriculture, and promote sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
The partnership network scopes of social enterprises and their social value creation,"Social enterprises provide balance between social service-related and profit-making activities. They can be financially sustainable in markets and provide social services that are not provided in the market or by government. In the Korean context, social enterprises also provide jobs and increase employment rates in times of slow economic growth and social inequality. This study investigates the position of social enterprises in the local institutional environment, the partnerships between institutions involved in social enterprises, and the effect of these enterprises on society. This study considers partnerships between organizations as key resources for successful implementation of social enterprises from the resource-based view. Because different scope of partnership network make different contributions to social enterprises, partnership network horizontal scope were identified as partnership with government, for-profit organizations, non-profit organizations and partnership network vertical scope were identified as financial support, managerial support, and marketing support. The Ministry of Employment and Labour has certified social enterprises in Korea since 2010. In this study, a survey of 565 certified social enterprises was conducted. Data for about 70 of these 565 social enterprises were used in hierarchical regression analyses. The results of the analysis showed a positive association between partnerships with government and non-profit organizations and the social performance of social enterprises. However, a negative association was found between partnerships with for-profit organizations and the social performance of social enterprises. The partnerships for marketing support were positively associated with the social performance of firms engaging in social enterprises, but financial support was negatively associated with social performance. Results for managerial support were not significant. Finally, a negative association was found between the period of social enterprise certification and social performance, and entrepreneur capability influenced social performance positively. © 2018, Allied Business Academies.

Evaluating the economic and environmental benefits of rice-soybean diversification in South Korea,"CONTEXT: Climate change, food security concerns, and the need for environmental sustainability pose significant challenges to agricultural systems worldwide. South Korea's heavy reliance on rice monoculture underscores its vulnerability to these challenges, necessitating exploration of crop diversification as a potential solution. OBJECTIVES: This study assesses the vulnerability of the current rice production system to climate-driven yield changes and evaluates the economic and environmental impacts of transition to soybean cultivation as an alternative. METHODS: This study employs a regional integrated assessment approach to predict the adoption rates of soybean cultivation. By combining site-specific yield estimates, farm-level economic data, and economic modeling, the research assesses potential outcomes focusing on farm income, domestic supply, and greenhouse gas emissions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results show that soybean adoption offers economic benefits and emission reductions, particularly for larger farms. However, small farms face greater climate risks, necessitating targeted policy support. Despite soybean's economic potential under current climate and economic conditions, its adoption remains limited. This suggests that factors beyond profitability influence farmers' crop choices. SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the need for region-specific policies that not only incentivize soybean adoption but also address the broader socioeconomic barriers hindering crop diversification efforts, ultimately enhancing climate resilience, food security, and emission reductions. © 2024",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of income inequality on carbon-intensive extractivism,"In recent decades, lower emissions have been driven by structural changes such as the shift from manufacturing to the service sector and investment in energy efficiency. However, many developing countries extract fossil fuels from the Earth’s surface, to export raw materials such as coal, oil, and natural gas in the global market. “Extractivism” is a mode of economic growth currently practiced by many developing countries. This way of economic growth can influence the income distribution and composition of activities that contribute to environmental degradation. Therefore, rent-seeking on fossil fuel export can lead to income inequality and a carbon-intensive economy. The relationship between carbon intensity and fossil fuel rent, which is the main concern of this paper, was first studied by Friedrichs and Inderwildi (2013) using the concept of the carbon curse. This paper follows similar model to carbon curse theory; however, it presents a new approach by examining the augmented the carbon curse theory through the lens of income inequality. Accordingly, this paper examines how extractivism affects the relationship between income distribution and carbon intensity for 137 countries from 1990 to 2014. Our findings show that countries that are highly dependent on oil rents have a higher degree of unequal income distribution and carbon-intensive developmental pathways. Additionally, there exists a unidirectional causality relationship among oil rents, income inequality, and carbon intensity. Finally, the short-run effect of oil fuel rents on income inequality typically continues in the long run but the effects changes for carbon intensity. © 2023 The Author(s).

Improving Climate Change Resilience in Global South Cities Through South-South Climate Finance,"Climate change is likely to exacerbate inequality and poverty in Global South cities despite the presence of international agreements and conventions to enhance sustainable development such as the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Moreover, replicating Global North development models in the Global South might not be sufficient to address the climate change and development aspirations in the context of Asia; hence, Global North innovation capabilities might not be sufficient to address Global South climate change challenges. This paper provides an inductive analysis of the innovations and policies that could facilitate improved climate change mitigation and adaptation in the context of developing Asian cities. The paper concludes that innovative climate change policies should utilise emerging climate finance mechanisms such as South-South climate finance modalities to promote community science/citizen science and social innovation rather than building hard infrastructure as this could improve the governance and distribution of resources in cities. © 2022 by IGI Global.

"Towards the achievement of SDG 7 in sub-Saharan Africa: Creating synergies between Power Africa, Sustainable Energy for All and climate finance in-order to achieve universal energy access before 2030","Improved access to energy in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the potential to alleviate poverty, promote industrialisation, facilitate gender equality and reduce the region's vulnerability to climate change. Consequently, the current low rates of electrification in many SSA countries has been identified as the most pressing obstacle to economic growth, more important than access to finance, red tape or corruption. Despite the presence of numerous initiatives for promoting energy access in Africa, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) calling for universal access to energy by 2030, Africa might still not be able to achieve universal energy access by 2030. Through an analysis of case studies, research articles, policy briefs and project reports this paper sought to investigate the policies, strategies and innovations that could help expedite SSA's progress towards universal energy access before 2030. This investigation revealed that an emphasis on rural electrification and linking energy access to agriculture and irrigation development as the case was in Viet Nam, could successfully diversify African economies and mitigate the negative perceptions about Africa's growth prospects and energy sectors that global economic shocks instigate. Additionally, the operations of Power Africa, the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) Initiative and the China South-South Climate Cooperation Fund can either significantly improve the financing and regulatory frameworks for SSA's energy sectors or constrain economic development in SSA by promoting rent-seeking and corruption which culminates into a ‘climate finance curse’. Consequently, these initiatives can only facilitate inclusive growth as envisioned in the SDGs if SSA develops or strengthens institutions to coordinate and harmonise investments and aid from such autonomous diverse sources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
China can feed its people: views from the White Paper on food security in China.,"This article draws upon China's White Paper on Food Security and Grain Production. The White Paper posits that China will be able to supply sufficient grain to feed its growing population and also supplement world grain supplies. Current grain consumption increased from 210 kg per capita in 1949 to 385 kg per capita in 1995. It is expected that population will reach 1.6 billion in 2030 before population begins to decline. It is expected that the per capita grain consumption could increase to 400 kg per capita during 1996-2030. China plans to meet consumption demands by increasing per unit yields on currently available cultivated land by 1% during 1996-2010 and by 0.7% during 2011-2030. These yield increases are considered small compared to the unit increases of 3.1% over the past 46 years. China plans on meeting consumption needs also by relying more on new developments in science and technology. Currently only 35% of agricultural productivity is due to science and technology. China also plans to protect cultivated land and turn 35 million hectares of wasteland into arable land. The government plans to reclaim over 300,000 hectares annually in order to compensate for reductions in arable land. Arable land is reduced by incursions from urban populations. 660,000 hectares of arable land are lost annually to urban growth, or 0.2% annually. The government must contend with the lack of incentives among farmers to produce grain, when other crops are more profitable and local governments are insufficiently funding the grain sector. China must address problems of water conservation and inadequate infrastructure. China agreed to expand land contracts for grain production from 15 years to 30 years and to permit land transfers without payment.

However, given the close interconnections between climate change, inequality, energy transition and the agrifood sector, this article argues that the conceptualisation of just energy transition should be extended to “just energy-agrifood transition”, such that not only principles pertaining to energy justice but also to agrarian justice are considered in a comprehensive manner. From a political ecology and critical political economy perspective, and by drawing on examples from Southeast Asia, the article additionally proposes broad policy guidelines to help advance just energy-agrifood transition. This includes the promotion of universal access to energy and food, technical solutions embedded with progressive socio-economic goals, measures to address negative socio-environmental consequences of food-energy transitions, more egalitarian distribution of green jobs and productive resources, and ground-up approaches to socio-ecologically sustainable agrifood systems. © 2025 University of Kent.",Not About Sufficiency
Agriculture innovation: the important effects of certification and technology innovation,"Purpose: This study aims to find how trade development and digitalization affect smart-green production. Four factors are investigated in these effects (certification, technology innovation, natural resource management, low pesticides). Design/methodology/approach: The mix-method approach was employed from validating the measurement scale to test the proposed hypotheses. At first, the grounded theory is the most authoritative and standard research method in qualitative research. Secondly, quantitative analysis was employed to draw conclusions about the impact of digitalization and trade development on smart-green agricultural production. Findings: The results found that digitalization and trade development impact the development of smart-green agricultural production through certification employment, technology innovation, and a decrease in pesticide usage. Moreover, digitalization and trade development also indirectly affect the development of intelligent green agricultural production. Meanwhile, digitalization has a higher impact than trade development. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on the premise that digitalization and trade development can drive smart green agricultural production. Still, some studies have found a deviation between trade development and environmental protection. Hence, future research can explore the incentive effect of trade development and digitalization on other industries. Second, the measurement of the dependent variables in this study is based on the premise that smart-green agricultural production has not been widely promoted, so the changes in production before and after the whole public participation in smart-green output have yet to be reflected. Originality/value: Smart green production in agriculture is essential for a transition economy and the world to meet food security and protect the environment. However, the effects of certification, technology innovation, natural resource management, and low pesticides on smart-green agriculture production have yet to be identified. Insights from this study can help governments, policy-makers, and farmers in emerging economies by adapting their strategies within their local contexts. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Food security strategies in the context of environmental and economic fluctuations in Ukraine,"▶ Abstract. The study aimed to assess the impact of investments in agricultural technology on the productivity, economic efficiency and profitability of farming enterprises. The emphasis was on analysing yields of the three leading agricultural holdings in Ukraine: Svarog West Group, Stepova and Agroproduct LLC, which operate in different natural and climatic conditions. The methodology involved collecting data for three agricultural seasons (2021-2023), which was used to identify long-term trends and determine the impact of technology investments on key performance indicators of enterprises. A correlation analysis with the calculation of Pearson's coefficients was used to assess the relationship between agricultural technology expenditures and yields. The economic efficiency was calculated based on profitability and resource efficiency, which compared the results between agricultural holdings and identified management features in different conditions. The main results showed that investments in agricultural technology have a positive impact on yields, although their effectiveness depends on the specialisation of the farms and environmental conditions. For Svarog West Group, a strong correlation between investment and yield was determined (r = 0.85), which highlights the importance of technological innovation. Agroproduct LLC demonstrated the highest level of profitability (40%), which indicates effective cost management. In turn, Stepova achieved the highest efficiency of resource use (0.0056 t/thousand UAH) due to its specialisation in seed production. The results showed that it is necessary to combine technological innovation with adaptation to climate conditions to ensure the long-term efficiency of agricultural production. These findings can be useful for researchers, managers and practitioners involved in agricultural sector development and seeking ways to achieve food security in a changing climate. © The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Comparison of the Revised Air Quality Index with the PSI and AQI indices,"Air pollution indices are commonly used to indicate the level of severity of air pollution to the public. The Pollution Standards Index (PSI) was initially established in response to a dramatic increase in the number of people suffering respiratory irritation due to the deteriorating air quality. The PSI was subsequently revised and implemented by the USEPA in 1999, and became known as the Air Quality Index (AQI) that includes data relating to particle suspension, PM2.5, and a selective options of either 8-hour or 1-hour ozone concentration during increased O3 periods. Yet, the costs of launching a network of PM2.5 monitoring stations are prohibitively high for many countries to implement the AQI from the PSI system in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to discuss the optimal method of assessing air quality using the latest developed Revised AQI (RAQI), a system that serves as an alternative to the PSI and AQI systems. The feasibility, effectiveness, and the differences between RAQI, AQI, and PSI in their applications to several air pollution conditions are also studied in this research. The results show that southern Taiwan's suspended particulates have significantly greater impact on PM2.5/PM10 ratios than in central and northern metropolitan areas, and that the ratios are higher in Taiwan as a whole compared to many other countries. We also found that the RAQI shows more significant results compared to the PSI and AQI as it has a wider coverage of the range of pollutant concentration levels. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Mapping water consumption patterns: temporal analysis of China's food sector at the city level,"The scarcity of water poses a significant challenge to China's sustainable economic and social progress. Despite its pivotal role, the impact of the food industry's final demand on water consumption across regions and sectors through supply chains has been largely overlooked, particularly at the city level. This study establishes an environmentally extended multiregional input–output model to assess the water consumption of the food sector in 313 Chinese cities across 2012, 2015, and 2017. Our findings reveal a distinct distribution pattern of the food sector's water consumption, characterized by higher levels in the east and lower levels in the west, with developed cities generally exhibiting higher consumption. Notably, we observe that the food sector's virtual water predominantly flows to neighboring and developed cities, with the agricultural and wholesale and retail sectors being the primary beneficiaries of final demand. We also pinpoint hotspots and offer policy recommendations aimed at fostering the sustainable development of water resources at both the sectoral and city levels. These findings contribute to understanding the water scarcity driven by the food sector at the city level. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Natural Resource Protection: A Path to Human Development in Africa,"Achieving sustainable development requires balancing economic growth with environmental conservation. This study analyses the impact of natural resource protection on human development in 37 African countries from 2006 to 2021. Using advanced econometric methods—Driscoll-Kraay standard errors, IV-GMM, and panel quantile regression—we find a strong positive relationship between enhanced natural resource protection and improved human development outcomes. This effect is particularly evident in key dimensions such as education (human capital) and health (life expectancy and infant mortality). Asymmetric analysis confirms the robustness of these results across all quantiles of the human development distribution, indicating benefits for diverse socioeconomic groups. However, sub-regional analysis reveals significant heterogeneity, emphasizing the need for context-specific policies. These findings underscore that investments in natural resource protection not only promote environmental sustainability but also drive human development in Africa. To maximize these benefits, targeted policies that promote sustainable resource management, tailored to regional contexts and inclusive of community participation, are essential for ensuring equitable progress across the continent. © 2025 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Increasing exposure of global croplands productivity to growing season heatwaves under climate warming,"Growing season heatwaves that occur simultaneously over global croplands can negatively impact global food baskets. The long-term changes of growing season heatwaves, as well as their impacts on croplands productivity, are crucial to food security, but remain unclear. Here, we investigated changes in the frequency, intensity and magnitude of growing season heatwaves from the past to the future over the global croplands, based on observations and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models. We introduced an index, gross primary productivity (GPP) exposure, as a proxy of the overall impact of heatwaves on cropland productivity. The results show that the frequency and intensity of growing season heatwaves have increased since 1950 and will continue throughout the 21st century. The increase of the annual accumulated magnitude of growing season heatwaves in the future is mainly contributed by the increase of heatwave frequency. This leads to a global-scale increase in the GPP exposure to growing season heatwaves, with Asia, North America, and Europe being the most affected. The continued increase in GPP exposure is dominated by increases in heatwaves rather than GPP itself. Under the lower emission scenario SSP1-2.6, the global cropland GPP exposure will reduce by 86.11% and 330.47% relative to that under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, by the end of 21st century. Our results provide crucial insights into potential impacts of heatwaves on cropland productivity and hence food security. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Air Pollution, Public Health Service and Regional Economic Development: Evidence from New York","The rapid development of world industrialization has brought more and more serious environmental problems, especially air pollution. Its impact on human health has become a shared preoccupation of governments and the public worldwide. Numerous studies have shown that air pollution is associated with the appearance of respiratory diseases. Taking New York as an example, this paper selected PM2.5, a common air pollutant, and asthma, a respiratory disease, as the research objects. By using GeoDa software, Moran scatter map, Significance map, and Cluster map were drawn. Air pollution and economic development in areas with high incidences of respiratory diseases were analyzed. The study revealed that regions where respiratory disease rates were higher had higher levels of air pollution, and developed areas had lower rates of respiratory diseases. Based on these findings, countermeasures and suggestions are put forward. To prevent the government from squeezing private capital, all localities should appropriately increase the procurement of basic public services, and appropriately increase the procurement of basic public services. The government should promote the innovation of the basic public services, improve infrastructure construction, and stimulate fair competition among basic public utilities. © 2023 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing the impact of electricity consumption on water resources in the U.S.,"Electricity generation heavily relies on water. Growing electricity demand globally inevitably leads to water availability concerns. This study proposes a means to quantify the indirect water usage embodied in electricity and assesses the holistic impact of water consumption on available water resources. First, the energy water intensity factor (EWIF), which quantifies the amount of water used to produce energy, is updated at the contiguous U.S. balancing authority (BA) level and on an end user basis to account for electricity trades using an input-output model. Further, the scarce water index (SWI), or volume of scarce water embodied per kWh electricity consumed, is proposed to predict electricity consuming facility water stress impact as the water scarcity footprint (WSF). A case study of U.S. data centers is presented to demonstrate the use of these metrics. Results show that WSF is region-dependent, and the burden of regional water scarcity extends beyond region boundaries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
"Spatial patterns of associations among ecosystem services across different spatial scales in metropolitan areas: A case study of Shanghai, China","Understanding the spatial patterns of ecosystem service (ESs) supply and their multiscale associations are prerequisites for optimizing blue-green space planning and sustainable management in metropolitan areas. This study selected Shanghai as a typical metropolitan area in the plain river network region, and five key ESs were mapped. Based on ESs supply efficiency, an ESs cumulative curve method was proposed to identify ESs hot spots. The bivariate local Moran's I was used to compare the trade-offs and synergies among ESs and their spatial distributions across the four grid scales and two administrative division scales. The results showed a strong spatial heterogeneity of ESs supply and a scale dependency of the associations among them. The high-value areas of the ESs supply were mainly distributed in the west, north, and south. The hot spots of each ecosystem service accumulated more than 55% of each service, but only occupied areas less than 30% of the whole area. The synergies of four of ten pairs of ESs remained consistent across all scales. At the grid scales, they were all synergistic. The synergies of nine pairs of ESs decreased as the scale increased, and the other pair showed the opposite trend. At the administrative division scales, almost all pairs exhibited the strongest synergies at the district scale, and six pairs were trade-offs at the subdistrict scale. The scale effects indicated that the district scale was appropriate for decision-making in metropolitan areas, but the subdistrict-scale results should not be directly used as a reference. Finally, hierarchical planning and conservation policies and differentiated management policies at different administrative division scales were proposed. This study contributes to creating win–win options and improving human well-being. The analytical framework can be applied to across regions and to assess the ESs supply under various planning scenarios. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Multi-criteria decision making and fairness evaluation of water ecological carrying capacity for inter-regional green development,"Determining water ecological carrying capacity (WECC) is of great significance to ensure inter-regional green development. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for WECC assessment in the Yangtze River Economic Zone (YREZ), China. Effects of water resources, socio-economic, and ecological elements on WECC can be evaluated based on multi-criteria decision analysis. Gini and unbalance coefficients are used for measuring the regional fairness between WECC and socio-economic development. Surface water production pressure (SWPP) and groundwater pollution risk (GPR) are further regarded as indicators for expressing water resources constraint on shale gas extraction in the YREZ. Results disclose that the average WECC level decreases from 0.439 in 2000 to 0.4007 in 2016, which is the opposite of the changing trend in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. A high WECC level appears in Zhejiang (0.5126) with a good state, but that of Guizhou (0.3983), Anhui (0.3968), Hunan (0.3914), and Chongqing (0.3651) are at the alert state. The obstacle factors of WECC in the eastern YREZ mostly originate from socio-economic and water resource subsystems, while that in the middle and western YREZ mainly arise from water resources and ecological subsystems. Fairness analysis shows a well-matching characteristic between the overall WECC and socio-economic performances due to a majority of their Gini coefficients lower than 0.4, while a poor matching characteristic exists in terms of provincial differences owing to their varied unbalance coefficients, especially in Guizhou, Jiangsu, and Shanghai. Moreover, Chongqing with most of shale gas reserves is characterized by slight SWPP (1.0202) and GPR (0.0188), but the prospect of shale gas development in Sichuan is not optimistic due to its high SWPP (1.0846) and GPR (0.0647). Recycling of flowback and product waters can significantly lighten regional water resources pressure. This presented framework can be applied into many other Chinese cities (e.g., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region) with slight modifications according to their actual situations for supporting water resource managers and government with decision making. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
What lies behind teaching and learning green chemistry to promote sustainability education? A literature review,"In this qualitative study, we aim to identify suitable pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning green chemistry among college students and preservice teachers by examining the teaching methods that have been used to promote green chemistry education (GCE) and how these methods have supported green chemistry learning (GCL). We found 45 articles published in peerreviewed scientific journals since 2000 that specifically described teaching methods for GCE. The content of the articles was analyzed based on the categories of the teaching methods used and the revised version of Bloom’s taxonomy. Among the selected articles, collaborative and interdisciplinary learning, and problem-based learning were utilized in 38 and 35 articles, respectively. These were the most frequently used teaching methods, alongside a general combination of multiple teaching methods and teacher presentations. Developing collaborative and interdisciplinary learning skills, techniques for increasing environmental awareness, problemcentered learning skills, and systems thinking skills featuring the teaching methods were seen to promote GCL in 44, 40, 34, and 29 articles, respectively. The results showed that the integration of green chemistry teaching (GCT), e.g., with sustainable education, promoted GCL by fostering environmental consciousness and behavioral change and cognitive processes in a sustainable direction. © 2020, MDPI AG.

Impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions in G20 countries,"Over the past three decades, the G20 countries have experienced rapid economic growth but also a widening income disparity and deteriorating environment. We examined whether and how income distribution affects CO2 emissions during economic growth under the extended EKC framework. Using simultaneous quantile regression analysis, we show that, for developing countries, a more equal income distribution favors reductions to the CO2 emissions per capita, whereas, in most developed countries, income inequality hardly affects CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, the EKC hypothesis is valid in G20. Based on the empirical results, we particularly emphasize the importance of reducing income inequality in developing countries and that the entire G20 takes the path of sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
"Rice yield development and the shrinking yield gaps in China, 1981–2008","Increasing population, limited land resources, and the demand for environmental protection highlight the urgency of improving crop yield on the limited cultivated land. To identify a possible food supply under a sustainable intensification of agricultural production, it is necessary to accurately estimate yield potentials and yield gaps. Here, we used a well-validated, large-scale process-based crop model, Model to capture the Crop-weather relationship over a Large Area for rice, and an ensemble model simulation method to estimate the yield potential across the rice planting area of China. We further evaluated the spatiotemporal patterns of actual yield, yield potential, and yield gap over the past three decades. Rice yield showed an increasing trend in more than 95% of the studied counties. However, 48.3% of the counties were already experiencing yield stagnation. The yield potential in northeast China had increased over the past three decades by 20–40 kg/ha per year because of the increase in temperature, while the increased temperature and decreased solar radiation reduced the yield potentials in other regions by 10–30 kg/ha per year. Because of changes in the actual yield and yield potential, the yield gap decreased in 93.4% of the counties by an average of 0.5–2% per year, resulting in less room for yield improvement. Additionally, 65.9% of the counties had nearly approached their yield ceilings (>70% of the yield potential). Our study highlights that popularizing advanced management technologies to close yield gaps and breeding climate-resilient cultivars to expand yield potentials should be of equal importance for the sustainable development of agricultural production and food security. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Not About Sufficiency
"Poyang Lake basin: A successful, large-scale integrated basin management model for developing countries","Protection of water environment while developing socio-economy is a challenging task for lake regions of many developing countries. Poyang Lake is the largest fresh water lake in China, with its total drainage area of 160,000 km2. In spite of rapid development of socio-economy in Poyang Lake region in the past several decades, water in Poyang Lake is of good quality and is known as the ""last pot of clear water"" of the Yangtze River Basin in China. In this paper, the reasons of ""last pot of clear water"" of Poyang Lake were analysed to demonstrate how economic development and environmental protection can be coordinated. There are three main reasons for contributing to this coordinated development: 1) the unique geomorphologic features of Poyang Lake and the short water residence time; 2) the matching of the basin physical boundary with the administrative boundary; and 3) the implementation of ""Mountain-River-Lake Program"" (MRL), with the ecosystem concept of ""mountain as source, river as connection flow, and lake as storage"". In addition, a series of actions have been taken to coordinate development, utilisation, management and protection in the Poyang Lake basin. Our key experiences are: considering all basin components when focusing on lake environment protection is a guiding principle; raising the living standard of people through implementation of various eco-economic projects or models in the basin is the most important strategy; preventing soil and water erosion is critical for protecting water sources; and establishing an effective governance mechanism for basin management is essential. This successful, large-scale basin management model can be extended to any basin or lake regions of developing countries where both environmental protection and economic development are needed and coordinated. © IWA Publishing 2011.",Not About Sufficiency
Rapid urbanization in China: A real challenge to soil protection and food security,"To feed its 1.3 billion population with a per capita cultivated land far below the world average, China is already facing a great challenge of land scarcity. Accelerated urbanization along with explosive economic growth has further worsened the shortage of agricultural land over the last two decades. Increasing concern over land is expressed in terms of soil availability for grain production and soil quality degradation. Based on official statistics and data derived from satellite imagery, dynamics of China's cultivated land over the past two decades is outlined and the causes and destinations of cultivated land loss are analyzed in this paper. Particularly, urbanization-related land-use changes and their spatial variation across the country are demonstrated. Furthermore, impacts of urbanization and associated waste disposals, consequent shifts of soil utilization on areal soil quality are expatiated. It is initially concluded that China's cultivated land is shrinking at a rather shocking rate. Although conversion to urban and industrial uses took up a comparatively small share of total cultivated land loss, urbanization should still be considered as a great threat to future agricultural production for several reasons. Urbanization is increasing the risk of soil pollution through waste disposal and acid deposition derived from urban air pollution. Facing rapid urbanization, China is making positive policy responses to the challenge of decreasing availability of cultivated land and offering unremitting efforts towards the goal of national food security. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Fragmentation to integration: Environmental and sustainable development challenges in Malaysia,"The topic of sustainable development drew renewed vigour at the Rio+20 Summit in June 2012 in Rio de Janeiro, two decades after the historic United Nations Summit on Environment and Development in the same Brazilian city in 1992. There were several noteworthy achievements in the 1990s from the relatively swift negotiation to the quick adoption of the UN treaties in areas relating to climate change, biological diversity and bio-safety. The current global economic malaise in developed countries and social inequalities between and within countries has highlighted the failure of living up to the commitment made by many countries towards the paradigm shift towards more sustainable economic models in terms of production and consumption patterns. More worrying, Rio+20 actually witnessed many developed countries retreating from their responsibility of providing the means for developing countries to fulfil the sustainable development agenda. © 2014 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

"Modelling long-term HFC emissions from India's residential air-conditioning sector: exploring implications of alternative refrigerants, best practices, and a sustainable lifestyle within an integrated assessment modelling framework","India's growing role in the global climate debate makes it imperative to analyse emission reduction policies and strategies across a range of GHGs, especially for under-researched non-CO2 gases. Hydrofluorocarbons' (HFCs) usage in cooling equipment and subsequent emissions are expected to increase dramatically in India with the phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) as coolants in air-conditioning equipment. We focus on the residential air-conditioning sector in India and analyse a suite of HFC and alternative coolant gas scenarios for understanding the implications for GHG emissions from this sector within an integrated assessment modelling framework. We find that, if unabated, HFC410A emissions will contribute to 36% of the total global warming impact from the residential air-conditioner sector in India in 2050, irrespective of the future economic growth trajectory, and the remaining 64% is from energy to power residential air-conditioners. A move towards more efficient, low global warming potential (GWP) alternative refrigerants will significantly reduce the cumulative global warming footprint of this sector by 37% during the period 2010–2050, due to gains both from energy efficiency as well as low GWP alternatives. Best practices for reducing direct emissions are important, but only of limited utility, and if a sustainable lifestyle is adopted by consumers with lower floorspace, low GWP refrigerants, and higher building envelope efficiencies, cumulative emissions during 2010–2050 can be reduced by 46% compared to the Reference scenario. Policy relevance Our analysis has important implications for Indian climate policy. We highlight that the Indian government's amendment proposal to the Montreal Protocol is a strong signal to the Indian market that the transition away from high GWP refrigerants towards low/zero GWP alternatives will happen sooner or later. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency should extend building energy conservation code policy to residential buildings immediately, and the government should mandate it. Government authorities should set guidelines and mandate reporting of data related to air-conditioner coolant recharge frequency and recovery of scrapped air-conditioner units. For contentious issues like flammability where there is no consensus within the industry, the government needs to undertake an independent technical assessment that can provide unbiased and reliable information to the market. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Bridging the Gap in Social Infrastructure for the Ageing Population in Bangladesh,"With a 15% growth in the population over 65 years of age in the last decade, it is more important than ever for the government of Bangladesh to design innovative policies around social infrastructure for the ageing population. The primary emphases of national policies are to improve the status of elderly people in Bangladesh and to prioritise their welfare. Overall, the gaps fall across both “hard” social and “soft” social infrastructure. Moreover, resource constraints, weak management of public initiatives, and unplanned urbanisation, coupled with the pandemic have exacerbated the challenges associated with the ageing population. Focusing on the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 9) and analysing the current scenario through the WHO framework of an age-friendly built environment, this chapter uses document analysis to identify areas of current and future community needs and gaps in social infrastructure supply, as well as those which support human well-being with a focus on affordable and equitable access for the ageing population. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Global priorities for climate change and mental health research,"Background: Compared with other health areas, the mental health impacts of climate change have received less research attention. The literature on climate change and mental health is growing rapidly but is characterised by several limitations and research gaps. In a field where the need for designing evidence-based adaptation strategies is urgent, and research gaps are vast, implementing a broad, all-encompassing research agenda will require some strategic focus. Methods: We followed a structured approach to prioritise future climate change and mental health research. We consulted with experts working across mental health and climate change, both within and outside of research and working in high, middle, and low-income countries, to garner consensus about the future research priorities for mental health and climate change. Experts were identified based on whether they had published work on climate change and mental health, worked in governmental and non-governmental organisations on climate change and mental health, and from the professional networks of the authors who have been active in the mental health and climate change space. Results: Twenty-two experts participated from across low- and middle-income countries (n = 4) and high-income countries (n = 18). Our process identified ten key priorities for progressing research on mental health and climate change. Conclusion: While climate change is considered the biggest threat to global mental health in the coming century, tackling this threat could be the most significant opportunity to shape our mental health for centuries to come because of health co-benefits of transitioning to more sustainable ways of living. Research on the impacts of climate change on mental health and mental health-related systems will assist decision-makers to develop robust evidence-based mitigation and adaptation policies and plans with the potential for broad benefits to society and the environment. © 2021 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Recent social trends in Greece, 1960-2000","The newest volume in the Comparative Charting of Social Change series highlights the main elements of demographic, social, political, and economic development in Greece during the period 1960-2000. Based on a systematic analysis of available information and data, this volume provides an overview of Greece's socio-economic profile, which changed significantly during the studied period. The collapse of the dictatorship in 1974 and Greece's entry into the European Union (EU) in 1980 have led to a consolidation of democratic institutions and the improvement of living standards. During the 1960s and 1970s the country experienced high rates of economic development and relatively low unemployment rates. However, this increase in economic development has slowed since the early 1980s and the unemployment rate has risen, particularly among young people. Consistent with recent social trends in other Western societies, Greek society has become more tolerant and permissive, with more diverse and flexible moral norms. However, the prevailing family model remains traditional and the Greek Orthodox Church continues to have a strong influence on many aspects of Greek society, including social, political, and cultural life. The organization of work also follows traditional patterns, despite the introduction of new and flexible forms of employment. Female participation in the labour market remains relatively low, despite legislation and regulations that promote equality of opportunities between the sexes. Consistent with recent social trends in other Western societies, Greece's population is aging and the birth rate has stabilized at a relatively low level. © McGill-Queen's University Press 2004.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment of the impact of China's Sloping Land Conservation Program on regional development in a typical hilly region of the loess plateau—A case study in Guyuan,"China's Loess Plateau is one of the world's most ecologically fragile regions and is suffering severe soil erosion. To reduce land degradation, alleviate poverty and stimulate economic development, China began the Sloping Land Conservation Program (SLCP) in 1999. In this study, we comprehensively assessed the impact of the SLCP on regional development in a typical hilly region of the plateau (Guyuan) by quantifying the ecological impact on land use, the economic impact on value added farm products (VAFP) and household income, and the social impact on the employment structure. We found that a portion of the sloping cultivated land was converted into forest and grassland on all slopes. However, part of the cultivated land on steep slopes is still being used for agricultural activity, and some relatively flat cultivated land was withdrawn from cultivation. The VAFP increased from 1999 to 2013, largely due to agricultural intensification by focusing on certain on-farm production and enhancing intermediate inputs. The SLCP helped to relax the liquidity constraint for off-farm employment and promoted change in the cultivation structure, leading to an overall increase in household income. Tree nurseries have a more positive impact on income and off-farm employment than traditional cultivation in the study area. In general, the SLCP contributes to regional development on all three dimensions. Enhanced governmental supervision and proper guidance is needed to consolidate the present achievement and to stimulate the program. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of Climate Change on Women’s Political Empowerment: The Sustainable Development Perspective,"As the influence of climate change on human sustainable development intensifies, the issue of climate change is attracting the attention of more and more scholars, countries, international organizations. However there are few of empirical studies investigating the relationship and interaction mechanisms between climate change and women’s political empowerment under the background of sustainable development. Here, using a two-way fixed-effects model, and a large balanced panel data of 132 countries from 1995 to 2023, we provide new evidence on the relationship and interaction mechanisms between climate change and women’s political empowerment. We conclude that climate change has a negative impact on women’s political empowerment and income inequality magnifies the effect. Subsample analysis shows the negative impact is particularly pronounced in countries with right-wing parties in power and high levels of economic development. Moreover, government efficiency, political stability and sustainable development ability slows down the impact of climate change on women’s political empowerment and has a positive moderating effect.

The relevance of political ecology perspectives for smallholder Climate-Smart Agriculture: A review,"Climate-smart agriculture has emerged as a way of increasing food productivity, building resiliency to climate change and reducing carbon emissions. Despite rapid technical advances, research on climate-smart agriculture has arguably under-theorized the socio-political processes that continue to marginalize vulnerable groups such as smallholder farmers. This review discusses the potential usefulness of political ecology perspectives for improving climate-smart agriculture. Political ecology theory elucidates how three inter-related socio-political processes that perpetuate smallholder farmer vulnerability significantly influence climate-smart responses: inequality, unequal power relations and social injustice. The article discusses these three inter-connected political ecology factors using a number of examples from the Green Revolution, smallholder farming communities, and indigenous farmers. In comparison to conventional technical approaches, our article argues that Climate-Smart Agriculture needs to consider political ecology perspectives at different levels to explore the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to current and future climate change impacts. Interventions to support climate-smart agriculture should examine local risks, specificities and priorities of smallholder farmers. The article concludes with a renewed call for concepts of inequality, unequal power relations and social injustice to be embedded into both the policy and practice of climate smart agriculture. © 2020, University of Arizona Libraries.",Not About Sufficiency
Efficiency of conservation agriculture production systems for smallholders in rain-fed uplands of India: A transformative approach to food security,"With challenges from global climate change, it is imperative to enhance food production using climate-smart technologies and maximize farm efficiency. Fifty-six households in Rudhiapada and Badamahulidiha, Odisha, India were selected to evaluate farmers' efficiency using conservation agriculture (CA) cropping system practices. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and regression analysis were used to estimate farmer efficiency and the determinants of yield. Conventional tillage with the local maize cultivar was compared to reduced tillage with improved maize cultivar and maize intercropped with cowpea. Badamahulidiha outperformed Rudhiapada in yields for all cropping systems. This could be attributed to lower input use and exposure to NGO training. The current efficiency level of farmers' productivity was between 0.4 and 0.7. Inputs such as labor, seed, and fertilizers were found to be significant in increasing yield except for female labor and phosphate. This finding suggests conservation agriculture cropping system is female friendly. The conservation agriculture cropping systems improved maize yields by 60% to 70% when compared to conventional farming system. Combining conservation agriculture practices with improving efficiency of farmers in optimal use of the inputs can contribute substantially to productivity, thus enhancing food security and nutrition in the face of climate change in India and other tropical areas. © 2017 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
The price is not right,"The 2015 Paris Agreement requires all nations to combat climate change and to adapt to its effects. Countries promise to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through their Nationally Determined Contributions. Pledges to reduce emissions, however, have implications for economic growth. We estimate the link between economic growth and CO2 pollution levels and find that this relationship is highly non-linear. A country's GHG emissions rise rapidly as its economic activity rises, relative to global activity, meaning that fast-growing countries contribute most heavily to current GHG emissions. Then, using real per-capita GDP as our metric, we estimate how much the carbon price should be in order to remove the economic growth benefit from excess GHG emissions. We find that the implied prices are far higher than the prices on any existing market for emissions as well as estimates of the social cost of carbon. Our findings also have important implications for the global dialogue regarding responsibility for climate mitigation as well as for the choice of policies to support mitigation efforts.

Hidden losers? The impact of rural refugees and refugee programs on poorer hosts.,"In rural refugee-affected areas, the better-off and more visible hosts usually gain from the presence of refugees and from refugee programs. In contrast, the poorer among the hosts can be hidden losers. The poorer hosts can lose from competition for food, work, wages, services, and common property resources. Vulnerable hosts also lack refugees' option of sending their weaker dependents to camps and settlements. These effects further strengthen the case for development to benefit the whole population in refugee-affected areas. -from Author",Not About Sufficiency
Urban Water Ecosystems in Africa and Asia: Challenges and Opportunities for Conservation and Restoration,"This book examines urban water ecosystem management and restoration through selected case studies in Asia and Africa. Employing a socioecological approach, this volume presents insights on the interlinkages between water, humans, and environmental conservation in an urban context. Topics include human health risks, population displacement and migration, water pollution, water scarcity, flood management, water infrastructure, afforestation, and the effects of climate change. Case studies are drawn from a variety of countries in Africa and Asia, including China, Japan, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Kenya, Malawi, and Tunisia, which demonstrate a wide range of different challenges, and opportunities. Overall, this book argues that to better manage urban water resources, there needs to be a shift from urban water management to urban water ecosystem management. This shift needs to acknowledge the complex biophysical and socio-political dimensions of water ecosystems. This book will be of great interest to students and scholars of water resource management, ecosystem services, urban studies, environmental conservation and sustainable development. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Shamik Chakraborty, Amit Chatterjee and Pankaj Kumar; individual chapters, the contributors.

Crop switching for water sustainability in India’s food bowl yields co-benefits for food security and farmers’ profits,"Groundwater depletion due to agricultural intensification is a major threat to water and food security in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), a critical food bowl, home to 400 million people and currently producing 135 million metric tonnes of cereals. Among the solutions proposed to address this unsustainable water consumption, crop switching has received growing attention, yet its potential to produce co-benefits or trade-offs for other dimensions of sustainability (for example, food supply and farmers’ profits) remains largely unquantified. In this study, we developed and applied a crop switching optimization model for cereals in the IGP to maximize calorie production and farmers’ profits and minimize water consumption. We found that switching from rice to millets (pearl millet) and sorghum in the Kharif (monsoon) season and from wheat to sorghum in the Rabi (winter) season could potentially reduce water consumption by 32%, improve calorie production by 39% and increase farmers’ profits by 140%. We also found that switching crops offers a larger reduction in groundwater depletion and energy savings than improving irrigation efficiency (that is, from flood to drip irrigation). Our findings demonstrate the potential for crop switching to address the multidimensional sustainability challenges of the IGP, with possible application to other regions facing similar issues. © The Author(s) 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Children's exposure to nitrogen dioxide in Sweden: Investigating environmental injustice in an egalitarian country,"Study objective: Prior studies have shown that children are particularly sensitive to air pollution. This study examined whether children of low socioeconomic status suffered greater exposure to outdoor nitrogen dioxide than more affluent ones, both at their place of residence and at school, in a country with widespread state intervention for social equity. Design: Local scale data on outdoor nitrogen dioxide obtained from a validated air pollution model were analysed, along with all school children accurately geocoded to their building of residence and school. Participants: All 29 133 children in grades one through nine (aged 7 to 15 years) residing and attending school in Malmö, Sweden, in 2001. Main results: Defining the socioeconomic status of children according to the mean income in their residential building, the spatial scan statistic technique allowed the authors to identify eight statistically significant clusters of low socioeconomic status children, all of which were located in the most polluted areas of Malmö. Four clusters of high socioeconomic status children were found, all of them located in the least polluted areas. The neighbourhood socioeconomic status better predicted the nitrogen dioxide exposure of children than the socioeconomic status of their building of residence. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide at the place of residence and school of attendance regularly increased as the socioeconomic status of a child's neighbourhood of residence decreased. Conclusions: Evidence of environmental injustice was found, even in a country noted for its egalitarian welfare state. Enforcement of environmental regulations may be necessary to achieve a higher level of environmental equity.",Not About Sufficiency
The FAO and mountain partnership engagement with mountains,"With its mandate to work on natural resource management; food security; and livelihoods; and its attention to the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has played a leading role in sustainable mountain development for many years. In 1992, the FAO was appointed Task Manager for Chapter 13 of Agenda 21 (Managing Fragile Ecosystems: Sustainable Mountain Development) and acted as the lead agency for the International Year of Mountains in 2002. The FAO hosts the global Secretariat of the Mountain Partnership and, from 2003 onward, has also been mandated by the United Nations General Assembly to lead observance of the International Mountain Day, every year on 11 December. Over time, the FAO has progressively built up a conceptual and operational framework that links sustainable mountain development to forest hydrology and watershed and risk management. This Platform Statement provides an update on the FAO's regular program on sustainable mountain development, watershed management, and forest hydrology, which includes normative work, a strong field program, and support to international processes.

A sustainability framework for assessing trade-offs in ecosystem services,"Achieving sustainability, i.e., meeting the needs of current populations without compromising the needs of future generations, is the major challenge facing global society in the 21st century. Navigating the inherent trade-offs between provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ecosystem services, and doing so in a way that does not compromise natural capital needed to provide services in the future, is critical for sustainable resource management. Here we build upon existing literature, primarily from economics and ecology, to present an analytical framework that integrates (1) the ecological mechanisms that underpin ecosystem services, (2) biophysical trade-offs and inherent limits that constrain management options, (3) preferences and values of stakeholders, and (4) explicit analysis of how systems evolve through time to ensure the goal of meeting the needs of future generations. Well-known ecological models define the relationships and trade-offs among services that represents an ""efficiency frontier."" Well-known methods in economics that combine preferences that define the willingness of stakeholders to trade off ecosystem services on the efficiency frontiers illuminate desirable outcomes that meet human needs. System dynamics show how the system will evolve with consequent impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being and the effects this has on achieving sustainability. Heterogeneity in biophysical constraints, uncertainty, technological advances, and obstacles imposed by societal factors and governance regimes influence potential and realized ecosystem services. Using a set of contrasting scenarios, we illustrate how progress can be made toward sustainability and the important obstacles that must be addressed in doing so. Our framework for analyzing sustainability drawn from economics and ecology is intended to make an integration of concepts from both disciplines accessible to a wider audience. © 2015 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Vulnerability reduction in post-conflict areas through the Resource Nexus approach (Water–Soil-Food-Atmosphere) to sustainable food production systems: a case study in Colombia,"The prolonged armed conflict in Colombia, spanning over the last five decades, has significantly impacted its agricultural areas and led to the widespread displacement and disruption of farming activities. The agricultural sector is crucial for Colombia as it contributes to food security, the economy, and the Nation’s employment rate. However, the agricultural sector is challenged by the environment and its natural resources, especially water in water abstraction and soil in terms of degradation and land cover change. Additionally, climate change exacerbates these challenges by altering precipitation patterns, increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, and further stressing water and soil resources, making sustainable management even more critical. The Resource Nexus approach comes into play to cope with and mitigate such challenges. Combined with social equity to advance the sustainability of agriculture, the Nexus approach demonstrates pathways towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (Zero Hunger)in synergies with other SDGs, like SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequality), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). This paper addresses the dual challenge of improving natural resources management and population vulnerability reduction in the frame of environmental conflicts and population inequalities that severely affect the resilience of food systems. In line with principles of inclusion and gender equity, the methodology developed here aims to identify Colombia's productive regions that would benefit from enhanced management at the landscape level, the Resource Nexus approach. With the use of geographic information systems (GIS), this research spatially evaluates the (i) impact of land-use changes and the land-use fragmentation due to resource overuse, (ii) the provision of ecosystem services under different uses of natural resources and suggests ecosystem services planning as a methodology for municipal ecosystem-based management, (iii) climate change and the anthropogenic impacts on agricultural productivity in Colombia at the municipality scale. The results indicate significant environmental changes over the past few decades, including reduced natural forests and increased agricultural land. This shift has coincided with a decrease in freshwater availability. Additionally, there is a concerning trend of agricultural expansion into protected areas, highlighting the ongoing pressures on natural resources and the need for sustainable management practices. This study underscores the value of the science-policy interface to ensure increased social equity, economic growth, and resource conservation. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
The environmental impact of reducing food loss and waste: A critical assessment,"This paper examines the rationale for pursuing environmental objectives by reducing food loss and waste (FLW). The main thrust of the literature on this issue is that FLW reduction can make a major contribution to making food systems more sustainable. Using a stylized analytical framework, we find that reducing FLW always improves resource use efficiency for land and water, and reduces the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted per unit of food consumed. However, whether the actual environmental outcome is improved will depend on where environmental damage and FLW reduction occur, and the way price transmission connects these along the food supply chain. We find that, while a food waste reduction at the consumer level always improves the environmental outcome, this is not guaranteed when reducing losses from farm to retail. We thus derive a condition linking the price transmission mechanism and the environmental impact of a loss reduction. Simulating environmental outcomes based on a range of parameter values found in the literature, we find that reducing losses at or close to the farm level can increase the aggregate amount of GHG emissions, and therefore focusing on reducing consumer waste is more effective in reducing emissions. As for reducing natural resource use, both loss and waste reductions reduce the amount of land and water use, but effectiveness is reduced by heterogeneity in environmental impact. Relative to loss reductions, effectiveness of a waste reduction is amplified if there are environmentally damaging losses upstream in the value chain, but also dampened by vertical heterogeneity of sourcing along a value chain. The paper makes the case that more targeted instruments may be better suited to address typically local water scarcity and land use and degradation issues. © 2020 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Community-led green land acquisition: Social innovative initiatives for forest protection and regional development,"Land acquisition often involves power and displacement and can be carried out on a large scale. There are many forms of land acquisition, including for environmental and conservation purposes as well as for production activities. While green grabbing has joined land grabbing as an environmental justice issue of concern, it is not necessarily the case that all green land acquisition is large scale, done by powerful outsiders, or leads to displacement and exclusion. The outcomes of green land acquisition are dependent on the mechanisms used, the adequacy of resettlement and/or compensation, and the social and environmental context in which it happens. We discuss the outcomes of community-led land acquisition for conservation purposes in Costa Rica. We considered a special case of green land acquisition done by local civil society to defend the forest and water resources of the Juan Castro Blanco NationalWater Park in Costa Rica. We used the literature on green grabbing, social ecological systems, and social innovation to discuss local environmental governance and regional sustainable development. This paper makes a fresh contribution to environmental planning and environmental governance by bringing in aspects of green land acquisition that have not been previously explored. © 2020 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Social preferences regarding the delivery of ecosystem services in a semiarid Mediterranean region,"The valuation of ecosystem services has primarily been conducted within the context of the economic value of these services to society. Ecosystem services research has since advanced to identify conflicts of interest between different sectors of society while prioritizing conservation actions. This approach can be important in semiarid ecosystems, where biodiversity conservation can be hindered by a lack of community awareness. In the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula, conservation is perceived by society as a barrier to the economic development provided by agricultural or tourism activities. We use the contingent valuation method to identify community perception and economic values of different ecosystem services provided by semiarid ecosystems in the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula. This method identifies the perceptions of individuals benefiting from ecosystem services and examines their willingness to pay for the maintaining of these ecosystem services. Results showed that most respondents recognized the importance of services to human well-being and were willing to conserve these services. Preferences for maintaining water and air quality showed that respondents understood the relationship between the conservation of ecosystem services and local well-being. However, responses varied greatly across categories of beneficiaries; this finding highlights a potential conflict of interest that should be considered in any decision-making processes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
An overview of social-ecological impacts of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and climate change on Galapagos small-scale fisheries,"Small-scale fisheries in the Galapagos Marine Reserve face significant challenges due to climatic anomalies and human-induced changes such as weak governance and overfishing. This overview explores the social-ecological impacts of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and climate change on Galapagos small-scale fisheries, including the progress and challenges of ENSO and climate change research in this multiple-use marine protected area. The extreme El Niño events of 1982/83, 1997/98, and 2015/16 caused significant ecological shifts and fluctuations in fisheries productivity. While some species have shown increases in biomass, likely linked to sea surface temperature changes and altered ecosystem dynamics, the impacts on others remain uncertain or underexplored. Sailfin grouper (Mycteroperca olfax) and spiny lobster (Panulirus penicillatus and P. gracilis) fisheries have exhibited mixed responses to the El Niño, illustrating the complex nature of ENSO's ecological effects, which are further exacerbated by overfishing. The socio-economic impacts on fishing communities include reduced landings, longer search times, higher fishing costs, and increased livelihood insecurity. Future projections suggest an increasing vulnerability to ENSO and climate change, emphasizing the need for an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Key strategies include enhancing adaptive capacity, promoting sustainable practices, and adopting a social-ecological and transdisciplinary research approach. However, progress in ENSO and climate change research is hampered by weak governance, characterized by institutional barriers that hinder the formulation and enforcement of solid fisheries governance policies. To strengthen the resilience of Galapagos small-scale fisheries, interinstitutional and intersectoral collaboration is essential, supported by international cooperation and strategic investments to bolster local research capabilities. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Evidence for the impacts of agroforestry on ecosystem services and human well-being in high-income countries: a systematic map,"Background: Agroforestry bridges the gap that often separates agriculture and forestry by building integrated systems to address both environmental and socio-economic objectives. Existing empirical research has suggested that agroforestry—the integration of trees with crops and/or livestock—can prevent environmental degradation, improve agricultural productivity, increase carbon sequestration, and support healthy soil and healthy ecosystems while providing stable incomes and other benefits to human welfare. However, the extent of the literature supporting or refuting these claims has not been well documented. This study addresses this research gap by collating and describing the evidence for the impacts of agroforestry on ecosystem services and human well-being in high-income countries and presents the characteristics and gaps in the literature. Methods: We searched 5 primary databases and 24 organizational websites using a pre-defined search string designed to capture articles relating agroforestry practices and policy interventions to outcomes in high-income countries. Searches included peer-reviewed and grey literature published in the English language between January 1990 and June 2020. We screened the identified articles for inclusion or exclusion in two stages: title/abstract and full text. We extracted data from articles included at the full-text stage to form the map and associated database. For inclusion, the study in question must have assessed the impacts of the deliberate promotion and/or actual integration of woody perennials (trees, shrubs, etc.) with agricultural crops and/or animals. Results: Our search returned 31,852 articles of which we included 585 primary articles, 6 ongoing primary articles, and 41 systematically conducted literature reviews. The articles spanned three decades and 31 countries. The most studied practices are on linear boundary plantings (hedgerows, shelterbelts, windbreaks, and riparian buffers) and silvopasture systems. The most studied outcome is regulation and maintenance of physical, chemical, and biological conditions as an ecosystem service, followed by agricultural yield and mediation of waste/toxics/other nuisances (nutrient runoff and carbon storage). Conclusions: Results highlight key evidence gaps and areas where research has concentrated. Knowledge on the impacts of specific policy interventions to promote agroforestry remains scarce. The impacts of actual agroforestry practices are more well-studied, but the kinds of practices studied are limited, with most research focusing on two-component systems consisting of a simple tree configuration with one crop or livestock species, such as shelterbelts, windbreaks, and hedgerows, riparian buffers, and scattered trees on farms with crops and/or livestock. Regulating ecosystem services outcomes are by far the most studied, followed by agricultural productivity (an aspect of provisioning ecosystem services), while evidence on human well-being remains limited. We also found geographic biases, with little to no evidence for many countries. These biases suggest the strong need for further research to build the evidence base on agroforestry across high-income countries. The results can inform future research and policy decisions by making the evidence easily accessible and highlighting knowledge gaps as well as areas with enough evidence to conduct further systematic review. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Designing curriculum about governance and sustainability in higher education: A case study,"Introduction: Public administration has always been at the forefront of promoting sound and ethical values in society. The myriad of events that are shaping our world, such as global warming, deforestation, poverty and economic instability, calls for a shift from government to governance. This change demands a collaborative type of governance on the quest to implement sustainability. Collaborative governance can be initiated by its workforce, who are the individuals closest to the structures of public administration and can act as agents of change in this mission. Thus, personnel need to be equipped with the required knowledge, attitudes and skills, about and for, sustainable development. This can be addressed through education for sustainable development (ESD), a lifelong tool which requires adaption to national requirements, but most importantly to societal needs. Aim: This research focusses on a longitudinal case study from the Maltese islands, the smallest state of the European Union. Since enacting the Sustainable Development Act in 2012, through which sustainable development has been mainstreamed in the Maltese public sector, never was the need felt to educate public officers for sustainable development. Hence, this research aims at shedding light on the curriculum design process of an education module called ‘Public Administration and Sustainability’ as part of a Bachelor of Art’s programme at the University of Malta. Method: Framing an educational module in a tertiary institution requires tact in aligning the syllabus, not only to the pedagogical requirements, but also to the place of work. In this exploratory study, two research questions, each linked with a set of original hypotheses are tackled through a pool of data obtained from a variety of methodological tools employed, by analysing two important variables – the curriculum and the student. The former is reviewed through a content analysis exercise whereas feedback from the latter is scrutinised through a questionnaire. Findings: Data triangulation demonstrates that the curriculum design of the educational module promotes a holistic learning experience, since it integrates effectively the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains of the Bloom’s Taxonomy. Furthermore, the different student cohorts share common positive views about this module. Originality of Study: Previous studies indicate that there is a lacuna in research regarding curriculum design and review, especially regarding sustainable development. This research is significant as it attempts at filling this void by scrutinising closely curriculum design in higher ESD. Implications: Drawing upon the results, a number of recommendations are provided, among them is ‘The Multiplier Transformation Triad Model’, which portrays the institutional, educational and individual transformations needed to promote sustainability. Moreover, this research might provide more insights about governments’ commitment towards sustainability but should also serve useful to researchers or practitioners in various fields such as public administration, governance, sustainability and even higher education. © 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
"A cost-effective method to map mangrove forest extent, composition, and condition in small islands based on Sentinel-2 data: Implications for management","Despite their ecological, economic, and social importance, mangrove ecosystems suffer from high levels of degradation caused by a combination of anthropogenic stressors and the effects of climate change. Their degradation inevitably reduces the provision of ecosystem services and ultimately impacts human well-being, especially in coastal communities of Small Islands Developing States (SIDS). To timely identify and manage stressors causing local mangrove degradation, in situ monitoring is required. However, the financial means and human capacity to do so are often limited in SIDS, hampering adequate management of their mangrove forests. In search of a cost-effective alternative, we evaluated the use of Sentinel-2 satellites to monitor mangrove extent and species distribution in Lac Bay, a bay located on the small tropical island of Bonaire (Caribbean Netherlands). We also evaluated the mangrove's ecological condition through two biophysical variables 1) Effective Leaf Area Index (LAIe) and 2) Net Primary Productivity (NPP). Our results showed that Sentinel-2 data are a valuable tool for mapping the extent of mangrove forests in Bonaire and species composition (mean overall accuracy > 95 %). Using five Sentinel-2 images from 2021 and 2022, the extent of mangrove forests in Lac Bay was estimated to be on average 222.3 ha, of which 136.0 ha were classified as Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) and 77.1 ha as Avicennia germinans (black mangrove). Mean values for predicted LAIe ranged from 3.37 to 3.85 for Lac Bay, with significantly higher values in the wet season (3.82 ± 0.57) compared to the dry season (3.40 ± 0.56). The generic Simplified Level-2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) underestimated the LAIe values in Lac Bay, with moderate differences between SL2P values and in situ data (BDE = 0.41, RMSE = 1.09). Mean NPP values were estimated to be 8.82 ± 1.46 (g Cm−2 d -1). LAIe and NPP maps showed a zonal distribution, with highest values in the mid-West and East on the seaward side, and lowest values in the northern landward part of Lac Bay. The method developed in this study provides a cost-effective way to monitor the extent, composition, and ecological condition of mangrove forests, which can be used by small island states to make informed decisions about the management and protection of mangrove ecosystems. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Integration of water and energy planning to promote sustainability,"This paper examines the inter-linkages between the water and energy sectors and their planning processes, by describing a comprehensive analytical tool developed to evaluate water energy nexus operational cost trends and planning to assist decision makers in exploring and evaluating alternative courses of action. Brazil has been chosen as a case study, because its electricity production is highly dependent on water to keep affordable tariffs, which in turn also serves as input to other important sectors, such as water services and sanitation, and raises disputes especially in basins marked by water scarcity, such as the São Francisco basin. In light of hydrological factors (e.g., droughts) and non-hydrological factors (e.g., chronic delays in delivery of new plants) there has been water availability constraints for electricity generation and energy prices have risen, while water quantity and quality have decreased for multiple users. Both of which impact negatively on water services and sanitation providers, because electricity figures as their fastest growing costs in times when they need more energy to source water from longer distances, or deeper levels because of water quantity and quality issues. Energy and water are characterized as common pool resources with planning processes along silos in Brazil that do not serve well the purpose of sustainable development. Better integrated water-energy plans at basin level is the alternative proposed under this paper to advance sustainability and mitigate the risks related to water scarcity that have resulted in negative impacts on both electricity and water sectors. © 2019, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

Energy-water nexus: The energy sector’s water use,"Water and energy are critical resources that are reciprocally linked; this interdependence is often described as the water-energy nexus. Meeting energy-sector water needs, which are often large, depends upon the local availability of water for fuel production, hydropower generation, and thermoelectric power plant cooling. The U.S. energy sector’s use of water is significant in terms of water withdrawals and water consumption. Thermoelectric cooling represented 38% of freshwater withdrawn nationally and 45% of all water (fresh and saline) withdrawn in 2010, and the broader energy sector’s water use (including biofuels) represented around 14% of water consumed nationally. Energy-related water consumption is anticipated to continue to increase in coming decades as the result of more domestic biofuel and unconventional onshore oil and natural gas production. Policy makers at the federal, state, and local levels are faced with deciding whether to respond to the growing water needs of the energy sector, and if so, which policy levers to use (e.g., tax incentives, loan guarantees, permits, regulations, planning, or education). Many U.S. energy sector water decisions are made by private entities, and state entities have the majority of the authority over water use and allocation policies and decisions. For fuel production, water is either an essential input or is difficult and costly to substitute, and degraded water is often a waste byproduct that creates management and disposal challenges. U.S. unconventional oil and natural gas production has expanded quickly since 2008, and U.S. natural gas and coal exports may rise. This has sparked interest in the quantities of water and other inputs “embedded” in these resources, as well as the wastes produced (e.g., wastewaters from oil and natural gas extraction) and how they are reused or disposed (e.g., concerns over induced seismicity from injection of oil and natural gas wastewaters). Much of the growth in water demand for unconventional fuel production is concentrated in regions with already intense competition over water (e.g., tight gas and other unconventional production in Colorado, Eagle Ford shale gas and oil in south Texas), preexisting water concerns (e.g., groundwater decline in North Dakota before Bakken oil development), or regions with abundant, but ecologically sensitive surface water resources (e.g., Marcellus shale region in Pennsylvania and New York). Conventional hydropower accounts for approximately 8% of total U.S. net electricity generation, and more than 80% of U.S. electricity is generated at thermoelectric facilities that depend on cooling water. Water availability issues, such as regional drought, low flow, or intense competition for water, can curtail hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation. An assessment of the drought vulnerability of electricity in the western United States found broad resiliency, while also identifying the Pacific Northwest and the Texas grid at higher risk. Future withdrawals associated with electric generation may grow slightly, remain steady, or decline depending on a number of factors. These include reduced generation from facilities using once-through cooling because of compliance with proposed federal cooling water intake regulations or shifts in how electricity is generated (e.g., less from coal and more from certain natural gas technologies and wind). Energy choices represent complex tradeoffs; water use and wastewater byproducts are two of many factors to consider when making energy choices. For many policy makers, concerns other than water-low-cost reliable energy, energy independence and security, climate change mitigation, public health, and job creation-are more significant drivers of their positions on energy policies. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Pigs in space: Determining the environmental justice landscape of swine Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOS) in Iowa,"Given the primacy of Iowa in pork production for the U.S. and global markets, we sought to understand if the same relationship with traditional environmental justice (EJ) variables such as low income and minority populations observed in other concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) studies exists in the relationship with swine CAFO densities in Iowa. We examined the potential for spatial clustering of swine CAFOs in certain parts of the state and used spatial regression techniques to determine the relationships of high swine concentrations to these EJ variables. We found that while swine CAFOs do cluster in certain regions and watersheds of Iowa, these high densities of swine are not associated with traditional EJ populations of low income and minority race/ethnicity. Instead, the potential for environmental injustice in the negative impacts of intensive swine production require a more complex appraisal. The clustering of swine production in watersheds, the presence of antibiotics used in swine production in public waterways, the clustering of manure spills, and other findings suggest that a more literal and figurative “downstream” approach is necessary. We document the presence and location of antibiotics used in animal production in the public waterways of the state. At the same time, we suggest a more “upstream” understanding of the structural, political and economic factors that create an environmentally unjust landscape of swine production in Iowa and the Upper Midwest is also crucial. Finally, we highlight the important role of publicly accessible and high quality data in the analysis of these upstream and downstream EJ questions. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Not About Sufficiency
WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE DOING TO US AND FOR US?,"What are we doing to our climate? Emissions from fossil fuel burning have raised carbon dioxide concentrations 35 percent higher than in the past millions of years. This increase is warming our planet via the greenhouse effect. What is climate change doing to and for us? Dry regions are drier and wet ones wetter. Wildfires have increased threefold, hurricanes more violent, floods setting record heights, glaciers melting, and seas rising. Parts of Earth are increasingly uninhabitable. Climate change requires us to act as a global community. Climate justice enjoins emitters to pay the social-environmental costs of fossil fuel burning. This would expedite green solar, wind, and next-generation nuclear energy sources.

"The comparative performance of land sharing, land sparing type interventions on place-based human well-being","Environment-facing interventions impact the distribution, use of and access of natural resources and have important implications for all dimensions (material, relational, quality of life) of human well-being (HWB). Yet conventional impact metrics routinely surpass the non-material impacts which may be particularly salient in rural contexts where small-scale farmers depend directly on the land and biodiversity. Furthermore, little is known about the comparative performance of distinct interventions along a land-sharing, versus land sparing gradient, on local definitions of HWB. We address this knowledge gap, adopting a perception-based impact evaluation within communities across four intervention types representing the land sparing, sharing gradient: intensified industrial soy production (n = 60 HHs), a protected area (n = 70), an extractive reserve (n = 70) and a national forest (n = 70) in Pará in the Brazilian Amazon. We collected data using the Global Person Generated Index (GPGI) with household heads (n = 270) in eight communities (two per intervention type). Focus group discussions (n = 8) solicited residents' perceptions of impact pathways. Our findings highlight the important contribution of relational and subjective dimensions to HWB and call in to question the dominance of material measures in standard impact appraisals. Furthermore, we show that single sector and integrated approaches generate ‘polarized impact footprints’ in which integrated approaches achieve (a) more impact, which is (b) more often positive and (c) locally salient, the inverse is true for single-sector sparing style approaches. Areas of well-being that matter locally (culture, health and social relations), but are not impacted by interventions are relational, and point towards the potential of rights-based conservation to empower rural smallholders to remain in their communities while flourishing.

Reducing Youth In-Group Favoritism to Address Social Injustice,"Social injustices toward minority groups are pervasive around the world, and further exacerbated by global threats such as COVID-19 and climate change. Prosocial tendencies, such as empathy, moral reasoning, and helping behaviors directed only toward members of one's own social groups, discriminate against outgroups, and can perpetuate an unjust status quo. Yet, recent meta-analyses point to effective intervention programs that can foster prosocial responses across group lines. Developmental science has identified evidence-based interventions, policies, and programs to foster inclusive prosocial tendencies (toward both in-group and out-group members) to redress social injustices and inequities, and ultimately, lead to more just and peaceful societies. The recent developmental science informs five policy principles (e.g., developmental science, resilience, culture, collaboration, and sustainability) that can advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) around inclusion and peace. © The Author(s) 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Species richness increases income in agroforestry systems of eastern Amazonia,"Biodiversity is believed to reduce risks (resistance and resilience against perturbations), to increase productivity via niche expansion, and possibly also to improve resource efficiency via mutually benefic species interactions. Agroforestry has been postulated as an ideal pathway of maintaining or restoring biodiversity in a socioeconomically sustainable manner. This study tests the relevance of agroforestry species diversity and richness on socioeconomic performance in a wide range of agroforestry systems in 38 farms aggregated in four clusters of sites in eastern Amazonia. We cover both commercial and subsistence agroforestry, ranging from simply structured plantations to diverse systems (enriched fallows, multi-strata home gardens), as well as pastures and shifting cultivation for comparisons. We quantify (i) all cultivated species, classifying them economically into species with commercial value, primarily subsistence purpose species or ‘non-productive’ species, and (ii) socioeconomic system variables (costs, monetary/non-monetary income, degree of satisfaction). Land-use intensity (per-hectare costs and income) was highest in commercial agroforestry and subsistence home gardens, and lowest in enriched fallows and pastures. All agroforestry systems resulted in higher income:cost ratios and greater satisfaction than pastures and shifting cultivation. Net income, non-monetary income and income:cost ratio were maximum in home gardens. Total species richness was negatively related with costs and monetary income, but not with non-monetary income, due to occupation of space by ‘non-productive’ species (juveniles or species providing ecosystem services). By contrast, productive (combining commercial and subsistence) species richness was positively related with (mainly non-monetary) income, net income and income:cost ratio. According to GLM, both productive species richness and Shannon–Wiener diversity positively affected net income. Future efforts for food security and poverty reduction need to focus more on species-rich agroforestry systems, both in terms of applied research and of extension service programs. Notably, the ubiquitous and successful home gardens merit far more attention. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Not About Sufficiency
"Wheat yield predictions at a county and field scale with deep learning, machine learning, and google earth engine","To meet the challenges of climate change, increasing population and food demand, a timely, accurate and reliable estimation of crop yield at a large scale is more imperative than ever for crop management, food security evaluation, food trade and policy-making. In this study, taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example, we compared a traditional machine learning method (random forest, RF) and three deep learning (DL) models, including DNN (deep neural networks), 1D-CNN (1D convolutional neural networks), and LSTM (long short-term memory networks) to predict crop yields by integrating publicly available data within the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, including climate, satellite, soil properties, and spatial information data. The results showed that all four models could capture winter wheat yield variations in all the county-years, with R2 of recorded and simulated yields ranging from 0.83 to 0.90 and RMSE ranging from 561.18 to 959.62 kg/ha. They all performed well for winter wheat yield prediction at a county level from 2011 to 2015, with mean R2≥0.85 and RMSE ≤ 768 kg/ha. At a field level, the spatial pattern of estimated winter wheat yield could capture the spatial heterogeneity and yield differences between individual fields across a county fairly well. However, only the DNN and RF models had relatively good performance at the field level, with mean R2 values of 0.71, 0.66 and RMSE values of 1127 kg/ha and 956 kg/ha, respectively. The model comparisons showed that the performance of RF was not always worse than DL at both the county and field levels. Our findings demonstrated a scalable, simple and inexpensive framework for estimating crop yields at various scales in a timely manner and with reliable accuracy, which has important implications for crop yield forecasting, agricultural disaster monitoring, food trade policy, and food security warning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Can China achieve food security through the development of irrigation?,"China faces the dual challenge of water scarcity and food security with continued population growth. This paper explores methods to meet that demand without increasing agricultural water usage. The results show that China’s grain yield increased from 1.09 to 5.38 t/ha in 1949–2014 and may reach 6.13 t/ha in 2030. Further, food production increases can be achieved by increasing crop yield and enhancing irrigation efficiency (the ratio of crop irrigation water consumption to water diversion, IE). According to forecast scenarios, future grain yield will reach 5.86 t/ha if the ratio of total irrigated areas increases by 12.3%, while the IE will reach 0.583, lower than the planning goal of 0.600. The increase of water productivity proves that China can ensure its food security by improving IE and expanding irrigation areas with the water that is saved. The basic premise to ensure food security is to ensure that future investments in agricultural water and arable land are not reduced. The future should focus on provinces in the South, which is the major grain-producing area, in developing irrigation. The Northern regions have limited potential to develop irrigation and should therefore maintain the current scale of agricultural production to lay a solid foundation for food security in the future. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Not About Sufficiency
Net Value of Wetland Ecosystem Services in China,"Wetlands generate a wide range of ecosystem services that support human well-being and socioeconomic development. However, calculation of the value of these services generally fails to account for their costs. In order to understand the difference between the value and the net value of ecosystem services (VES and NES, respectively), we used government statistics and data from published papers about the values and costs of wetland services to calculate their NES in mainland China. After accounting for the opportunity costs, investment in wetland conservation and protection, and management to prevent natural disasters, the NES of China's wetlands totaled 828.1 × 109 RMB in 2014, which is 36.4% less than the VES of 1,301.9 × 109 RMB calculated using the traditional approach. From 1952 to 2014, the NES of wetlands across the country (adjusted for inflation) decreased from 2,215.9 × 109 RMB to 828.1 × 109 RMB. Accounting for the costs to determine the net value of ecosystem services will provide a better foundation to support land planning and utilization. ©2018. The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Reconceptualizing Resources: A Critique of Service-Dominant Logic,"This article examines the interactive relationship between intangible, human capabilities (operant resources) and tangible, physical assets (operand resources) in an era of global interconnectedness. It does so within the context of service-dominant logic and the challenge of sustainability in a world of resource scarcity. Introducing object-oriented philosophy as an alternative framework, this paper challenges ideas about the superiority of certain kinds of resources while confronting a pervasive culture of demateriality in marketing and contemporary post-industrial theory - the idea that ""stuff"" does not count. The article offers a parsimonious model of a more holistic conceptualization of resources. It demonstrates the complex entanglement of operant and operand resources, finding that this entanglement is a precondition to marketing-related issues of natural resource selection, globalization, sustainability, and distributive justice. © The Author(s) 2013.",Not About Sufficiency
Characterizing desired futures of Canadian communities,"In sustainability research and practice, one method widely used in exploration is visioning, in which desirable sustainable futures are articulated and explored in depth. Communities across Canada have used this method to develop collective desirable futures, in many cases to provide an end goal for local sustainable development. In this paper, we conduct a meta­-analysis of desired futures created by communities across Canada with the aim of identifying regional commonalities according to the three pillars of sustainability, social, environmental, and economic. Although sustainability demands a balance between its social, economic and environmental components, Canadians futures apparently place the greatest importance on social aspects with 338 desires against 222 and 230 respectively for economic and environmental sustainability. Community (105); Infrastructure, development, and transportation (126); and Natural environment (157) are the categories most frequently recorded within each of the three components of sustainability. The meta­analysis also noted significant differences amongst regions. The study was conducted in the context of an initiative known as the Sustainable Canada Dialogues that mobilized 60+ scholars from across the country around a consensus on science ­based, viable solutions for greenhouse gas reduction. Our results suggest that climate policy that simultaneously reduces greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing some of the key aspects of social sustainability would be attractive to many Canadians. © 2016 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
The impacts of data constraints on the predictive performance of a general process-based crop model (PeakN-crop v1.0),"Improving international food security under a changing climate and increasing human population will be greatly aided by improving our ability to modify, understand and predict crop growth. What we predominantly have at our disposal are either process-based models of crop physiology or statistical analyses of yield datasets, both of which suffer from various sources of error. In this paper, we present a generic process-based crop model (PeakN-crop v1.0) which we parametrise using a Bayesian model-fitting algorithm to three different sources: data-space-based vegetation indices, eddy covariance productivity measurements and regional crop yields. We show that the model parametrised without data, based on prior knowledge of the parameters, can largely capture the observed behaviour but the data-constrained model greatly improves both the model fit and reduces prediction uncertainty. We investigate the extent to which each dataset contributes to the model performance and show that while all data improve on the prior model fit, the satellite-based data and crop yield estimates are particularly important for reducing model error and uncertainty. Despite these improvements, we conclude that there are still significant knowledge gaps, in terms of available data for model parametrisation, but our study can help indicate the necessary data collection to improve our predictions of crop yields and crop responses to environmental changes. © Author(s) 2017.",Not About Sufficiency
"Equity, fairness, and the development of a sustainability ethos","Estimates made just before the 21st century indicate that, by the year 2100, Earth may have between 10 and 11 billion people-not quite double the 6 billion population count reached in October 1999. Sustainable use of the planet requires that human needs be met without impairing the integrity of the planet's ecological life support system. This objective will almost certainly require equity and fairness in resource allocation among members of the human species and with natural systems upon which humans depend. For the first time in history, humans have the power to create serious disequilibrium in natural systems at a global level. Nature is not vengeful, but it is opportunistic; new 'equilibrium conditions' are likely to be far less favorable to humans than present conditions. To prevent disequilibrium, a new ethos or set of guiding beliefs regarding human society's relationship with natural systems is essential. The best descriptor of the new ethos is eco-ethics (www.eeiu.org) guided by ethical science and implemented by compassionate, reasoned environmental politics. ESEP, the publication organ of the Eco-Ethics International Union, should be a powerful force in developing the necessary integration of science and value systems while maintaning the integrity of both. © Inter-Research 2001.",Not About Sufficiency
Identifying Ecosystem Services Bundles for Ecosystem Services Trade-Off/Synergy Governance in an Urbanizing Region,"Ecosystem services (ES) are the contribution of ecosystem structure and function to human well-being, connecting natural and socio-economic systems. ES trade-off/synergy has been one of the critical issues in sustainable environmental governance for guiding and formulating environmental policies. However, science-to-practice framework for ecosystem services trade-off/synergy governance are still rare. This study presents a comprehensive framework for identifying and managing trade-off and synergy of ESs in an urbanizing region. Using Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)—one of the fastest urbanizing regions in China—as a case, this study identified major ecosystem service bundles (ESBs) and applied the comprehensive framework to inform ES trade-off/synergy governance. The results showed that there were three stable ESBs in the GBA, and that ESB 1 (high grain production) and ESB 2 (high carbon sequestration) should be increased, and ESB 3 (all ES provision are low) should be increased. Moreover, there was large spatial–temporal change in ESBs in the central area of the GBA during 2000–2015 due to population and land urbanization. This study provides valuable information for sustainable land management and environmental governance in an urbanizing region. © 2022 by the author.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating satellite and climate data to predict wheat yield in Australia using machine learning approaches,"Wheat is the most important staple crop grown in Australia, and Australia is one of the top wheat exporting countries globally. Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine-learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD)level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark)and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network)to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI)from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R2 ˜ 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction. © 2019",Not About Sufficiency
Introducing perennial biomass crops into agricultural landscapes to address water quality challenges and provide other environmental services,"The world is faced with a difficult multiple challenge of meeting nutritional, energy, and other basic needs, under a limited land and water budget, of between 9 and 10 billion people in the next three decades, mitigating impacts of climate change, and making agricultural production resilient. More productivity is expected from agricultural lands, but intensification of production could further impact the integrity of our finite surface water and groundwater resources. Integrating perennial bioenergy crops in agricultural lands could provide biomass for biofuel and potential improvements on the sustainability of commodity crop production.

Environmental regulation and tax evasion when the regulator has incomplete information,"This paper analyzes the dynamic interaction between an environmental regulator and a polluting firm in a stock pollution Stackelberg game, where the regulator acts as the leader and the firm as the follower. The firm must determine the emissions required for production and pay a tax based on its reported emissions. The regulator chooses this tax on emissions to induce more environmentally respectful behavior of the firm. Evasion, defined as the gap between real and reported emissions can be discouraged using a fine. A central assumption in our analysis is that the regulator has incomplete information regarding the firm's objective function. The regulator does not know, but conjectures, how afraid the firm is of the fine for fraud. Based on this conjecture, the regulator estimates the firm's best-response functions and determines the tax. We compare the results when the regulator is accurate or misguided. Interestingly we find that when the regulator overestimates the firm's fear of the fine for fraud, social welfare can be greater than when he accurately estimates it. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Impacts of climate change on public health in India: Future research directions,"Background: Climate change and associated increases in climate variability will likely further exacerbate global health disparities. More research is needed, particularly in developing countries, to accurately predict the anticipated impacts and inform effective interventions. Objectives: Building on the information presented at the 2009 Joint Indo-U.S. Workshop on Climate Change and Health in Goa, India, we reviewed relevant literature and data, addressed gaps in knowledge, and identified priorities and strategies for future research in India. Discussion: The scope of the problem in India is enormous, based on the potential for climate change and variability to exacerbate endemic malaria, dengue, yellow fever, cholera, and chikungunya, as well as chronic diseases, particularly among the millions of people who already experience poor sanitation, pollution, malnutrition, and a shortage of drinking water. Ongoing efforts to study these risks were discussed but remain scant. A universal theme of the recommendations developed was the importance of improving the surveillance, monitoring, and integration of meteorological, environmental, geospatial, and health data while working in parallel to implement adaptation strategies. Conclusions: It will be critical for India to invest in improvements in information infrastructure that are innovative and that promote interdisciplinary collaborations while embarking on adaptation strategies. This will require unprecedented levels of collaboration across diverse institutions in India and abroad. The data can be used in research on the likely impacts of climate change on health that reflect India's diverse climates and populations.

The effect on ecological systems of remediation to protect human health,"Environmental remediation of contaminated ecosytems reduces stresses to these ecosystems, including stresses caused by the production, use, and storage of weapons of mass destruction. The effects of these various stressors on humans can be reduced by remediation or by blocking the exposure of humans, but blocking the exposure of resident biota is almost impossible. Remediation may involve trade-offs between reducing a minor risk to public health and increasing risks to workers and ecosystems. Remediation practices such as soil removal disrupt ecosystems, which take decades to recover. Without further human disturbances, and with low levels of exposure to stressors, ecosystems can recover from physical disruptions and spills. Remediation to remove negligible risk to humans can destroy delicate ecosystems for very little gain in public health.",Not About Sufficiency
Biogas originated from residual biomass in ecosystem services,"Human demand for the provisioning services of the ecosystem has been rising and shows the existence of trade-offs in their generation. Brazil is a great producer of agricultural commodities and animal protein, which generates a large amount of residual biomass throughout the production process, especially animal highly polluting waste concentrated in small areas. Ecosystems provide a wide range of services that are of fundamental importance to the well-being, health, subsistence and survival of human beings. The impacts of the waste generated by confined animals can degrade the ecosystem and reduce the services it can supply. Using waste to generate biogas does not require direct resources from the ecosystems to generate energy. In this context, it is an energy product classified as a provisioning service and, at the same time, an ecosystem regulating service, as it mitigates undesirable effects in the environment. The main goal of the classification of biogas as an ecosystem service is to explore its contributions to the ecosystem and to human well-being. © 2018, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

Rethinking the position of natural gas in a low-carbon energy transition,"Calls to phase out fossil fuels and shift to renewable energy-based solutions dominate the global discussion on low-carbon energy transition. However, the nature of this transition may vary across different countries on account of opportunities for innovative solutions that balance socio-economic and environmental sustainability goals. This piece argues that natural gas (NG) still has a vital role in the near to long-term future energy mix. This position implies that the objective of quickly phasing out NG needs reassessing. We further argue that there remains an opportunity for NG to be a key enabler of a “just” future net-zero emission energy system by mid-century, especially with the political-economic realities of certain countries and new technological innovations around NG utilisation. In this case, we argue that an essential element of “justice” could mean that nations at various levels of economic development adopt different approaches to the energy transition. Thus, decarbonisation efforts must consider socio-economic realities and the different contexts of technology application. The proposed uniform reduced energy demand and the blocking of public financing to NG projects lack the nuance of a sustainable solution, especially related to Sub-Saharan Africa. Accordingly, our analysis suggests that the one-size-fits-all approach to climate action in the context of natural gas commercialisation needs a rethink and countries should be allowed to define low-carbon pathways considering their local circumstances. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency

A Model for Disentangling Dependencies and Impacts among Human Activities and Marine Ecosystem Services,"Understanding and communicating the links among human activities and marine ecosystem services are fundamental for ecosystem-based management, which aims at attaining ecological, economic and social sustainability in the use of our seas. Relationships are typically complex and may differ between geographic areas. Here, an assessment model that combines available quantitative, semi-quantitative and qualitative information, rooted in the DAPSIR (Driver—Activity—Pressure—State—Impact—Response) framework and assessment requirements of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, is developed and applied. Focusing on Swedish marine waters, major human activities at sea are evaluated in relation to their dependencies and impacts on the status of marine ecosystem services. This case study is a consensus assessment based on evaluation of available literature and data. By relating degrees of dependencies and impacts to values of different economic sectors, discrepancies among sectors with respect to their impact versus their monetary value can be identified. In our case, commercial fishing depends on and influences a wide range of ecosystem services, while other sectors, such as shipping, depend little on marine ecosystem services. At the extreme end of the range, pressures from human activities in the past, such as historical nutrient emissions, still have prominent influence on ecosystem services today, entailing considerable losses. Marine tourism and commercial fishing show similar dependencies on ecosystem services, but tourism has a clearly lower impact on ecosystem services and a higher monetary value. The model may serve as a useful tool for communicating and guiding priorities in integrated environmental management and maritime spatial planning. © 2020, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Incentives, land use, and ecosystem services: Synthesizing complex linkages","Incentive schemes are increasingly used to motivate the supply of ecosystem services from agro-ecosystems through changes in land use and management. Here, I synthesize the complex effects of incentives on ecosystem services through their influence on land use and management. Linkages between incentives and land use change, and between land use change and ecosystem services can be one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. Change in land use and management can affect multiple ecosystem services, with both co-benefits and trade-offs. Incentives can motivate multiple changes in land use and management and multiple incentives often interact with both synergies and tensions in their effect upon ecosystem services. These vary over both space and time, and can be non-linear. Depending on incentive design, changes in ecosystem service supply can also have a feedback effect on incentive prices. I suggest that continued quantitative development is required to further explore these linkages: in the influence of incentives on land use change; in the impact of land use change on ecosystem services, and; in ecosystem service supply feedbacks on incentive prices. Quantifying and understanding these linkages is essential to progress more comprehensive analyses of the impact of incentives on ecosystem services, and the design of incentives capable of realizing synergies and avoiding tensions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
An exploratory case study of food sharing practices in Caribbean countries through a transition lens using intergenerational dyad interviews,"Background: Caribbean populations face complex health issues related to diet and food security as they undergo a rapid nutrition transition, resulting in some of the world’s highest number of premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Despite policy efforts to promote local and regional food consumption, reliance on food imports remains high with many Caribbean countries importing more than 80% of their food from larger economies. Previous regional research revealed the importance of food sharing practices in the Caribbean, with implications for the consumption of local foods, food security, and community resilience against climate change. However, there is limited understanding of these practices and how they have evolved. Methods: Using a transition lens, we explored the generational, life course, and sociocultural factors influencing food sharing practices in the Caribbean. We conducted semistructured online interviews with 10 intergenerational dyads involved in food sharing recruited from the virtual campus of the University of West Indies. Our study sample included 20 participants, ranging from 18 to 83 years old, from five English-speaking Caribbean countries (6 different islands). Results: Food sharing practices had a central role within the social fabric of all participants, contributing to their mental health and well-being. They represented a fundamental aspect of participants’ culture and traditions, driving a sense of belonging and connection among Caribbean communities. However, contemporary food sharing practices indicated a move towards more convenience-oriented and processed foods, with reduced time spent cooking and a decline in the use of food sources such as backyard gardens, fishing, and marketplaces, with a preference for supermarkets. These trends, particularly observed among younger generations, aligned with the ongoing nutrition transition in the Caribbean and were influenced by various sociopolitical and environmental factors such as climate events, economic fluctuations, urbanisation, and changing family structures. Conclusions: The evolving landscape of food sharing practices in the Caribbean has linkages with various domains of nutrition, health, society, culture, environment and globalisation. While a transition towards less healthy diets will increase the risk of many NCDs, the intrinsic cultural, social, and emotional benefits of food sharing could also positively impact health outcomes in the Caribbean region. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"A Brief Summary of Environment Canada's Involvement in the Chemical, Biological, Radiological-Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) Research & Technology Initiative (CRTI)","After the first attack on the World Trade Center in New York City in 1993, Environment Canada (now Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)) and other federal departments began to address their respective role in responding to a major politically motivated attack. The terrorist events of September 2001 and the threats of similar incidents over time have kept this issue at the forefront. The federal government has invested significant resources to advance and improve its prevention, preparedness, response and recovery capabilities. Led by Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC), the Chemical, Biological, Radiological-Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) Research & Technology Initiative (CRTI) was established early in 2002. The role played by Environment Canada was especially relevant to CRTI, as the environment and public security were two of the highest profile topics in terms of the political future of the nation, in terms of public security, public health and public interest. Environment Canada was one of the lead federal departments on several major interdepartmental CRTI funded projects over the first 10 years of CRTI and participated in a supporting role in projects lead by other departments. Brief details and background information on these Research and Development, Technology Demonstration, Technology Acceleration and Technology Acquisition projects are provided along with a bibliography of published papers, reports, and patents resulting from these efforts. Environment Canada led projects have improved Canada's ability to respond to a range of safety and security risks including CBRNE terrorism through the development and dissemination of S&T knowledge, exercises, training and the acquisition of technology to address current and emerging CBRNE threats. In addition to counterterrorism, these projects helped develop effective tools to respond to a variety of industrial and natural environmental emergencies. This paper aims to summarize Environment Canada's involvement the initial 10 years of the CBRNE Research and Technology Initiative and speaks to ECCC's continued scientific support to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's (RCMP's) National CBRNE Team as well as its relationship with the Centre for Security Science (CSS). © 2014 Association for Information Systems.

Clearing the air and breathing freely: The health politics of air pollution and asthma,"This study examines the growing debate around environmental causes of asthma in the context of federal regulatory disputes, scientific controversy, and environmental justice activism. A multifaceted form of social discovery of the effect of air pollution on asthma has resulted from multipartner and multiorganizational approaches and from intersectoral policy that deals with social inequality and environmental justice. Scientists, activists, health voluntary organizations, and some government agencies and officials have identified various elements of the asthma and air pollution connection. To tackle these issues, they have worked through a variety of collaborations and across different sectors of environmental regulation, public health, health services, housing, transportation, and community development. The authors examine the role of activist groups in discovering the increased rates of asthma and framing it as a social and environmental issue; give an overview of the current knowledge base on air pollution and asthma, and the controversies within science; and situate that science in the regulatory debate, discussing the many challenges to the air quality researchers. They then examine the implications of the scientific and regulatory controversies over linking air pollution to increases in asthma.

The effectiveness of negotiations over international river claims,"Rising demand for water in water-scarce areas has led to frequent predictions of looming ""water wars,"" although evidence suggests that water is also an important source of cooperation. This paper follows up on recent research suggesting that river disagreements are more likely to lead to both militarized conflict and peaceful negotiations when water demands and water scarcity are greatest, but that river treaties have generally prevented militarization while increasing negotiations. Here, we examine the effectiveness of these negotiations, in order to determine whether factors that promote negotiation onset have different effects on negotiation outcomes. Empirical analysis suggests that negotiations are most likely to succeed when they concern rivers with high value for the negotiating states (with many uses offering the possibility of negotiating tradeoffs), when they concern a current rather than future problem, and when the adversaries share closer overall relations, but less likely when water scarcity is more acute and when they involve a cross-border river with a stronger upstream state. © 2011 International Studies Association.",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of climate change on food security of small islands: The case of Mauritius,"This paper studies the implications of high food prices resulting from climate change on food security in small islands, using Mauritius as a case-study. Climate change may adversely impact prices of agricultural commodities. The study derives and calculates the government costs and the welfare effects of an increase in the world price of rice on consumers in Mauritius. Using an equilibrium displacement model, this study finds that an increase in the price of rice by 35%, as predicted by the literature on climate change and rice prices, will result in an increase of 28.8% in government spending, representing the additional outlays to support the subsidy scheme for food security. Using 2012 as the baseline, the welfare analysis results suggest that consumer surplus for ration rice consumers increases by 626 million Mauritian Rupees (MUR) or US$18 million while consumer surplus decreases by MUR454 million (US$13 million) for basmati rice consumers. © 2019 The Authors.

End-of-waste life: Inventory of alternative end-of-use recirculation routes of bio-based plastics in the European Union context,"The bio-based products market is currently limited resulting in relatively small quantities of waste streams, viewed as contaminants of conventional waste streams. The steady growth of bio-based products however, drives the need to investigate their End-of-Use (EoU)/End-of-Life (EoL) alternatives. A critical review of the inventory of targeted valorization options for bio-based plastic waste is presented with limitations and opportunities. Impacts on the conventional waste management routes and the environment are considered. The provisions of the circular economy package, the targets and objectives set by the relevant EU environmental legislation, are used as key drivers for developing the inventory of the alternative EoU/EoL routes. Optimal alternative EoU/EoL routes are defined for the bio-based products in such a way that they are turned into valuable resources for the circular economy. This is a prerequisite to promote recirculation of bio-based by-products and waste streams along the whole chain of their production and use. The expected impacts include reduction of public health and environmental pollution problems, preservation of natural resources, reduction of GHG emissions, avoidance of landscape deterioration and land and marine littering. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Not About Sufficiency

Threshold electricity consumption enables multiple sustainable development goals,"Access to sufficient amounts of energy is a prerequisite for the development of human well-being. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognize the interconnectedness of climate change, energy access and development. However, not all SDG targets are quantified, leaving room for ambiguity in fulfilling, for example, the goal of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all (SDG7). We show how specific sustainable development targets for health indicators are strongly correlated with electricity consumption levels in the poorest of countries. Clear thresholds in per capita electricity consumption of a few hundred kWh per year are identified by analyzing SDG indicator data as a function of per capita country electricity consumption. Those thresholds are strongly correlated with meeting of SDG 3 targets-below the identified thresholds, countries do not meet the SDG targets, while above the threshold there is a clear relationship between increasing consumption of electricity and improvement of SDG indicators. Electricity consumption of 400 kWh per capita is significantly higher than projections made by international agencies for future energy access, but only 5%-10% that of OECD countries. At the very least, the presence of thresholds and historical data patterns requires an understanding of how SDG targets would be met in the absence of this threshold level of electricity access. © 2019 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Resilience of ecosystem services - Applying ecosystem function and integrity concepts to natural sweet chestnut forests in Belasitza mountain (SW Bulgaria),"In the sustainable development concept the successful societal responses to conserve biodiversity are the key for maintaining ecosystem processes and structures, which is the basis for providing ecosystem services. Ecosystem services and resilience concepts have been seen as promising ways to analyse complex and coupled human-environment interactions, but there are some problems regarding both concepts. Ecosystem services encompass benefits of nature to human community, and emphasise that ecosystem structures and processes provide variety of services used by people to maintain the human well-being. Resilience concept has been used to assess sustainability of coupled socio-ecological systems, taking into account feedbacks between social and ecological realms, implying that system is resilient if it can maintain its structures and functions despite disturbances. The concept of Ecosystem Services (ESS) deals with the benefits and goods which are provided by specific ecosystem structures and functions for anthropogenic utilisation. Therefore the concept is suitable for identifying consequences of changes in ecosystems. The results from these concept analyse for chestnut forests in Belasitza Mt's are discussed.",Not About Sufficiency
Strategies and tactics to reduce the impact of healthcare on climate change: systematic review,"OBJECTIVE To review the international literature and assess the ways healthcare systems are mitigating and can mitigate their carbon footprint, which is currently estimated to be more than 4.4% of global emissions. DESIGN Systematic review of empirical studies and grey literature to examine how healthcare services and institutions are limiting their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. DATA SOURCES Eight databases and authoritative reports were searched from inception dates to November 2023. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Teams of investigators screened relevant publications against the inclusion criteria (eg, in English; discussed impact of healthcare systems on climate change), applying four quality appraisal tools, and results are reported in accordance with PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses). RESULTS Of 33 737 publications identified, 32 998 (97.8%) were excluded after title and abstract screening; 536 (72.5%) of the remaining publications were excluded after full text review. Two additional papers were identified, screened, and included through backward citation tracking. The 205 included studies applied empirical (n=88, 42.9%), review (n=60, 29.3%), narrative descriptive (n=53, 25.9%), and multiple (n=4, 2.0%) methods. More than half of the publications (51.5%) addressed the macro level of the healthcare system. Nine themes were identified using inductive analysis: changing clinical and surgical practices (n=107); enacting policies and governance (n=97); managing physical waste (n=83); changing organisational behaviour (n=76); actions of individuals and groups (eg, advocacy, community involvement; n=74); minimising travel and transportation (n=70); using tools for measuring GHG emissions (n=70); reducing emissions related to infrastructure (n=63); and decarbonising the supply chain (n=48). CONCLUSIONS Publications presented various strategies and tactics to reduce GHG emissions. These included changing clinical and surgical practices; using policies such as benchmarking and reporting at a facility level, and financial levers to reduce emissions from procurement; reducing physical waste; changing organisational culture through workforce training; supporting education on the benefits of decarbonisation; and involving patients in care planning. Numerous tools and frameworks were presented for measuring GHG emissions, but implementation and evaluation of the sustainability of initiatives were largely missing. At the macro level, decarbonisation approaches focused on energy grid emissions, infrastructure efficiency, and reducing supply chain emissions, including those from agriculture and supply of food products. Decarbonisation mechanisms at the micro and meso system levels ranged from reducing low value care, to choosing lower GHG options (eg, anaesthetic gases, rescue inhalers), to reducing travel. Based on these strategies and tactics, this study provides a framework to support the decarbonisation of healthcare systems. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Socio-economic predictors of environmental performance among African nations,"Socio-economic changes in Africa have increased pressure on the continent’s ecosystems. Most research investigating environmental change has focused on the changing status of specific species or communities and protected areas, but has largely neglected the broad-scale socio-economic conditions underlying environmental degradation. We tested national-scale hypotheses regarding the socio-economic predictors of ecosystem change and degradation across Africa, hypothesizing that human density and economic development increase the likelihood of cumulative environmental damage. Our combined environmental performance rank includes national ecological footprint, proportional species threat, recent deforestation, freshwater removal, livestock density, cropland coverage, and per capita emissions. Countries like Central African Republic, Botswana, Namibia, and Congo have the best relative environmental performance overall. Structural equation models indicate that increasing population density and overall economic activity (per capita gross domestic product corrected for purchasing-power parity) are the most strongly correlated with greater environmental degradation, while greater wealth inequality (Gini index) correlates with better environmental performance. This represents the first Africa-scale assessment of the socio-economic correlates of environmental degradation, and suggests that dedicated family planning to reduce population growth, and economic development that limits agricultural expansion (cf. intensification) are needed to support environmental sustainability. © 2019, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
The Pre-modern World and Management: An Introduction,"In this introduction to our section on pre-modern management, the central question that is addressed is the following: were ancient and feudal managerial systems comparable to those found in modern, liberal-democratic societies? The answer to this question is “no.” For although pre-modern forms of management were characterized by the attributes described in most textbooks (i.e., planning, organizing, leading, controlling), they lacked other characteristic features of “modern management.” Pre-modern production was rarely directed toward competitive markets. Mass markets were even more uncommon. Instead, the tyranny of distance, and a reliance on either muscle power or wind in terms of transport, restricted most production to local markets. An absence of competitive markets meant that pre-modern managers were little concerned with costs. Pre-modern managers also differed from their modern counterparts in that they typically operated with few of the protections of both property and person that are the norm in today’s democratic societies. In the past, un free forms of labor were also commonplace. Due to a lack for smelted metals, pre-modern managers and producers also lacked durable capital equipment. This weakness manifested itself in both low levels of capital intensity and energy usage. Such failings, in all pre-modern societies, resulted in living standards inferior to those of our own. Nevertheless, for all its failings, “modern management” owes its success to the travails of past managers. In looking to the past, therefore, we need to both acknowledge our debt to bygone eras and recognize the advances built on past sacrifices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Not About Sufficiency
Unlocking the potential of faba bean in Moroccan agriculture: a review- from research to perspective,"The world's growing population and the need for food security require rigorous research and development towards climate change-resilient agroecosystems and a major shift toward grain legumes. Faba bean is an important crop in Morocco, providing an essential source of vegetable protein for both humans and livestock with outstanding agronomic, nutritional, and environmental properties. In this review, we present an overview of faba bean crops, including their history, botany, production, importance, and main biotic and abiotic constraints, as well as state-of-theart scientific research on faba bean in Morocco. We also propose insights as future strategies to unlock the potential of faba bean in Moroccan agriculture. Despite its numerous benefits, the cultivation of Vicia faba varieties faces several challenges, including low yield, weeds, pests, disease problems, and climate change. To fully realize the potential of faba bean, there are opportunities for future crop development, including genetic improvement, sustainable intensification, market development, and climate-smart agriculture. Increased investment in research and development, extension services, and infrastructure, as well as constructive agricultural policy strategies, is necessary to increase the number of pulses in various Moroccan cropping systems. By unlocking the potential of faba bean, Morocco can ensure future food and feed security and contribute to the sustainable development of its agricultural sector. © 2023 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",Not About Sufficiency
"Mining resources, the inconvenient truth of the “ecological” transition","By 2035, the International Energy Agency predicts that $48 trillion will need invested to meet global energy needs, with at least half of these amounts needed to be funneled into renewable electricity sources and energy efficiency efforts. The energy transition is an important dimension of a global climate change mitigation strategy. Using open data on transnational mining deals from the Land Matrix Initiative, we display the current transnational mining network with patterns of concentration and new forms of dependencies between investing and target countries. Using different global development metrics, we also characterize the context within which the mining network is embedded in. Beyond geopolitical concerns and the reconfiguration of power relations in international arenas, the energy transition raises issues of environmental justice. In this study, we clearly display distributive injustices with inequitable distribution of costs, with target countries supporting most of the social and environmental costs of resource extraction in areas marked by land and food insecurity and instability in terms of governance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Policy and effective action for soil security: A need for reframing the soil story,"Soil science is a vital scientific discipline producing cutting-edge research in its various sub-disciplines. Its role in studying major environmental issues, often defined as food security, water and energy availability, climate change and biodiversity loss, is, however, less obvious to stakeholders, policy makers and the public at large. It deserves better. Reframing the soil story by taking a pro-active interdisciplinary approach in demonstrating the role of soils when studying these issues is advocated in the context of the ten Sustainable Development Goals. Soil change matters not only in a negative way when referring to erosion and degradation but also, and particularly, to soil improvement. But only successfully completed programs in practice will be convincing and that's why an active role of soil researchers and soil scientists, acting as knowledge brokers, is advocated in transdisciplinary programs. This includes more emphasis on preparation and implementation than is allowed in current programs. A case study is presented and a narrative is used to link the five major environmental issues in a logical sequence, showing their interdependence. Current soil research and education programs should reflect demands made by inter- and transdisciplinary approaches and need a new, fresh approach. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Building consensus on water use assessment of livestock production systems and supply chains: Outcome and recommendations from the FAO LEAP Partnership,"The FAO Livestock Environmental Assessment and Performance (LEAP) Partnership organised a Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to develop reference guidelines on water footprinting for livestock production systems and supply chains. The mandate of the TAG was to i) provide recommendations to monitor the environmental performance of feed and livestock supply chains over time so that progress towards improvement targets can be measured, ii) be applicable for feed and water demand of small ruminants, poultry, large ruminants and pig supply chains, iii) build on, and go beyond, the existing FAO LEAP guidelines and iv) pursue alignment with relevant international standards, specifically ISO 14040 (2006)/ISO 14044 (2006), and ISO 14046 (2014). The recommended guidelines on livestock water use address both impact assessment (water scarcity footprint as defined by ISO 14046, 2014) and water productivity (water use efficiency). While most aspects of livestock water use assessment have been proposed or discussed independently elsewhere, the TAG reviewed and connected these concepts and information in relation with each other and made recommendations towards comprehensive assessment of water use in livestock production systems and supply chains. The approaches to assess the quantity of water used for livestock systems are addressed and the specific assessment methods for water productivity and water scarcity are recommended. Water productivity assessment is further advanced by its quantification and reporting with fractions of green and blue water consumed. This allows the assessment of the environmental performance related to water use of a livestock-related system by assessing potential environmental impacts of anthropogenic water consumption (only “blue water”); as well as the assessment of overall water productivity of the system (including “green” and “blue water” consumption). A consistent combination of water productivity and water scarcity footprint metrics provides a complete picture both in terms of potential productivity improvements of the water consumption as well as minimizing potential environmental impacts related to water scarcity. This process resulted for the first time in an international consensus on water use assessment, including both the life-cycle assessment community with the water scarcity footprint and the water management community with water productivity metrics. Despite the main focus on feed and livestock production systems, the outcomes of this LEAP TAG are also applicable to many other agriculture sectors. © 2021 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency

Local communities must be involved in planning to address potential social impacts. The research conducted in a specific region contributed to understanding the ecological transition's impact on the community. However, the study faced limitations in data collection and logistics.The Moroccan government has initiated programs to improve water use efficiency, such as drip irrigation, wastewater reuse, and dam construction to store water during drought periods.

Livestock and water: Understanding the context based on the comprehensive assessment of water management in agriculture,"The recently completed 'Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture' (CA) assessed the benefits, costs and impacts of the past 50 years of water development. It highlighted important trends that frame the challenges in water resources management of today and into the future, and critically evaluated solutions that people have developed to cope with these challenges. Important past trends include increases in food production that have outpaced population growth, much of this due to a doubling of the global irrigated area between 1961 and 2003, and accompanying declines in the health of aquatic ecosystems resulting from demands for, and impacts of, water use in agriculture. The future will bring new pressures on water resources and ecosystems as demands from sectors other than agriculture increase (including water for biofuel production), populations rise and become more wealthy, which leads to demand for foods that are more water intensive to produce, and climate change increases uncertainty and risk in our agricultural systems. Modelling predictions and analysis of scenarios show that water demand may rise from between only 20 up to 90% over the next 50 years, depending on how we choose to manage water in agricultural systems in the future. Owing to the importance of meat in changing diets and the role of livestock in managing land degradation, livestock is central to many of the issues that will determine whether or not optimistic scenarios (minimised increased demand for agricultural water in the future) can be achieved. This paper briefly summarises the insights and results of the CA, and highlights the areas where livestock management is most closely related to major water challenges and global recommendations of the CA. The purpose of this introductory paper is to set the context within which the importance of enhancing livestock water productivity in mixed farming systems can be appreciated. © Australian Rangeland Society 2009.",Not About Sufficiency

Integrating islands of knowledge for greater synergy and efficiency in crop research,"A transnational approach to plant science is required to address global challenges such as food security and climate change. Action from the plant, crop and agricultural science communities will be required to meet these challenges. Islands of knowledge (e.g. crop, discipline, scale, environment, organization) need to be better integrated. Mapping is needed to identify gaps and make connections between these islands. Translational research, spanning from the molecular to farm scale, should be the focus. We need more integrators' to manage complex global projects and integration should be recognized as an important skill in itself. We need to advocate teamwork over individuality - and reward teams. Impact should be taken much more seriously as an outcome and we need to better understand impact pathways.

Global health and development: Conceptualizing health between economic growth and environmental sustainability,"After World War II, health was firmly integrated into the discourse about national development. Transition theories portrayed health improvements as part of an overall development pattern based on economic growth as modeled by the recent history of industrialization in high-income countries. In the 1970s, an increasing awareness of the environmental degradation caused by industrialization challenged the conventional model of development. Gradually, it became clear that health improvements depended on poverty-reduction strategies including industrialization. Industrialization, in turn, risked aggravating environmental degradation with its negative effects on public health. Thus, public health in low-income countries threatened to suffer from lack of economic development as well as from the results of global economic development. Similarly, demands of developing countries risked being trapped between calls for global wealth redistribution, a political impossibility, and calls for unrestricted material development, which, in a world of finite land, water, air, energy, and resources, increasingly looked like a physical impossibility, too.Various international bodies, including the WHO, the Brundtland Commission, and the World Bank, tried to capture the problem and solution strategies in development theories. Broadly conceived, two models have emerged: a ""localist model,"" which analyzes national health data and advocates growth policies with a strong focus on poverty reduction, and a ""globalist"" model, based on global health data, which calls for growth optimization, rather than maximization. Both models have focused on different types of health burdens and have received support from different institutions. In a nutshell, the health discourse epitomized a larger controversy regarding competing visions of development. © 2012 The Author.",Not About Sufficiency
The Effectiveness of Payments for Environmental Services,"We adopt a theory-based approach to synthesize research on the effectiveness of payments for environmental services in achieving environmental objectives and socio-economic co-benefits in varying contexts. Our theory of change builds on established conceptual models of impact pathways and highlights the role of (1) contextual dimensions (e.g., political, institutional, and socio-economic conditions, spatial heterogeneity in environmental service values and provision costs, and interactions with pre-existing policies), and (2) scheme design (e.g., payment type and level, contract length, targeting, and differentiation of payments) in determining environmental and socio-economic outcomes. To shed light on the overall effectiveness of payment schemes, and its determinants, we review counterfactual-based empirical evaluations, comparative analyses of case-studies, and meta-analyses. Our review suggests that program effectiveness often lags behind the expectations of early theorists. However, we also find that theory has advanced sufficiently to identify common reasons for why payment schemes fail or succeed. Moreover, payment schemes are often rolled out along with other policy instruments in so-called policy mixes. Advances in theory and evaluation research are needed to improve our understanding of how such policy mixes interact with the targeted social-ecological systems. © 2017",Not About Sufficiency
Wildlife consumption patterns during a complex humanitarian and environmental crisis,"Each year, people living near the world's most biodiverse places experience seemingly insurmountable challenges, using limited natural resources to meet immediate needs. Unfortunately, such pressures can place endemic wildlife at risk of extinction. Despite the increasing occurrence of severe human crises, studies on human-wildlife interactions under such crises are limited. We interviewed 4150 members of 909 rural families living near an endangered UNESCO World Heritage Site during an extended severe drought and food crisis to better understand how humans and forests interact in places of critical need. Nearly every family was food insecure, with shortages severe enough to force frequent meal skipping, reduction, and seed stock consumption. Domestic meat consumption and availability was low, and one-third of families ate wild meat. One-fifth of wild meat was purchased, with lemur meat comprising a quarter of all wild meat bought. Further, almost half of all lemur meat was purchased. This is among the highest proportion of both purchased wildlife and lemur meat found thus far in rural Madagascar, highlighting an unexpected market-driven dynamic to wildlife consumption during this crisis. Families who ate lemurs were wealthier but significantly less food secure, using more strategies to cope with severe food shortages. As Madagascar's wildlife and food security decline, remaining lemurs may be increasingly purchased by rural food-insecure homes with sufficient access to cash income, especially in shock-prone rural regions. Improving meat availability and long non-staple food supply chains to such regions may improve the future of people and lemurs alike. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
A water risk index for portfolio exposure to climatic extremes: Conceptualization and an application to the mining industry,"Corporations, industries and non-governmental organizations have become increasingly concerned with growing water risks in many parts of the world. Most of the focus has been on water scarcity and competition for the resource between agriculture, urban users, ecology and industry. However, water risks are multi-dimensional. Water-related hazards include flooding due to extreme rainfall, persistent drought and pollution, either due to industrial operations themselves, or to the failure of infrastructure. Most companies have risk management plans at each operational location to address these risks to a certain design level. The residual risk may or may not be managed, and is typically not quantified at a portfolio scale, i.e. across many sites. Given that climate is the driver of many of these extreme events, and there is evidence of quasi-periodic climate regimes at inter-annual and decadal timescales, it is possible that a portfolio is subject to persistent, multi-year exceedances of the design level. In other words, for a multi-national corporation, it is possible that there is correlation in the climate-induced portfolio water risk across its operational sites as multiple sites may experience a hazard beyond the design level in a given year. Therefore, from an investor's perspective, a need exists for a water risk index that allows for an exploration of the possible space and/or time clustering in exposure across many sites contained in a portfolio. This paper represents a first attempt to develop an index for financial exposure of a geographically diversified, global portfolio to the time-varying risk of climatic extremes using long daily global rainfall datasets derived from climate re-analysis models. Focusing on extreme daily rainfall amounts and using examples from major mining companies, we illustrate how the index can be developed. We discuss how companies can use it to explore their corporate exposure, and what they may need to disclose to investors and regulators to promote transparency as to risk exposure and mitigation efforts. For the examples of mining companies provided, we note that the actual exposure is substantially higher than would be expected in the absence of space and time correlation of risk as is usually tacitly assumed. We also find evidence for the increasing exposure to climate-induced risk, and for decadal variability in exposure. The relative vulnerability of different portfolios to multiple extreme events in a given year is also demonstrated. © 2017 Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Poverty Eradication Through Green Economy: A Case Study Of Two Villages Of Lakhimpur District Under Narayanpur Region,"Based on the economic development concept, it is the sustainable development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The economic growth of a nation, directly and indirectly, depends on environmental degradation. Initially, it is said that a developed nation may be used in developing nations as a dumping ground of pollution. Heavily carbon emitted or pollution based industry are being shifted to developing nations. Developing nations need such type of economic growth as well as development which can achieve growth and development, create employment opportunities, gender equality, caste equality, improved standard of living, environmentally friendly methods of production, easily available credit support system. Such an economy is called a green economy. Poverty is the main problem which creates difficulty to implement green economy because of the societal issue-social scar which decreases the livelihood security and further environment degradation leads to worsening poverty. This paper attempts to discuss how green economy can improve human well being and social equity through the development of soft and economic infrastructure with special emphasis on sewage, roads and communication, education and health sector. The present study is conducted in two villages of Lakhimpur district in the state of Assam. The study will be based upon both primary and secondary data.

The circular economy and the optimal recycling rate: A macroeconomic approach,"This paper studies the economic implications of the circular economy and recycling activities from a macroeconomic perspective. The paper incorporates the circular economy into an otherwise standard neoclassical dynamic general equilibrium linear economy model, in which the production function depends on capital, labor, and raw materials. Raw materials are a composite of natural resources (the linear economy) and recycled material (the circular economy). Waste is a function of consumption but can be incorporated back into production activities through recycling. We find the existence of a positive S-shaped relationship between the optimal recycling rate and economic development, indicating that increasing the circularity of the economy is a necessary condition to augment social welfare in a growing economy. The optimal recycling rate depends positively on the pollution damage and waste content of final consumption goods. Simulation of the model supports the existence of a steady-state Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) relationship between the stock of waste and the output in the presence of a circular economy. Finally, we find that while a permanent improvement in recycling technology has positive effects on output, expanding the circularity of the economy, an increase in the cost of natural material has harmful effects on output, increasing waste accumulation and reducing recycling. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Upending climate violence research: Fossil fuel corporations and the structural violence of climate change,"There is a high-profile body of work asserting a link between anthropogenic climate change and increased rates of violence. There is also an expanding literature that is highly skeptical of this research. Critics point out that (1) this research has so far produced widely divergent findings, and that there is no consensus on a causal link between climate and the incidence of conflict. Critics also argue that much climate violence research (2) draws upon a longdiscredited environmental determinism, (3) rehashes colonial stereotypes of the global South, (4) naturalizes and depoliticizes inequalities within and between nations, and (5) potentially creates new rationales for militarism and intervention from more powerful states. In the following essay, I build on these critiques, arguing that orthodox climate conflict research also focuses unduly on the potential climate-related violence of the poor, overlooking the violence of the powerful. Drawing from a climate justice perspective, I advocate for more study on the structural violence of climate change. To make this case, I focus on the world’s largest publicly traded fossil fuel companies. © Society for Human Ecology.",Not About Sufficiency
Diversionary Post-Coal Politics in South Africa: A Chinese Solar-Powered Industrial Zone Controversy,"In September 2021 at a United Nations climate summit in New York, Xi Jinping announced that there would be no further Chinese coal-fired power plants along the Belt and Road Initiative, which stretches as far as South Africa. Instead, the Chinese operator of South Africa’s single largest Special Economic Zone proposal – in rural Makhado – and his local allies suggested that solar power could supply energy for the $10 billion project, including high-emissions industrial projects. This raised the question of whether firms engaged in mining, smelting, processing and other carbon-intensive activities would pick ‘low-hanging fruits’ within the renewable energy sector (instead of that power going into the grid for broader consumption). Their incentive is to do so, in order to safeguard the so-called Minerals-Energy Complex from Western climate sanctions – threatened, on grounds of high CO2-inputs to export products including steel, aluminium and petrochemicals.

Two techniques associated with ecological modernisation – natural capital accounting and the Social Cost of Carbon – may prove relevant to civil society critics of ‘extractivism’, in shifting the narrative further across space, time and scale. © 2024 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Growth and democracy: Trade-offs and paradoxes,"The present paper attempts to reveal the relationships between some long-run systemic processes (on the economic, ecological, social and symbolic levels) and the theme of democracy. Starting from the distinction between democracy and autonomy, the paper focusses on its main issue: the trade-off between growth and autonomy. Continual growth can be produced, and indeed has been produced throughout history, only if accompanied by a loss of autonomy, even, beyond a certain scale threshold, to the detriment of representative democracy. While this conflict has never been rejected by political theorists, it has, in actual fact, been removed from all political debate.The second part of the paper seeks to individuate some of the long-run basic dynamics that characterise the global system: the analysis starts from the growth/accumulation/innovation process which characterized industrial capitalism, first, and financial capitalism, later, pointing out its self-pursuing, multi-scale, emergent nature with its main consequences for both . ecological and . social sustainability. The outcome of these processes, such as the loss of well-being, the increasing social and ecological costs and the growing fragmentation of the collective imaginary, in the long run leads the global system towards a condition of . non equilibrium, from which either scenarios of greater autonomy or fatal risks for democracy itself, may emerge. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental regulation and corporate policy,"The agricultural sector is coming under increasing scrutiny as to its contribution to environmental degradation. The concepts of corporate social responsibility and environmental and product liability suggest that agribusiness firms have a duty and are responsible not only for the environmental impacts of their production and distribution operations but in part for the environmental practices and impacts of those who use their products and from whom they acquire raw materials as well. More and more agribusiness firms are expected to develop environmentally responsible corporate policies that are substantiative in nature rather than simply public relations gestures. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Greening of European cities: Social benefits of urban nature for urban air quality,"While current climate and environmental efforts are mostly focused on the necessary and urgent CO2 emissions cuts, energy transition and climate adaptation, other not least pressing issues such as air quality start reaching the political agenda (European Commission, 2019). In this paper, we address air pollution from the social welfare perspective and bring together two strings of literature on the productivity of green urban infrastructure for ambient air quality and the monetisation of air quality improvements. Based on the EU air quality data by country and city, we identify those regions, which would benefit most from improved urban green infrastructure to improve air quality performance in Europe. We review a set of academic literature on the impact of urban green combating urban air pollution, and provide a synthesis review of social externality costs connected to urban air pollution. We extrapolate, in a stylized manner, the effect of increasing urban vegetation throughout the EU and in a selection of EU cities. Our estimates show that additional 1m2 of green cover throughout the EU cities would lead to 65,9 mln EUR of benefit per year, split about equally between the benefits of improved air quality and carbon sequestration, equivalent to 976 euros per ha per year for air pollutants and 1024 euros per ha per year for carbon abatement. © 2021, Czech Association for European Studies.

Multi-Decadal Soil Moisture and Crop Yield Variability—A Case Study With the Community Land Model (CLM5),"While the impacts of climate change on global food security have been studied extensively, the capability of emerging tools that couple land surface processes and crop growth in reproducing inter-annual yield variability at regional scale remains to be tested rigorously. In this study, we analyzed the effects of weather variations between years (1999–2019) on regional crop productivity for two agriculturally managed regions with contrasting climate and cropping conditions: the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (DE-NRW) and the Australian state of Victoria (AUS-VIC), using the latest version of the Community Land Model (CLM5) and the WFDE5 (WATCH Forcing Data methodology applied to ECMWF reanalysis version 5) reanalysis. Overall, the simulation results were able to reproduce the total annual crop yields of certain crops, while also capturing the differences in total yield magnitudes between the domains. However, the simulations showed limitations in correctly capturing inter-annual differences of crop yield compared to official yield records, which resulted in relatively low correlation coefficients between 0.07 and 0.39 in AUS-VIC and between 0.11 and 0.42 in DE-NRW. The mean absolute deviation of simulated winter wheat yields was up to 4.6 times lower compared to state-wide records from 1999 to 2019. Our results suggest the following limitations of CLM5: (a) limitations in simulating yield responses from plant hydraulic stress; (b) errors in simulating soil moisture contents compared to satellite-derived data; and (c) errors in the representation of cropland in general, for example, crop parameterizations and human influences. © 2024 The Author(s).

Pay-as-you-go social security in a changing environment,"In this paper, we examine the optimal pay-as-you-go social security scheme which reallocates resources across generations in a changing environment, that is, with fluctuations in population growth rates and in productivity levels. We use an overlapping generations model along with a social welfare function consisting of the sum of generational utilities either unweighted or weighted by population size and a discount factor. We show how intergenerational resource sharing can be used to improve social welfare even though the extent of intergenerational redistribution is hampered by payroll tax deadweight losses in the spirit of the optimal taxation literature. Also it appears that resource sharing is much more restricted in a closed economy that in an open economy, which is not subject to a national resource constraint at each period of time. © 1991, Springer-Verlag.

Mortality traps and the dynamics of health transitions,"An examination of life expectancy in 1963 reveals twin peaks in the empirical distribution across countries: one group of countries clustered around a life expectancy of 40 years and a second group clustered around a life expectancy of 65 years. By 2003, the mode of each cluster had moved up by ∼10 years. Although the two groups are similar in that within each of them, there is progress toward higher life expectancy, a number of countries appear to have made the jump from the high-mortality cluster to the low-mortality cluster. We reject the hypothesis that these changes reflect a simple convergence process. The data instead suggest continuous advances among many countries within clusters, with advances in life expectancy in some nations resulting in a jump from one cluster to the other. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring Perceptions on Climate Change Through the American Climate Metrics Survey, 2016-2019","This article compares perceptions of climate change between the U.S. public and National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) members collected from the annual American Climate Metrics Survey from 2016 to 2019. We analyzed the similarities, differences, and changes over 4 years regarding climate change beliefs and concerns, harms, benefits and costs of action, and solutions. While both groups had similar climate change concerns, NEHA members were significantly more likely than the public to recognize the harmful impact of climate change on health, prioritize climate action over economic growth, and act on climate solutions. NEHA members were also less likely to agree that the costs of acting on climate change are too high. We recommend that NEHA continue supporting the environmental public health workforce through education and training, facilitating cross-sectoral engagement between local partners and community members, and encouraging participation in programs such as NEHA’s Climate Health and Adaptation Mitigation Partnership (CHAMP) program and ecoAmerica’s Climate for Health Ambassador Training. Developing resources to help communities understand climate health threats and implement climate solutions is important for NEHA to support due to limited resources available for local environmental public health. Through continued partnerships and collaborations-such as our work with ecoAmerica and our engagement with the National Center for Environmental Health within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-NEHA will continue to build the capability and capacity of the workforce so they can be leaders in their jurisdiction’s local climate and health conversation. © 2024, National Environmental Health Association.

A review of Biofuels in India: Challenges and opportunities,"Economic development in India has raised millions of people out of poverty and brought about the modernization of society. Economic ambition though has not been reached without costs. India has become more reliant of imports of energy which affects energy security. Pollution from industry, transport and traditional cook stoves affects air quality and is increasing emissions of greenhouse gases and contributing to climate change. . India initiated bio-fuel production nearly a decade ago to reduce its dependence on imported oil and thus improve energy security and is now one of the largest producers of Jatropha oil. The country began 5% ethanol blending (E5) pilot program in 2001 and formulated the National Mission on Biodiesel in 2003 to achieve 20% biodiesel blends by 2011-2012 (Government of India, 2002, 2003). Similar to many countries around the world, India's biofuel programs experienced setbacks, primarily because of supply shortages and global concerns over food security. India's National Policy on Biofuels in 2009 proposed a non-mandatory target of a 20% blend for both biodiesel and ethanol by 2017, and outlines a broad strategy for the biofuels program and policy measures to be considered to support the program. The aim of the paper is to review the potential for biofuels to off-set the use of fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in India. The recent historic use of biofuels in the context of Government policy developments will be presented. Example materials (crops, wastes, residues) that can be used for biofuels will be reviewed taking a systems approach through whole lifecycle assessment. Case studies highlighting failure and successes with biofuel utilization will be presented as examples of the challenges and opportunities for the use of biofuels in India, with suggestions made on the role of biofuels in the future.",Not About Sufficiency
Steps to a sustainable Northern Australia,"Northern Australia's globally significant savannas and rivers face major threats, from cattle to weeds to land clearing to climate change. In the face of imperatives and pressures such as reducing carbon emissions, nature conservation, alleviating Indigenous disadvantage, the resources boom and global food security, how should development be managed to protect its globally significant ecosystems? Nine planks in a 'Sustainable Northern Australia' agenda are proposed: (i) enhance investment in mitigating pervasive landscape threats; (ii) strengthen support for Indigenous Caring for Country activities and incorporation of Traditional Ecological Knowledge into land management; (iii) align and strengthen invasive species control and management; (iv) facilitate new economic development pathways focused on sustainability; (v) build climate resilience by maintaining and enhancing landscape-scale connectivity; (vi) protect free-flowing rivers from dams and major water resource development; (vii) establish and effectively manage a large interconnected network of protected areas; (viii) develop cooperative governance arrangements; and (ix) enhance knowledge generation and research and monitoring capacity. © 2008 Ecological Society of Australia.",Not About Sufficiency
Strategic use of ecosystem services and co-benefits for Sustainable Development Goals,"Ecosystem services' (ES) assessments can inform sustainability policies but often translate poorly into practical decision-making due to their disconnection from local challenges. Problem framing is a crucial step in improving the operationalization of ecosystem studies. First, the study analyzes the challenges and opportunities for sustainability in three European outermost regions: the Canary Islands, French Guiana, and Reunion Island. Second, it proposes strategies to make use of ES assessments as a means to address these sustainability issues. We used a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis for strategic planning, extended with a PESTEL analysis, standing for Political, Economic, Socio-cultural, Technological, Environmental, Legal, and Regulatory. Semi-structured interviews (n = 38) were conducted to identify PESTEL factors facilitating or impeding sustainability in the case studies. Interviews were coded into PESTEL factors before being synthesized and reported into SWOT matrices. We suggest seven ESs implementation strategies addressing these challenges from these SWOT matrices. Finally, this paper highlights the potential contributions of ES-based strategies to achieving multiple United Nations' 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). On average, the strategies are expected to affect the delivery of six ESs. The suggested strategies are expected to contribute to the achievement of SDGs 15 (Life on Land), 2 (Zero Hunger), 14 (Life Below Water), and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). These results pinpoint the key factors to consider, through stakeholder consultation, when designing a practical ES study. © 2022 The Authors.

An assessment of future global water issues,"After decades of neglect, water has recently become a part of the international political agenda. However, the focus of the debate on the global water crisis is still wrong. The main crisis is unlikely to come from water scarcity, though some countries will find it difficult to manage such problems. Instead, it is likely to come from continuing and rapid water quality deterioration, and the availability of investment funds. Neither of these two issues is being adequately reflected in global water debates. In addition, the targets of the water-related Millennium Development Goals are unlikely to be achieved universally by 2015, until and unless consumers pay for the water services they receive. The subsidies should be very specifically targeted to the poor. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of third-party audits in ensuring producer compliance with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification system,"Certification systems for sustainable agricultural commodities typically rely on auditors to verify that producers comply with environmental, social, and legal standards. In the oil palm industry, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification system promises to address core sectoral sustainability concerns—including deforestation, fire, biodiversity loss, peatland drainage, forced labor, and land tenure conflict—by applying third-party audits to large-scale oil palm growers. Audits are designed to detect noncompliances with the standard, and to ensure that growers resolve these nonconformities. Yet, the role of RSPO audits in generating additionality across key sustainability issues remains unclear. Here, we compiled and analyzed data from a timeseries of annual audit reports for two-thirds of all certified oil palm growers in Indonesia as of December 2015 (n = 114 certified growers and 262 reports). We found that certified growers were required to address a median of four noncompliances per audit (range 0-37), with more noncompliances detected at initial certification than during subsequent audits. Certification demanded the most changes under our thematic areas of Waste & Pollution (9% of all noncompliances) and Employment (7%) and the least changes in Fire (<1%) and Corporate Social Responsibility programs (<1%). Thus, while many RSPO certified growers make real changes to achieve certification, these changes do not always address core sectoral performance concerns. Regression analysis indicated that RSPO member and certification body were significantly correlated with noncompliance frequency. This suggests that each member has a different cost of compliance and indicates heterogeneous stringency of standard application by certification bodies. We recommend that future research evaluate how post-2015 changes in RSPO assurance processes have interacted with a more robust and comprehensive certification standard to alter the additionality from third-party audits. © 2022 The Author(s).

"Climate Change, Food Supply, and Dietary Guidelines","Food production is affected by climate change, and, in turn, food production is responsible for 20-30% of greenhouse gases. The food system must increase output as the population increases and must meet nutrition and health needs while simultaneously assisting in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Good nutrition is important for combatting infection, reducing child mortality, and controlling obesity and chronic disease throughout the life course. Dietary guidelines provide advice for a healthy diet, and the main principles are now well established and compatible with sustainable development. Climate change will have a significant effect on food supply; however, with political commitment and substantial investment, projected improvements will be sufficient to provide food for the healthy diets needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Some changes will need to be made to food production, nutrient content will need monitoring, and more equitable distribution is required to meet the dietary guidelines. Increased breastfeeding rates will improve infant and adult health while helping to reduce greenhouse gases. © 2020 Annual Reviews Inc.. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
A physically-based model of long-term food demand,"Reducing hunger while staying within planetary boundaries of pollution, land use and fresh water use is one of the most urgent sustainable development goals. It is imperative to understand future food demand, the agricultural system, and the interactions with other natural and human systems. Studying such interactions in the long-term future is often done with Integrated Assessment Modelling. In this paper we develop a new food demand model to make projections several decades ahead, having 46 detailed food categories and population segmented by income and urban vs rural. The core of our model is a set of relationships between income and dietary patterns, with differences between regions and income inequalities within a region. Hereby we take a different, more long-term-oriented approach than elasticity-based macro-economic models (Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and Partial Equilibrium (PE) models). The physical and detailed nature of our model allows for fine-grained scenario exploration. We first apply the model to the newly developed Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, and then to additional sustainable development scenarios of food waste reduction and dietary change. We conclude that total demand for crops and grass could increase roughly 35–165% between 2010 and 2100, that this future demand growth can be tempered more effectively by replacing animal products than by reducing food waste, and that income-based consumption inequality persists and is a contributing factor to our estimate that 270 million people could still be undernourished in 2050. © 2017",Not About Sufficiency

Global Climate Change: Political Realism and the Case for a World Climate Bank,"The Paris Agreement’s goals cannot be achieved without sufficient funding, but the funding has been extremely inadequate. Addressing this problem innovatively, John Broome and Duncan Foley offer economic and political arguments in favor of establishing a new international institution, a World Climate Bank (WCB). The economic case for a WCB appears strong insofar as the bank’s main function would be to scale up mobilization of the financial resources needed for decarbonizing the world economy. However, Broome and Foley problematically assert that a WCB must buy up fossil fuel assets. I argue that this could lead to disastrous consequences and must be ruled out. Claims by Broome and Foley about realism play important roles in their proposal, although it is not clearly based on any particular form of realist political theory. I argue that a realistic proposal would include sound arguments, and I show that the political arguments offered by Broome and Foley involve equivocation, vagueness, and self-contradiction. I sketch a provisional political case for a World Climate Bank for Mitigation, Adaptation, and Resilience (WCB-MAR) satisfying certain desiderata. In the course of critiquing and revising the Broome-Foley proposal, I begin to develop a new conception of political realism. Here I aim to motivate political scientists and theorists focusing on international institutions and global justice to help develop and assess political responses to the climate crisis, including my proposal for a WCB-MAR. When doing such work, they should take full account of the gravity and urgency of the crisis. This requires them to be politically realistic in the sense discussed herein. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Water Balance Assessment for Water Management in Oil & Gas Operations: A Methodological Approach,"The Water Balance Assessment is a methodological approach developed and applied by Eni for the identification of improvements in water management at site level. The approach is based on three steps. The following report describes each step and the application of the approach to a real case study in Tunisia. Water is a vital resource for our planet and for humankind. Biodiversity and ecosystems' preservation, human health, and food security as well as energy production, industrial development and economic growth are all dependent on water. The consequences of climate change and the actual projections of increasing water demand will affect water availability and quality in the coming years. About the Oil & Gas sector, this industry consumes and produces significant volumes of water. For this reason, energy companies must consider sustainable options for the use of this resource, especially in water stress areas. This can be achieved through: • A deep knowledge of the site water streams and of the context where the site is located. • Identification of improvements and initiatives that could reduce the water risk of the site. About water safeguarding, Eni is committed to pursue the following practices: • Water Conservation: Upstream Oil & Gas operations need significant quantities of water; a key element for its conservation includes the reduction of withdrawals and the efficiency in water use. • Water Reuse and Valorization: Upstream Oil & Gas operations must manage large volumes of wastewater, mainly Produced Water. Design solutions shall introduce and maximize the recycle of water with the adoption of suitable treatments, to make discharges compatible with the reuse in the same production cycle or by third parties (e.g., other plants, local communities), and pursue the opportunity to reuse industrial water, instead of discharging it as wastewater. For their deployment, Eni has defined and applied a methodological approach to support the definition of improvement and optimization initiatives of water management at the site level. The approach represents an application of a ""convergence approach"" which, starting from an overall view of the site, identifies opportunities, further and more detailed areas of analysis, and design projects that can improve water use, management, and reuse. The methodological approach is based on the following steps: • A country-based framework study on water resources, and water-related risks analysis at country and local level. • A Water Balance Assessment, gathering water qualitative and quantitative information and site framework details. • Definition of site initiatives for wastewater reuse and valorization, and for the optimization of water withdrawals, based on the above steps and considering local legislation. Through this approach, operational water risks exposure is analyzed in detail, allowing to address a wide range of opportunities for the improvement of water management, also through the development of new synergies with local communities. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers",Not About Sufficiency
Understanding policy learning and change through policy beliefs: Florida smart growth,"This study analyzed policy learning and change in Florida 2007–2017 smart growth policy. Content analysis of legislation identified policy learning through three hierarchical policy belief systems, where a broad system constrained the narrower system. Social policy learning through broad deep core beliefs, covering principles of state’s environmental and natural resource protection, resulted in little learning and incremental pace. Legislation favoring protection was hard to change. Social policy learning through policy core beliefs, covering goals and strategies of state’s public health and economic growth facilities, generally lacked evidence of learning and change. Economic growth facilities nonetheless exhibited evidence of extensive and abrupt learning, followed by drastic policy change, due to economic recession conditions. These conditions also affected instrumental policy learning through narrow secondary beliefs, including implementation tools for local plan, local school/transportation facilities, and regional planning. Instrumental learning was extensive and incremental. Policy change supporting discretionary tools also was incremental. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency

Does primary stakeholder management improve competitiveness? A dynamic network non-parametric frontier approach,"This study examines whether positive primary stakeholder management is reflected in firm competitiveness. To conceptualize firm competitiveness, we follow a productivity perspective, in which technological and economic relationships between input consumption and output production are considered. Utilizing a three-stage dynamic network data envelopment analysis approach, we compute the Malmquist productivity index, which allows to examine the dynamics of the technology frontier and the levels of catch-up among a sample of international airlines observed between 2005 and 2019. We find that productivity, technological, and efficiency changes are enhanced by two dimensions of stakeholder management (i.e., employees and product/customer responsibility) that are socially required and capture economic and legal responsibilities. Dimensions of stakeholder management that are socially desired or expected (i.e., community, environment, and human rights) and are not directly related to operations or factors that create economic value, do not appear to play a significant role in improving airline productivity change. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Payments discourage coordination in ecosystem services provision: Evidence from behavioral experiments in Southeast Asia,"The contribution of synthetic pesticides to closing yield gaps around the world is undeniable; however, their use is also a classic double-edged sword. Beyond the well-recognized social costs (e.g., pollution to soil and water, and health effects both on consumers and other species) there are also private costs on farmers beyond the direct costs of inputs, associated with elevated risks of both acute and chronic damage to farmers' health, and with the destruction of populations of beneficial organisms. Managing agricultural land use to enhance natural pest control services (also called mobile agent-based ecosystem services or MABES) holds promise to reduce this growing reliance on pesticides, though it too carries costs. In particular, uncertainty in crop yield due to pest damages, as well as the need to coordinate pesticide use with neighboring farms, can be important obstacles to establishing the longer-term public good of natural pest regulation. Current thinking on promoting ecosystem services suggests that payments or other economic incentives are a good fit for the promotion of public good ecosystem services such as MABES. We undertook a framed field experiment to examine the role of subsidies for non-crop habitat in improving insect-based ecosystem services in two separate samples in Southeast Asia - Cambodia and Vietnam. Our central finding is that these two contexts are not poised equally to benefit from incentives promoting MABES, and in fact may be left worse off by payments schemes. As the study and practice of payments for ecosystem services programs grows, this finding provides an important qualifier on recent theory supporting the use of payments to promote public good ecosystem services - where the nature of the coordination problem is complex and nonlinear, farm systems can be made worse off by being encouraged to attempt it. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
The 2019 report of the MJA–Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: a turbulent year with mixed progress,"The MJA–Lancet Countdown on health and climate change was established in 2017 and produced its first Australian national assessment in 2018. It examined 41 indicators across five broad domains: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. It found that, overall, Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. In this report we present the 2019 update. We track progress on health and climate change in Australia across the same five broad domains and many of the same indicators as in 2018. A number of new indicators are introduced this year, including one focused on wildfire exposure, and another on engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector. Several of the previously reported indicators are not included this year, either due to their discontinuation by the parent project, the Lancet Countdown, or because insufficient new data were available for us to meaningfully provide an update to the indicator. In a year marked by an Australian federal election in which climate change featured prominently, we find mixed progress on health and climate change in this country. There has been progress in renewable energy generation, including substantial employment increases in this sector. There has also been some progress at state and local government level. However, there continues to be no engagement on health and climate change in the Australian federal Parliament, and Australia performs poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries; for example, it is one of the world's largest net exporters of coal and its electricity generation from low carbon sources is low. We also find significantly increasing exposure of Australians to heatwaves and, in most states and territories, continuing elevated suicide rates at higher temperatures. We conclude that Australia remains at significant risk of declines in health due to climate change, and that substantial and sustained national action is urgently required in order to prevent this. © 2019 AMPCo Pty Ltd",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptation to climate change: A review of challenges and tradeoffs in six areas,"Problem: Even if significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions are achieved, some amount of climate change appears to be inevitable. Local, regional, state, and federal planning and regulation should begin to address how to adapt to these changes. Purpose: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, using California as a case study. We examine the institutional and regulatory challenges and tradeoffs that climate change poses in six particularly vulnerable areas: water resources, electricity, coastal resources, air quality, public health, and ecosystem resources. We discuss obstacles to adaptation planning and successes overcoming these barriers, and suggest how planning can incorporate adaptation. Methods: This article presents a policy synthesis of adaptation planning issues, drawing on our recent research on California's experience and related literature. We summarize the results of six studies that draw on quantitative and qualitative information gathered through surveys, interviews, and literature review. Results and conclusions: Planners should use forward-looking climate data that include higher water and air temperatures, sea-level rise, and increased numbers of extreme events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires when making decisions about future development, infrastructure investments, open-space protection, and disaster preparedness. Climate change will exacerbate conflicts between goals for economic development, habitat protection, and public safety, requiring stronger interagency coordination and new laws and regulations. Takeaway for practice: Local and regional planners can help society adapt to a changing climate by using the best available science, deciding on goals and early actions, locating relevant partners, identifying and eliminating regulatory barriers, and encouraging the introduction of new state mandates and guidelines. © American Planning Association.",Not About Sufficiency
The role for scientists in tackling food insecurity and climate change,"To adapt to climate change and ensure food security, major interventions are required to transform current patterns and practices of food production, distribution and consumption. The scientific community has an essential role to play in informing concurrent, strategic investments to establish climate-resilient agricultural production systems, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, make efficient use of resources, develop low-waste supply chains, ensure adequate nutrition, encourage healthy eating choices and develop a global knowledge system for sustainability. This paper outlines scientific contributions that will be essential to the seven policy recommendations for achieving food security in the context of climate change put forward by the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change. These include improved understanding of agriculture's vulnerability to climate change, food price dynamics, food waste and consumption patterns and monitoring technologies as well as multidisciplinary investigation of regionally appropriate responses to climate change and food security challenges. © 2012 Beddington et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Energy audit and multi-criteria decision analysis to identify sustainable strategies in the university campuses: Application to politecnico di torino,"Universities play a headship role among entities that invest in technological progress and intend to increase education in sustainable culture towards a post-carbon society. With this in mind, Politecnico di Torino is a leader on the national and international scene. It has prepared sustainability lines for the next few years to translate the Sustainable Development Goals into concrete actions. The goal of this work is the evaluation of eight alternative energy efficiency scenarios resulting from the combination of different strategies for the retrofit of the University Campus of Politecnico di Torino. In the first part of the study, the alternatives are assessed in terms of energy performance. Subsequently, an economic evaluation supported by the multi-criteria TOPSIS method makes it possible to order the alternatives according to the opinion of several experts. The integrated evaluation allows considering a set of co-benefits generated by the project going behind the energy aspects. The best strategy involves covering electricity needs with renewable energy sources, adopting students’ engagement policies and optimizing the set-point temperature.

The study provides a four-decade spatio-temporal model of urban Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes in Akure between the years 1984 and 2023 from acquired Landsat satellite imageries. The result shows more than 20% net change increase in developed LULC classes between the study years. A strong positive correlation exists between the years covered in the analyses and urban development (r = 0.93, p = 0.002), and a strong negative relationship with the forest land use (r = −0.94, p = 0.002) with potential debilitating impacts on residents’ health, green infrastructures and the city’s sustainability in the future. Furthermore, results of key informant interviews (KIIs) of officials of the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development (MPPUD) in Akure, Ondo State, unveil various views on the “place of health” in urban planning practices in Akure. A lack of synergy between urban planners and public health practitioners in the city and limiting scope of functions of urban planning on the impact of health in Akure were observed. Thus, we recommend the integration of a sustainable urban planning approach as a guide to manage the city. Copyright © 2024 Bayode and Siegmund.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimizing industrial and domestic water consumption efficiency for sustainable growth through data envelopment analysis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Water resources are essential for socioeconomic development and quality of life, but limited availability, especially in regions with uneven distribution, poses challenges. The rapid economic development in Catalonia has led to considerable stress related to water scarcity, emphasizing the urgent requirement for improved resource management practices. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate the existing water resource consumption efficiency in key sectors across Catalonia and suggest workable strategies for water management to ensure sustainability. METHODS: The water resource consumption efficiency of 42 Catalan regions in 2021 was analyzed using 50 data envelopment analysis models, employing both constant and variable returns to scale. Information regarding gross domestic product and water usage was sourced from regional governmental sources. The analysis utilized both input and output-oriented models to pinpoint areas where efficiency could be enhanced. FINDINGS: The findings indicated that the industrial sector in Barcelona reached peak efficiency in water resource utilization, earning a score of 1 in both models, which sets a new benchmark. Ribera d’Ebre reached full efficiency in domestic water consumption with a score of 1. Conversely, regions such as Priorat, Terra Alta, and Barcelona showed inefficiencies, suggesting that to achieve full efficiency, Priorat, Terra Alta, and Barcelona could reduce inputs by approximately 63 percent, 44 percent, and 26 percent, respectively, or increase outputs by approximately 172 percent, 78 percent, and 36 percent respectively, holding other factors constant. CONCLUSION: Focusing on efficiency enhancements in areas that currently score lower can greatly aid in achieving sustainable water management practices in Catalonia. Embracing proven methods from exemplary regions has the potential to strengthen water resource management, contributing to both economic resilience and environmental sustainability. © 2025 The author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Multi-Actors' Co-Implementation of Climate-Smart Village Approach in West Africa: Achievements and Lessons Learnt,"Climate change and variability are significant challenges for the environment and food security worldwide. Development strategies focusing simultaneously on adaptive farming, productivity, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-known as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) strategies-are key to responding to these challenges. For almost a decade, within the framework of Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), World Agroforestry (ICRAF), and its partners have been using Participatory Action Research (PAR) to fully engage key stakeholders in co-creating such CSA development strategies. This includes the testing of Agricultural Research for Development (AR4D) CSA scalability options. The multidisciplinary teams include the National Research and Extension Systems (NARES), national meteorological services (NMS), non-profit organizations (NGOs), and local radio programs, among others. The CCAFS-West Africa Program, World Agroforestry-West and Central Africa (ICRAF-WCA), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), University of Reading, and Centre Régional de Formation et d'Application en Agro-météorologie et Hydrologie Opérationnelle (AGRHYMET) provide technical backstopping to the national teams. Climate information (CI) was used as an entry point to inform the development of CSA technologies and practices within Climate-Smart Villages (CSV). This groundwork has led to a greater understanding of three critical factors for successful CSV implementation: (1) Building strong partnerships to co-design and develop agricultural systems that improve ecosystem and population resilience, (2) Key stakeholders (researchers, farmers, development agents, and students) capacity strengthening through vocational and academic training, and (3) Using CI for livelihood planning at all scales. These three factors support more effective identification and testing of agricultural technologies and practices addressing climate variability and change at plot, community, and landscape levels. This paper discusses the PAR-CSA methodology and parameters for evaluation, including biophysical and social change. Keys to success, including communication, knowledge sharing tools, and scalability are also discussed. Finally, future opportunities for improvement are presented, including knowledge product development, CSA policy and investment planning, capacity building, further engagement of the private sector, and additional research on existing practices and tools. © Copyright © 2021 Bayala, Ky-Dembele, Dayamba, Somda, Ouédraogo, Diakite, Chabi, Alhassane, Bationo, Buah, Sanogo, Tougiani, Traore, Zougmoré and Rosenstock.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of cities in reducing the cardiovascular impacts of environmental pollution in low- And middle-income countries,"Background: As low- and middle-income countries urbanize and industrialize, they must also cope with pollution emitted from diverse sources. Main text: Strong and consistent evidence associates exposure to air pollution and lead with increased risk of cardiovascular disease occurrence and death. Further, increasing evidence, mostly from high-income countries, indicates that exposure to noise and to both high and low temperatures may also increase cardiovascular risk. There is considerably less research on the cardiovascular impacts of environmental conditions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the levels of pollution are often higher and the types and sources of pollution markedly different from those in higher-income settings. However, as such evidence gathers, actions to reduce exposures to pollution in low- and middle-income countries are warranted, not least because such exposures are very high. Cities, where pollution, populations, and other cardiovascular risk factors are most concentrated, may be best suited to reduce the cardiovascular burden in LMICs by applying environmental standards and policies to mitigate pollution and by implementing interventions that target the most vulnerable. The physical environment of cities can be improved though municipal processes, including infrastructure development, energy and transportation planning, and public health actions. Local regulations can incentivize or inhibit the polluting behaviors of industries and individuals. Environmental monitoring can be combined with public health warning systems and publicly available exposure maps to inform residents of environmental hazards and encourage the adoption of pollution-avoiding behaviors. Targeted individual or neighborhood interventions that identify and treat high-risk populations (e.g., lead mitigation, portable air cleaners, and preventative medications) can also be leveraged in the very near term. Research will play a key role in evaluating whether these approaches achieve their intended benefits, and whether these benefits reach the most vulnerable. Conclusion: Cities in LMICs can play a defining role in global health and cardiovascular disease prevention in the next several decades, as they are well poised to develop innovative, multisectoral approaches to pollution mitigation, while also protecting the most vulnerable. © 2020 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Organizing for good—using organization design to take on grand challenges,"Over the past decade, scholarly work has surged around grand societal challenges, such as climate change, public health, and poverty, often framed by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These complex and global issues demand innovative organization design solutions. The “Organizing for Good” campaign, launched by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the Organizational Design Community (ODC), aims to spotlight, curate, and stimulate research and practices contributing to the SDGs. This introductory essay serves as a prologue to a special issue in the Journal of Organization Design, which closely aligned with the campaign’s objectives. It delves into the concept of organization design as a tool for addressing these challenges, viewing organization designs as problem-solving systems for collective action. Furthermore, it provides an overview of how the SDGs intersect with the scholarly community focusing on organization design, previews the content of articles featured in this special issue, and raises questions for future research. © 2024, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Aquaculture and Ecosystem Services: Reframing the Environmental and Social Debate,"This chapter reframes the debate over the environmental and social impacts of different forms of aquaculture. It illustrates how the impacts flowing from the outputs of aquaculture operations can be mapped onto a well-known ecosystem service typology. It is argued that this will facilitate the analysis of: (1) the social, environmental and financial impacts of particular aquaculture operations, (2) the trade-offs between them, and (3) the sustainability of those trade-offs. The relevance and complementary nature of life-cycle assessment (LCA) to this approach is also discussed. For the purpose of presenting case studies, this chapter uses the ecosystem service typology that was assembled for The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) project. The first pair of case studies presented in the chapter demonstrates this through a discussion of two contrasting inland production systems, while the second pair does so through a discussion of two contrasting marine-based production systems. © John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Shared Socio-Economic Pathways of the Energy Sector – Quantifying the Narratives,"Energy is crucial for supporting basic human needs, development and well-being. The future evolution of the scale and character of the energy system will be fundamentally shaped by socioeconomic conditions and drivers, available energy resources, technologies of energy supply and transformation, and end-use energy demand. However, because energy-related activities are significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental and social externalities, energy system development will also be influenced by social acceptance and strategic policy choices. All of these uncertainties have important implications for many aspects of economic and environmental sustainability, and climate change in particular. In the Shared-Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) framework these uncertainties are structured into five narratives, arranged according to the challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation. In this study we explore future energy sector developments across the five SSPs using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), and we also provide summary output and analysis for selected scenarios of global emissions mitigation policies. The mitigation challenge strongly corresponds with global baseline energy sector growth over the 21st century, which varies between 40% and 230% depending on final energy consumer behavior, technological improvements, resource availability and policies. The future baseline CO2-emission range is even larger, as the most energy-intensive SSP also incorporates a comparatively high share of carbon-intensive fossil fuels, and vice versa. Inter-regional disparities in the SSPs are consistent with the underlying socioeconomic assumptions; these differences are particularly strong in the SSPs with large adaptation challenges, which have little inter-regional convergence in long-term income and final energy demand levels. The scenarios presented do not include feedbacks of climate change on energy sector development. The energy sector SSPs with and without emissions mitigation policies are introduced and analyzed here in order to contribute to future research in climate sciences, mitigation analysis, and studies on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. © 2016 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"An analytical study on municipal wastewater to energy generation, current trends, and future prospects in South Asian developing countries (an update on Pakistan scenario)","The water scarcity and energy crises are major challenges, particularly for South Asian developing countries. Wastewater resource recovery always remained an untapped potential for South Asian countries, especially in Pakistan. Globally, municipal wastewater’s global generation rate is about 331 km3/year; only a small proportion is treated and safely reused. Wastewater also has high energy content and can be greatly productive, whereas most of the wastewater treatment plants currently employed in developing regions are non-functional or taking high energy inputs. Many global level studies are being conducted for energy use reduction and the production of renewable energy from wastewater. In this review, installation of wastewater treatment plants is suggested in the context of economic and environmental feasibility for South Asian developing countries. Multiple factors showed the need for and high potential to installation of wastewater treatment plants for providing clean water under sustainable development goals and further to recover valuable contents from municipal wastewater. The tremendous need for infrastructure development became obvious to deliver clean water to communities that are using wastewater directly or indirectly for various purposes. Based on technical grounds, economic, social, and environmental challenges can be tackled with viable wastewater treatment plant design options in each country context. With each step of wastewater treatment, control strategies would minimize energy use and enhanced resource recovery will reduce pressure on the current natural resource base. Overall, the cost assessment, funding opportunities, research and development, and social acceptability remained the big factors to energy generation from municipal wastewater in South Asia.

Dust storms are an indication of an unhealthy environment in East Asia,"Dust storms frequently occur in Mongolia and in northern China. Each year there are 30 to 120 dusty days in source regions of Mongolia and 14-20 dusty days on the Korean Peninsula. Intense sand storms and associated dust falls produce environmental impacts in East Asia. This paper discusses the environmental degradation in Mongolia and the social, economic and atmospheric impacts of dust storms in the sink area. The impact of dust storms on environmental compartments as well as their direct and indirect consequences to basic resources like water and energy demand and supply is explained. Governments are encouraged to take appropriate action in specified regions. For monitoring dust storms there is a need for international cooperation to combat growing environmental and human security concerns. © Springer 2006.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability Versus Local Management: Comparative Performance of Rural Water Supply Schemes,"Since the late 1990s, India has been adopting a demand-driven approach to the provision of drinking water supplies in rural areas. The approach has produced significant results in terms of coverage of the habitations and villages by decentralized water supply schemes; this seems to have come at a cost to the community in terms of techno-institutional models chosen for water supply. Most of the schemes preferred by the communities are groundwater-based. The availability of water during summer months still remains a problem in these schemes, especially in the areas underlain by hard rocks. This chapter, through a case study on the rural water supply schemes in Maharashtra, analyses whether the policy of promoting local community management can actually produce the desired results of improved scheme performance. The findings of the study also lead us to the type of techno-institutional model that may work better in hard rock areas from the resource sustainability point of view. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
"Economic, social, and environmental sustainability in development theory and urban planning practice","In ten years, more than half the world's population will be living in cities. The United Nations (UN) has stated that this will threaten cities with social conflict, environmental degradation and the collapse of basic services. The economic, social, and environmental planning practices of societies embodying 'urban sustainability' have been proposed as antidotes to these negative urban trends. 'Urban sustainability' is a doctrine with diverse origins. The author believes that the alternative models of cultural development in Curitiba, Brazil, Kerala, India, and Nayarit, Mexico embody the integration and interlinkage of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Curitiba has become a more livable city by building an efficient intra-urban bus system, expanding urban green space, and meeting the basic needs of the urban poor. Kerala has attained social harmony by emphasizing equitable resource distribution rather than consumption, by restraining reproduction, and by attacking divisions of race, caste, religion, and gender. Nayarit has sought to balance development with the environment by framing a nature-friendly development plan that protects natural systems from urban development and that involves the public in the development process. A detailed examination of these alternative cultural development models reveals a myriad of possible means by which economic, social, and environmental sustainability might be advanced in practice. The author concludes that while these examples from the developing world cannot be directly translated to cities in the developed world, they do indicate in a general sense the imaginative policies that any society must foster if it is to achieve 'urban sustainability'.",Not About Sufficiency
Smallholders and small-scale agriculture: Mapping and visualization of knowledge domains and research trends,"In research literature, the terms “small-scale-agriculture” and “smallholder-agriculture” (farming) cannot be clearly distinguished and are frequently used synonymously. Taking terminology of both versions, we examine relationships between textual and bibliographic elements, identify clusters of studies and research accents, as well as developments in time. Using information science methods (big data, bibliometrics/scientometrics, visualization program Vosviewer) in the citation database Scopus, we design Boolean search statement/query (emphasis on proximity operators), analyse terms in titles and abstracts of articles, evaluate author networks (countries, co-authorship), keywords, and links between journals. Authors from developed and developing countries collaborate widely, with the US having the most co-authored articles, Germany having the most diverse current network, and Kenya being the strongest contributor among developing countries. Most articles are published by authors from Africa. There are also two smaller clusters representing Asia and the Americas. Three clusters of research priorities are evident: 1) crop production (current focus: crop yield), 2) livestock production (current focus: diseases), and 3) environmental issues, vulnerability to climate change, sustainability, and socio-economic themes. Future trends (hot topics and research fronts) will increasingly focus on adaptation strategies, food security, gender (women), or human health (at the time of submission, there were already dozens of papers on Covid 19 and smallholder farmers). Many topics that used to be most covered by Agricultural and Biological Sciences (Scopus Subject Area) are now increasingly covered in Social Sciences journals, becoming a complex research field on its own, which should translate into support and funding for such studies. © 2023 The Author(s).

Toward the full implementation of the water-energy-food nexus in computable general equilibrium modelling: methods and macroeconomic implications,"This paper contributes to the advancement of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling in addressing the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus. As such, it introduces water resources as a production factor for both the energy sector and irrigated agriculture, as well as their competition for the endowment, aiming to explicitly represent additional components of the WEF with respect to a standard CGE in the literature. Thus, it develops different modelling structures by computing impacts on regional GDP, sectorial prices, and production outputs in response to hypothetical water scarcity scenarios. This analysis allows for the determination of the role of data and modelling assumptions, such as production function, water substitutability with other endowments, water mobility across sectors, and sectorial water intensity, in influencing the results. Finally, the paper develops a dynamic scenario analysis, showing that an enhanced representation of the Nexus can significantly affect the macroeconomic dynamics of the simulations and their regional implications. © 2024 The International Input--Output Association.",Not About Sufficiency
Consequences of human conflicts on aquatic ecosystems in drylands areas: Future management perspective,"Aquatic ecosystems in dryland regions are among the most vulnerable globally, facing escalating threats from climate change, population growth, and human conflicts. Historically, water disputes have been a significant driver of tension. Over the past three decades, at least 59 water-related conflicts have occurred in drylands, predominantly in Asia and Africa, with approximately 50 % of these conflicts directly linked to water scarcity. The primary ecological consequences include the loss of hydrological connectivity, declining biodiversity, heightened water scarcity and pollution, and the degradation of physical habitats. The lack of conservation efforts during and after conflicts further destabilizes these fragile aquatic ecosystems, eroding their resilience. Such environmental disruptions reduce water availability and quality and pose serious risks to human health, food security, and socioeconomic stability. Moreover, the destruction of water infrastructure and ecosystem degradation caused by conflicts undermine progress toward achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to clean water, health, and biodiversity conservation. Addressing these challenges necessitates enhanced transboundary water governance, robust climate adaptation strategies, and the development of international legal frameworks to mitigate the long-term ecological impacts of human conflicts in dryland regions. This review explores the direct and indirect environmental effects of human conflicts on aquatic ecosystems in drylands, supported by critical case studies that underscore the urgency of these issues. © 2025",Not About Sufficiency
Single irrigation at the four-leaf stage in the spring optimizes winter wheat water consumption characteristics and water use efficiency,"Water scarcity is a key constraint to crop production in North China Plain (NCP), which produces the majority of the country’s winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The objective of this three-year field study was to see whether and when irrigation one-time in spring improved grain productivity and water use efficiency. Four sets of irrigation were established at the 3-leaf visible stage (L3) and the L4, L5, and L6 stages. When irrigation time was postponed, the spike number, 1000-grain weight, and water consumption increased progressively, whereas grain yield, grain number, dry matter, harvest, and WUE grew, then dropped, and peaked at L4. The increased grain number can be attributed to the L4's higher daily water consumption and water consumption percentage throughout the jointing-anthesis stages compared to the L3, L5, and L6. The cumulative (37 days), whereas it was longer in L3, L5, and L6(40, 42, and 43 days, respectively). Furthermore, flag leaf senescence was postponed in L4 with a higher post-anthesis leaf area index, photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, higher superoxide dismutase activity, and lower malondialdehyde concentration. As a result, single irrigation at the 4-leaf visible stage optimized water deficit and consumption before and after anthesis, resulting in higher yield and WUE in the NCP. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Building Sustainable Urban Futures: The Crucial Role of Urban Food Policy,"Urban Food Policies are valuable instruments that cities use to address the multidimensional challenges of food security, food safety and sustainability in urban contexts. As urbanisation continues, these policies offer targeted solutions, involving coordinated efforts by city governments, civil society and stakeholders, and promoting local sustainability and resilience. They are implemented in four types, including substantive (e.g. schools’ canteens and food hubs), regulative (e.g. food safety and hygiene standards on street vendors), fiscal (e.g. tax on sugary beverages), and informative interventions (e.g. campaigns promoting sustainable food practices). As cities expand, they face important issues, such as food access disparities, rising malnutrition, environmental degradation and food waste accumulation. Urban Food Policies can go beyond traditional national policies, incorporating targeted interventions that address and account for the specific issues of urban life. The main key objectives are: ensuring food security and safety, preserving biodiversity and reducing pollution in urban and peri-urban food systems, food waste management, healthy and sustainable diets, safeguarding cultural identity. However, their effectiveness depends on robust multi-level governance, collaboration and political will, targeting the local objectives in line with Sustainable Development Goals. Urban Food Policies’ contribution can enable cities to address current and future food-related challenges in a holistic way. © 2025 Agricultural Economics Society and European Association of Agricultural Economists.",Not About Sufficiency
"Population, public health and the environment in China","Increased industrialization and urbanization in the PRC have been accompanied by rising ambient air pollution and increasing water pollution. Resulting public health effects are complex and not well documented. Respiratory diseases were a major cause of illness and deaths in the 1970s, prior to the escalated economic, industrial, and urban growth of the reform period. There has been some reduction in respiratory disease mortality. While pneumonia deaths have declined in the last two decades, death rates from pollution-related respiratory diseases may have risen. It is still true that the death rate from respiratory diseases is 65 per cent higher in rural than urban areas, and far higher in very poor rural counties than in comparatively well-off rural counties. This suggests that continuing poverty and indoor air pollution are maintaining the high respiratory disease mortality in less advanced rural areas. In cities and prosperous rural areas, some reduction in indoor air pollution may be counteracted by rising ambient air pollution and increased tobacco smoking. Pollution of rivers and lakes has reportedly increased in the economic reform period. Industrial effluents rose alarmingly during the 1980s, but a concerted effort to treat industrial wastewater has been partially successful. Meanwhile, the dumping of untreated urban sewage into water bodies has escalated, so far without abatement. The feared increase in waterborne disease morbidity and mortality has not materialized - at least it is not evident in the available data. Rather, national policies of improving rural and urban water supplies and promoting food safety and hygiene have apparently succeeded in reducing illness and mortality from digestive and intestinal infectious diseases. China's compulsory fertility control policy has reduced population growth to an unusually low level. Given the rapidly growing economy, growth of population is not causing grave problems for China today. In the future, it is likely that population growth will be slow enough and economic growth brisk enough to continue this manageable situation. The public health situation in China has improved dramatically since 1949, and also since the beginning of the economic reforms. Survival chances have risen greatly for both sexes at most ages. Environmental threats to health have lessened enough to allow remarkable reductions in child mortality. Though considerable environmental hazards remain and cause continuing ill health, the main causes of death today in China are chronic diseases. China has only begun to address the prevention and cure of these health problems.",Not About Sufficiency
Adaptation strategies to combat climate change effect on rice and mustard in Eastern India,"The negative impact of climate change on crop production is alarming as the demand for food is expected to increase in coming years, at a rate of about 2 percent a year. Wet season rice (Oryza sativa) followed by mustard (Brassica juncea) is one of the prominent cropping sequences in Eastern India. Descreases in their productivity due to climate change will not only hamper the regional food security but also affect the global economy. Considering the fact, the present study aims to assess the impact of climate change on productivity of wet-season rice and mustard and to evaluate the effectiveness of agronomic adjustment as adaptation options. Crop growth simulation model (CGSM) is a very effective tool to predict the growth and yield of a crop. One CGSM, namely InfoCrop (Generic Crop Model), was calibrated and validated for the said crops for West Bengal State, Eastern India. After validation, the model was used to predict the yield under elevated thermal condition (1 and 3 °C rise over normal temperature). Moreover, the future weather situation as predicted by PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies) model was used as weather input of the CGSM and the yield was predicted for ten selected locations of West Bengal for the year 2025 and 2050. It was observed that the average yield reduction of the wet-season rice would be in the tune of about 20.0 % for 2025 and 27.8 % for 2050. The mustard yield of West Bengal may be reduced by 20.0 to 33.9 % for the year 2025 and up to 40 % for 2050. It was concluded that the negative impact of climate change on mustard grown in winter season will be more pronounced compared to wet-season rice. Adjustment of sowing time will be the simplest and effective adaptation option for both rice and mustard. Increased rate of nutrient application can sustain the rice yield under future climate. The older seedling at the time of transplanting of wet-season rice and increased seed rate of mustard were proved less effective. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Not About Sufficiency
GWAS identifies genetic loci underlying nitrogen responsiveness in the climate resilient C4 model Setaria italica (L.),"Introduction: N responsiveness is the capacity to perceive and induce morpho-physiological adaptation to external and internal Nitrogen (N). Crop productivity is propelled by N fertilizer and requires the breeding/selection of cultivars with intrinsically high N responsiveness. This trait has many advantages in being more meaningful in commercial/environmental context, facilitating in-season N management and not being inversely correlated with N availability over processes regulating NUE. Current lack of its understanding at the physio-genetic basis is an impediment to select for cultivars with a predictably high N response. Objectives: To dissect physio-genetic basis of N responsiveness in 142 diverse population of foxtail millet, Setaria italica (L.) by employing contrasting N fertilizer nutrition regimes. Methods: We phenotyped S. italica accessions for major yield related traits under low (N10, N25) and optimal (N100) growth conditions and genotyped them to subsequently perform a genome-wide association study to identify genetic loci associated with nitrogen responsiveness trait. Groups of accessions showing contrasting trait performance and allelic forms of specific linked genetic loci (showing haplotypes) were further accessed for N dependent transcript abundances of their proximal genes. Results: Our study show that N dependent yield rise in S. italica is driven by grain number whose responsiveness to N availability is genetically underlined. We identify 22 unique SNP loci strongly associated with this trait out of which six exhibit haplotypes and consistent allelic variation between lines with contrasting N dependent grain number response and panicle architectures. Furthermore, differential transcript abundances of specific genes proximally linked to these SNPs in same lines is indicative of their N dependence in a genotype specific manner. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the value/ potential of N responsiveness as a selection trait and identifies key genetic components underlying the trait in S. italica. This has major implications for improving crop N sustainability and food security. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency
"Geothermal energy prospect for decarbonization, EWF nexus and energy poverty mitigation in East Africa; the role of hydrogen production","The affordability and availability of water and energy have a huge impact on food production. Research has shown that there exists a direct and indirect link between power production and clean water generation. Hence the inclusion/importance given to the energy-water-food (EWF) nexus in the United Nations' sustainable development goals. Acknowledging the importance of decarbonization to the global future, there exists a gap in literature on the development of models that can enhance the EWF nexus, reduce energy poverty, and achieve 100% renewable energy in the electricity sector. Therefore, the technical and economic prospect of geothermal energy for bridging the aforementioned gaps in existing works of literature is presented in this study. The energy poverty/wealthy status of a country has been confirmed to have a significant impact on economic development, as economic development is largely reflected in the food-water availability. Ditto, this study is focused on the interconnectivity of the EWF nexus while incorporating global decarbonization targets. Geothermal energy is of the utmost significance in East Africa due to its abundant potential and distinctive geological features. Located in the Great Rift Valley, the region has an abundance of geothermal reservoirs, making it an ideal location for geothermal power generation. This study is novel as a comprehensive assessment framework for energy poverty is developed and innovative models utilizing primarily the geothermal resource in the East African region to mitigate this problem are proposed and analyzed. The role of hydrogen generation from critical excess electricity production is also analyzed. The East Africa region is considered the case study for implementing the models developed. A central renewable energy grid is proposed/modelled to meet the energy demand for seven East African countries namely; Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Djibouti, Comoros, Eritrea, and Rwanda. This study considers 2030, 2040, and 2050 as the timestamp for the implementation of the proposed models. The hybrid mix of the biomass power plant, solar photovoltaic (PV), pumped hydro storage system and onshore wind power is considered to furthermore show the potency of renewable energy resources in this region. Results showed that the use of geothermal energy to meet energy demands in the case study will mitigate energy poverty and enhance the region's EWF. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency

Global food security in 2050: The role of agricultural productivity and climate change,"In this paper, we examine how the complexities introduced by trends in agricultural productivity and climate change affect the future of global food security. We use a partial equilibrium model of global agriculture incorporating a food security module that links changes in the average dietary energy intake to shifts in the full caloric distribution, allowing us to compute changes in the incidence, headcount and average depth of malnutrition. After validating the model against an historical period, we implement a series of future scenarios to understand the impacts of key exogenous drivers on selected food security outcomes. Our results show improvements in global food security for the period 2006-2050. Despite growing population and increased biofuel demand, baseline income growth, coupled with projected increases in agricultural productivity lead to a 24 per cent rise in global average dietary energy intake. Consequently, the incidence of malnutrition falls by 84 per cent, lifting more than half a billion people out of extreme hunger. However, these results hinge heavily on agricultural productivity growth. Without such growth, there could be a substantial setback on food security improvements. Climate change adds uncertainty to these projections, depending critically on the crop yield impacts of increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. © 2014 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Biomass Smoke and Health Risks-The Situation in Developing Countries,"About half of the world's population relies on traditional fuels such as biomass (wood, agricultural residues, animal dung and charcoal) as the primary source of domestic energy. Nearly 2×109 kg of biomass is burnt every day in developing countries. Use of open fires for cooking and heating exposes an estimated 2 billion people to enhanced concentrations of particulate matter and gases, up to 10-20 times higher than ambient concentrations. Recent studies estimate that exposure to indoor air pollution associated with household solid fuel use may be responsible for nearly 1.6 million excess deaths in developing countries and about 2.6% of the global burden of disease. An understanding of the linkages between household fuel use and human health is especially crucial for developing strategies to improve household environments and the status of public health as they form an important prerequisite for all subsequent economic development. This chapter is devoted to describing the sources, emissions and patterns of exposure and consequent health risks for biomass smoke associated with household fuel use in developing country settings. Potential research needs in exposure and health risk assessments for addressing indoor air pollution and household energy issues within the mainstream of environmental health and public health policies of the region are also described. © 2004 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Not About Sufficiency
Bangladesh Delta Plan: Anatomy of a Long-Term Development Strategy,"The Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 is formulated with a target of achieving a safer, secured, resilient and prosperous country by the end of the twenty-first century.

However, the delta plan has missed certain issues that are critical for the sustainable development of the delta. This paper, therefore, offers recommendations for consideration as there are scopes to explore these issues being the delta plan is adaptive in nature. Our recommendation ranges from education and research; from exploring the potential of the blue economy to trans-boundary cooperation for water and energy security; from ensuring food security to food-quality security, water and air quality security and public health; from ensuring credibility of the government institutions to providing a national database with comprehensive household information suitable to enable effective policy intervention during shocks, disasters and pandemic like Covid-19 situation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
A new leadership amidst Japan’s ongoing energy transition,"With Japan’s thrust towards a more balanced energy mix, it has been undergoing what can be termed as an energy transition. While the Fukushima Disaster has played a crucial role in this transition, the Paris Agreement has further acted as an impetus for the same. However, since 2012 Japan was under the political leadership of Shinzo Abe, who today is the longest-serving Prime Minister of Japan until Yoshihide Suga took over the prime ministership recently. Under Abe’s guidance, Japan’s energy policy has been a mixed bag with a few hits and some major misses. Now, as Japan welcomes its new Prime Minister Suga, it falls upon him to lead Japan on a path of just transition. One which balances its energy and economic goals and pays heed to the necessity of building a climate-friendly sustainable model. This paper maps and evaluates the Abe administration’s broad energy policy measures and attempts to foresee the changes Suga administration can introduce to the ongoing energy transition of Japan. It also highlights the areas within the energy sector, which might require the focus of PM Suga to enable Japan to take advantage of the opportunity of making Japan a part of global green leadership. © 2021 Australian Institute of International Affairs.",Not About Sufficiency
"Baseline review and ecosystem services assessment of the Tana River Basin, Kenya","Ecosystem services are commonly defined as the benefits received by humanity via functioning ecosystems. They can be broadly categorized as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and habitat services; with many services co-occurring and most ecosystems providing a wide range of services across several categories. Water mediates many ecosystem services and is in turn heavily influenced by land management decisions made at different scales from local to basin. Taking a holistic ecosystem services approach that focuses on maintaining healthy ecosystems as primary mechanisms for ensuring sustainable services delivery has been slowly mainstreamed into land management decision making worldwide. In addition, it is now often an important guiding principle in research for development programs. In many water-rich basins found in less developed countries, efforts are under way to increase energy resources via hydropower production as well as expand irrigation potential to increase food security. However, climate change threatens to undermine these goals - meant to spur development and alleviate poverty - by imposing risks and requiring decision makers to act under significant levels of uncertainty. Within Kenya, the Tana River Basin serves as an example where there are significant development targets for hydropower, domestic water provision, and irrigation; planned as part of Kenya's 2030 Vision. Currently, the basin supplies Nairobi with hydropower and nearly all of its domestic water resources through a series of water transfers and dams in the Upper Tana Basin. Historically, authorities have struggled to develop sustainable large-scale irrigation projects in the middle and lower basin, while the upper basin continues to be one of the most agriculturally productive regions within the country. Both hydropower production and irrigation expansion have been plagued by controversy with historical efforts leading to relocations and increased conflict. At present, the country is working to balance its need for water, energy, and food security with the preservation of ecosystems and ensuring the sustainability of the services they provide. The basin is home to two major biodiversity hot spots. At its headwaters, the Kenyan government actively manages the Afromontane forests of the Aberdare Mountain Range, which serves as one of Kenya's five main water towers by ensuring water quantity and quality of the waters supplied to downstream users. At the terminus of the Tana River, lies its rich delta providing numerous livelihood opportunities as well as supporting several endemic and endangered plant and animal species. There are critical concerns regarding how hydropower and irrigation development may affect this rich delta. In addition, alarms have been raised regarding how upstream land management practices may have deleterious effects on current and planned built infrastructure (e.g., hydropower and large-scale irrigation) in the basin. Under the WISE-UP to Climate project, natural infrastructure is explored as a 'nature-based solution' for climate change adaptation and sustainable development. The project is developing knowledge on how to use portfolios of built water infrastructure (e.g., dams, levees, and irrigation channels) and natural infrastructure (e.g., wetlands, floodplains, and watersheds) in tandem for poverty reduction, water-energy-food security, biodiversity conservation, and climate resilience. This paper presents a basin-scale summary of natural resources within the Tana River Basin and illustrates an overview of how people living within the basin rely on a wide variety of ecosystem services. In addition, the paper puts forth a first approximation of the key role natural infrastructure plays in supporting efforts to ensure water-energy-food security in the Tana River Basin. © 2012, by IWMI.",Not About Sufficiency
Feeding the future,"David Baines and Paul Fray shared their views on growing crisis in the global food supply and the technology that needed to be implemented to ensure future food security and sustainability. They stated that food crisis worsened around the world in 2008 due to rapidly increasing food prices and lack of credit. Many people experienced poverty around the world, leading to food riots in Bangladesh, Haiti, and Somalia. Some of the factors that played a key role in worsening global food crisis, include climate change, growing cultivation of biofuel crops, intensive use of energy, and economic growth. David Baines and Paul Fray suggested that food sustainability and security were to play a key role in overcoming the problem of global food crisis. Technology that was needed for a sustainable food supply was to consider every aspect of the food supply-chain, including all its inputs and outputs.",Not About Sufficiency
"Identification, physical mechanisms and impacts of drought–flood abrupt alternation: a review","Climate change has led to an increase in the frequency of extreme events, such as droughts and floods. This study aims to review the literature on the newly proposed phenomenon known as drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA). A comprehensive summary is provided to round up the numerous approaches employed to identify DFAA events, as well as its mechanisms and impacts. To provide a reference for responding and managing the emerging intensity and frequency of DFAA events, we conclude the paper by listing the insufficiency of current research and suggesting possible future research directions. As for the impact of DFAA, besides the loss of life and property which can be caused by any natural disaster, a DFAA event severely threatens food security by making a lasting and profound impact on the land productivity through the alteration of the combining conditions of water, soil, and temperature. As for the future research directions, existing indexes developed for DFAA identification should be improved by downscaling the temporal and spatial scale, with interactions of neighboring drought and flood events taken into consideration. What’s more, to better protect human society from the losses caused by DFAA, researches on accurate DFAA prediction are encouraged.

Climate Change and Pulses: Approaches to Combat Its Impact,"The global climate change and extreme weather fluctuations are the most threatening challenges of this century to agriculture and allied activities. Impact of climate change due to increased intensity and frequency of storms, drought and flooding, precipitation variance, and increase in temperature and CO2 have serious implications for global food production and food security (IWGCC in Adaptation to climate change in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries: perspective, framework, and priorities, 2013). Agriculture in India will be under severe constraints as the productivity of crops is predicted to depress by 10–40 % by 2080–2100. This will not only put a severe strain on national economy but will also pose a formidable challenge to achieving food security at the national level. Most of the standard climate models predict rise in temperature across the regions where pulses are grown. With rising temperature, the host of biotic and abiotic stresses is predicted to become more severe in terms of their scope and spectrum, and adversely impacting productivity and stability of production of pulse crops. Such a scenario emanating from the climate change presents a veritable challenge to food and feed economy of the country as large population of India is heavily dependent on agriculture for food and income. To meet these emerging challenges of climate change, there is an urgent need for developing policy framework for implementing approaches for mitigation and adaptation to combat adverse impacts of climate change and climate variability on Indian agriculture especially dryland areas which account for 40 % of the total food production of the country. Therefore, a strong institutional support is required to strengthen the existing research system and infrastructure exclusively targeted to rainfed crops like pulses which are more vulnerable to climate change. Crop production management technology involving judicious use of integrated disease and pest management combined with improved agricultural practices may be used to develop integrated packages for pulse crops to ensure sustainable production under adverse impacts of climate change. © 2015, NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences).",Not About Sufficiency
The role of forest biotechonomy industry in the macroeconomic development model of the national economy of Latvia: An in-depth insight and results,"By using system dynamic modelling, this research evaluates the role of Latvian forest biotechonomic - more efficient exploitation of natural resources and higher added-value in processing of biological goods - industry in the macroeconomic development model of the national economy of Latvia by year 2047. In addition, research primarily focusses on three notable macroeconomic sectors - natural resource exploitation, education and healthcare. For the purposes of investigation, a causal loop diagram and corresponding system dynamics model of the national economy of Latvia was developed. By introduction of forest biotechonomy in the national economic model, results show that financial resources become more available for education and healthcare sectors; however, not to the significant level formerly anticipated. Furthermore, forest biotechonomy introduction also reinforces further development of high-added value industries and general economic growth via relative productivity increase and prolonging of relative working hours. Such results are achieved while proportionally diminishing impact of economic growth on environment This research indicates that forest biotechonomy could be considered an influential and sustainable additional driver of economic growth in Latvia in the years to come. Furthermore, by highlighting certain limitations of the particular investigation, this research sets out potential realms of further research to come. © 2018 The Authors.

Agricultural diversification: The potential for underutilised crops in Africa's changing climates,"Two of the greatest challenges currently facing humanity are the potential consequences of climate change and the actual consequences of reduced agricultural diversity. This paper considers the consequences of both climate change and reduced agricultural diversity on global food security and nutrition. The inextricable link between climate change and crop diversity is examined, particularly in the context of crop production in Africa where most agricultural diversity exists and where climate change will have most impact. The Green Revolution, often seen as a model for increasing global agricultural productivity, is reconsidered in terms of its failure to make a significant impact in hostile tropical environments such as those of much of Africa. An alternative or, at least, a complementary strategy, is advocated where we might better harness the huge repository of indigenous plant species cultivated and conserved by local communities for many generations across variable climates. An example is given of multidisciplinary research on bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea), an ancient grain legume grown, cooked, processed and traded mainly by subsistence women farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. The experience gained on bambara groundnut is considered as a basis for similar efforts on many other potentially useful underutilised food crops in the climates of the future.",Not About Sufficiency
National Policies and strategies on science and technology for development.,"Malaysia's economy continues to be dependent upon the primary producing sectors, based on the exploitation or use of her natural resources. At this Malaysia is the world's largest exporter of natural rubber, tin, tropical hardwoods and palm oil. There is still wide scope for developing new application of science and technology in the rubber industry, and the scope remains even wider in other agricultural sectors. In order to accelerate development in the traditional agricultural sector, that is, those related to food production, the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) was established in 1970 to undertake research in the development of crops other than rubber. Progress has been relatively slow in the development of agriculture. In forestry much work needs to be done in the application of science and technology to forest management, logging, timber utilization, silviculture and the related field of forest regeneration, tree breeding, forest protection and soil conservation. Further development of the mining sector calls for the application of new technology both in prospecting for new sources of minerals and in exploitation. Development of off-shore technology will become increasingly important. Although a major sector in resources development is energy, there is, as yet, no energy policy. Structural diversification is recognized as a basic need for the economic development of Malaysia.

Threshold Effects of Economic-Policy Uncertainty on Food Security in Nigeria,"The study investigated the threshold effects of economic-policy uncertainty on food security in Nigeria, covering the period from 1970 to 2021. Summary statistics and unit root tests were employed for preliminary analysis, while the threshold regression model was used to realize the key objective of the study. The results revealed that adult population (ADULTPOP), environmental degradation (ENVT), exchange rate uncertainty (EXRU), financial deepening (FINDEEP), food security (FS), government expenditure in agriculture uncertainty (GEAU), global economic uncertainty (GEU), inflation (INF), and interest rate uncertainty (INRU) showed positive mean, maximum, and minimum values over the study period. Most variables exhibited low volatility, except for inflation (SD = 15.619) and interest rate uncertainty (SD = 8.435), which had relatively higher volatility. ADF and PP unit root tests indicated that ADULTPOP, FINDEEP, and FS had unit roots in levels, but became stationary after first differencing (integrated of order one). ENVT, EXRU, GEAU, GEU, INF, and INRU were stationary in level, indicating they were integrated of order zero. The result showed a threshold value of 0.077 for global economic uncertainty (GEU). Above this threshold, exchange rate uncertainty (EXRU) had a statistically significant effect on food security (p = 0.031). Non-threshold variables such as adult population (p = 0.000) and environmental degradation (p = 0.000) also had significant effects on food security. The study thus provided evidence of threshold effects of economic-policy uncertainty on food security. The study recommends that policymakers incorporate threshold values in policy implementation to mitigate risks linked to high economic-policy uncertainty. The Government is also advised to establish strategies for stabilizing exchange rates or alleviating their harmful effects on food supply, which may be crucial for achieving food security. © 2025 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Emerging Technological Issues in African Agriculture: A Systematic Review,"Given Africa's productive potential, addressing constraints to agricultural productivity in Africa will need inventive techniques will need inventive techniques. Having in mind the aforementioned, the study explores the impact of developing concerns in African agriculture, such as maize fall armyworm, cereal aflatoxins, African swine fewer in pigs, and climate change-related issues in agriculture and proposes remedies. This was performed by a scoping review using bibliometrics (Web of Science, CiteULike, and Science Direct) as well as a systematic review covering the years 2008–2021. The findings have revealed that developing concerns have a severe influence on agricultural and food security in Africa, particularly among the poor. Furthermore, the findings have demonstrated that sustainable technologies can address rising difficulties in African agriculture. However, various programs that promote the progress of creative and advanced technology might be implemented to develop frameworks for managing developing difficulties in African agriculture. Production in African agriculture must be boosted by the implementation of innovative and modern technology. © 2024, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Agriculture.

Challenges to Sustainable Development along Peruvian Coastal Zones,"A National Workshop took place in Peru in May 2012 before the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development: Rio+20 Summit. Its purpose was to identify challenges for the sustainable development of Peruvian coastal zones. To do this, a public request for proposals was sent to national entities from all sectors before the workshop. During the workshop, proposals were discussed among all participants and then categorized using five main topics and ten cross-thematic concerns. Recommendations were also drafted for policymakers to consider when designing new public policies in order to ensure the sustainable use and development of Peru's coastal areas.Specifically, the ten cross-thematic needs and concerns identified by participants were:. •Increase scientific and technological research.•Reform the professional profile for ocean-related careers.•Take multisectoral approaches addressing socioeconomic issues.•Promote the socioeconomic development of artisanal fishermen and fisheries for human consumption.•Strengthen the value chain of artisanal fisheries.•Promote governmental, civic, and corporate social responsibility and environmental commitment.•Increase environmental education and awareness.•Health, fisheries, and trade certifications.•Spatial planning and integrated coastal zone management.•Legal reform to eliminate overlapping responsibilities between authorities.Main recommendations from the workshop are: •Implement an Action Plan for Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change in coastal marine areas.•Develop a national strategy for risk management to identify the threats and opportunities of climate variability.•Implement co-management tools with artisanal fishing communities and other stakeholders.•Expand school and university curricula to encourage principles of environmental education.•Introduce comprehensive legislation to identify and resolve overlapping attributions in order to make ecosystem-based management possible, and to clearly designate appropriate uses of marine and coastal zones.•Use management tools such as Methods of Impact Quantification (MIQ) and Methods for Compensation Mechanisms (MCM) to meet growing demands and reduce social conflict along the Peruvian coast. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Stakeholder perceptions of the effectiveness and efficiency of agri-environment schemes in enhancing pollinators on farmland,"In parts of the northern hemisphere, many pollinator species are in decline, with potential adverse implications for pollination and the ecosystem service of food production. It is therefore important to understand how habitats primarily orientated towards food production can be managed in an efficient way to enhance pollinator populations for current and future food security. In Europe, agri-environment schemes are a well-established method for promoting nature conservation on farmland. Some previous studies indicate that certain agri-environment schemes may be beneficial to pollinator populations by promoting increased floristic diversity in agricultural habitats. However, there has been no analysis of the efficiency or cost-effectiveness of these interventions. We used an online survey to evaluate the perceptions of growers in England following the Conservation Grade environmentally-sensitive farming protocol, regarding the effectiveness of different agri-environment scheme options in enhancing pollinators on their farms and the costs of implementation. Options within the agri-environment schemes that were perceived as most effective in enhancing pollinators were those related to improving floristic diversity of field headlands and enhancing or restoring semi-natural grassland. However, these options were not generally the most efficient, due to their high cost. Hedgerow management interventions were shown to be the most efficient, despite being perceived as relatively ineffective, due to the low costs of these options. We have therefore found that there is often a mis-match between effectiveness and efficiency of interventions for enhancing pollinators. Trade-offs are likely to be necessary when making decisions on implementing interventions, and farm size as well other local differences should be taken into account in this decision-making process. © 2015 The Authors.",Not About Sufficiency

Gender and life cycle approach in social protection to improve environmental managemet for urban sustainability,"The purpose of this study is to describe the environmental management strategy using gender and life cycle approach through social protection activities. Social protection activities are important in urban areas that undergo a transformation post-disaster in their urban system, related to the life cycle of people in the city and the framework of urban sustainability. The social protection will also increase people's access to environmental resouces so that people are able to participate in environmental management. Vulnerabilities and risks due to environmental degradation of cities require social protection efforts for the community, especially women includes household (family) to strenghten human skill in life cycle. The research used the AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method. This method utilized the expert judgments in the form of options that must be done by the stakeholders. The results of this study show that social protection with gender mainstreaming will increase the ability of citizens to participate and strengthen communities in managing the urban environment that achieve social justice for the community for the sustainability of the city. The contribution of this study can be an alternative strategy for environmental management in the city and more gender responsive policy making. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",Not About Sufficiency
Balancing water scarcity and quality for sustainable irrigated agriculture,"The challenge of meeting the projected doubling of global demand for food by 2050 is monumental. It is further exacerbated by the limited prospects for land expansion and rapidly dwindling water resources. A promising strategy for increasing crop yields per unit land requires the expansion of irrigated agriculture and the harnessing of water sources previously considered ""marginal"" (saline, treated effluent, and desalinated water). Such an expansion, however, must carefully consider potential long-term risks on soil hydroecological functioning. The study provides critical analyses of use of marginal water and management approaches to map out potential risks. Long-term application of treated effluent (TE) for irrigation has shown adverse impacts on soil transport properties, and introduces certain health risks due to the persistent exposure of soil biota to anthropogenic compounds (e.g., promoting antibiotic resistance). The availability of desalinated water (DS) for irrigation expands management options and improves yields while reducing irrigation amounts and salt loading into the soil. Quantitative models are used to delineate trends associated with long-term use of TE and DS considering agricultural, hydrological, and environmental aspects. The primary challenges to the sustainability of agroecosystems lies with the hazards of saline and sodic conditions, and the unintended consequences on soil hydroecological functioning. Multidisciplinary approaches that combine new scientific knowhow with legislative, economic, and societal tools are required to ensure safe and sustainable use of water resources of different qualities. The new scientific knowhow should provide quantitative models for integrating key biophysical processes with ecological interactions at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. © 2015.

"Effect of deficit irrigation and soil fertility management on wheat production and water productivity in the Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia","In the Ethiopian Upper Blue Nile Basin, like in other regions in the world, agricultural productivity is declining due to water scarcity owing to longer dry seasons coupled with soil acidity−induced fertility problems. Wheat is one of the major food security crops in Ethiopia but its productivity is reduced due to water scarcity, especially during the irrigation season. Addressing these problems might be essential to increase productivity. This study explores the effect of deficit irrigation (DI) combined with lime, manure and inorganic fertilizer on wheat production and water productivity (WP) in the Koga irrigation scheme, Ethiopia. Four levels of DI strategies (100% ETc or 0% deficit as a control, 80%, 60% and 50% ETc) were applied for two irrigated seasons. Five levels of soil fertility management were applied for four consecutive cropping seasons: (i) 0.86 t ha−1 lime combined with 3 t ha−1 manure and full dose urea and NPS−B (hereafter referred to as inorganic fertilizer) (L3); (ii) 1.15 t ha−1 lime combined with 3 t ha−1 manure and full-dose inorganic fertilizer (L2); (iii) 1.43 t ha−1 lime combined with 3 t ha−1 manure and full dose inorganic fertilizer (L1); (iv) 3 t ha−1 manure combined with full dose inorganic fertilizer (M); and (v) full dose inorganic fertilizer alone (C). The grain yield and biomass data were collected at harvest from a sample area of 2 m × 3 m from each plot with three replicates. The effect of DI and liming, as well as manuring on average grain yield and biomass, were highly significant. Under all irrigation scenarios, higher grain yield and biomass were found at L1, L2, L3 and M (in that order), compared with C. The highest WP was obtained at 50% ETc irrigation dose, compared with 60%, 80% and 100% ETc (in that order). Yet, the lowest WP was found at C under all irrigation scenarios compared with L1, L2, L3 and M. The WP increased when the amount of water supply decreased and liming doses increased. The application of full dose lime and manure combined with 50% ETc DI resulted in comparable grain yield, biomass and WP as 100% ETc full irrigation at L3 and M. It could be concluded that liming and manuring could be used to mitigate the yield penalty effect of DI in the study area. In scenarios where farmers have to pay for water, profitability rises as the irrigation water supply reduces. Thus, under such conditions, a 50% ETc irrigation scenario is more profitable than scenarios with 60%, 80% and 100% ETc irrigation. © 2022 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Deficit irrigation as a sustainable option for improving water productivity in sub-Saharan Africa: The case of Ethiopia a critical review,"Improving irrigation water management and enhancing water productivity (WP) is required to address future water scarcity in the sub-Saharan region. MaximizingWPby exposing the crop to a certain level of water stress using deficit irrigation (DI) is considered a promising strategy. To adopt DI strategies, a shred of comprehensive evidence concerning DI for different crops is required. This review aims to provide adequate information about the effect of DI on WP. The result showed that DI considerably increasedWPcompared to full irrigation. Despite higher WP, the reduced yield was obtained in some of the studied DI practices compared to full irrigation. It was also found that yield reduction may be low compared to the benefits gained by diverting the saved water to irrigate extra arable land. Maize revealed the highest (2.7 kgm−3) and lowest (0.5 kgm−3)WPwhen irrigated at only the initial stage compared with being fully irrigated in all growth stages. Also, onion showed a decreasingWPwith increased irrigation water from 60% crop water requirement (ETc) (1.8 kgm−3) to 100% ETc (1.3 kgm−3). Increasing water deficit from 100 to 30% ETc led to an increase of wheat WPby 72%. For tomato, the highestWP(7.0 kgm−3) was found at 70% ETc followed by 50% Etc (7.0 kgm−3) and 85% ETc (6.9 kgm−3), while 100% ETc showed the leastWP(6.8 kgm−3). Teff showed the lowestWP(1.7 kgm−3) under optimal irrigation, while it was highest (3.0 kgm−3) under 75% ETc throughout the growing season. The regression analysis forWPincrement and yield reduction versus saved water showed higher values, indicating that DI could be an option forWP increment and increasing overall yield by expanding irrigated area and applying the saved water in water-scarce regions. © 2021 The Author(s).

The important contribution of renewable energy technologies in overcoming Pakistan's energy crisis: Present challenges and potential opportunities,"In recent years, the environmental and economic consequences of coal, gasoline and other conventional energy sources have been widely discussed. Currently, Pakistan's energy output is highly dependent on these resources; as a consequence, the country is facing a severe energy crisis. The government spends more than $3.7 billion annually on fossil fuel imports, which has a significant impact on an already vulnerable economy. Moreover, the country is ranked as the seventh-most impacted region by climate change, making it critical for the government to take proactive measures. Renewable energy that is both economical and sustainable will become a realistic and viable choice for satisfying Pakistan's current and future energy demands. This article provides a detailed overview of Pakistan's long-standing energy scarcity concerns and discusses the country's current renewable energy challenges and opportunities. Additionally, Pakistan's efforts in the realm of renewable energy are compared to those of other Asian nations in order to understand how these countries are advancing renewable energy sources. Numerous statistics show that despite government initiatives, the amount of power generated from renewable sources falls short of the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan’s (IGCEP’s) 2025 and 2030 targets. Achieving these aspirational targets will require competent policies, incentives, technological expertise and substantial political and financial commitments. Hence, this article also advised policymakers and city municipalities on how to enhance energy infrastructure, knowledge and the capacity for overcoming future challenges. In contrast, the development of renewable energy in Pakistan has been an extremely successful endeavour, but an effective and efficient approach is necessary to leverage the benefits of rapid progress. © The Author(s) 2022.",Not About Sufficiency
Suicide rates in Iceland before and after the 2008 Global Recession: A nationwide population-based study,"Background: Economic downturns have been associated with increased suicide rates. The 2008 global financial crisis varied across countries but hit Iceland relatively hard. We aimed to study potential changes in suicide rates in Iceland during this major economic transition. Methods: Data were retrieved on all suicides in Iceland during 2002-14. The study period was divided into a pre-collapse period (2002-08) and a post-collapse period (2008-14). Poisson regression models were used to estimate the association between pre-to-post economic collapse and suicide rates, expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were stratified by age and sex. Results: A total of 470 suicides were recorded during the study period. The mean age at death was 45 years and 75% were males. The overall suicide rates per 100 000 were 13.3 pre-collapse and 15 post-collapse revealing no overall differences in pre-to-post collapse (RR 1.12; CI 0.94-1.35). This was true for both men and women (RR 1.18; CI 0.96-1.46 and RR 0.96; CI 0.67-1.38, respectively). An increase in the unemployment rate was not associated with the overall suicide rate (RR 1.07; CI 0.86-1.33), and neither were changes in gross domestic product (RR 1.29; CI 0.94-1.79) or balance of trade (RR 1.08; CI 0.96-1.22). Conclusion: The economic collapse and rising unemployment rates in Iceland did not result in an overall increase in suicide rates. A strong welfare system and investing in social protection during the economic crisis may have mitigated suicide risk. © 2020 The Author(s).

"Farmers’ maladaptation: Eroding sustainable development, rebounding and shifting vulnerability in smallholder agriculture system","Adaptation has become crucial in developing economies due to climate change impact, especially on agriculture, which is the backbone of many economies and the main source of livelihoods and food security. Some adaptation strategies applied in the context of developing countries, however, produce maladaptive outcomes, which are usually ignored in the planning phase of adaptation policies and programmes. This mixed methods study therefore explores adaptation strategies and the associated maladaptation outcomes of smallholder farmers in rural Ghana. The study administered questionnaire survey to 378 farmers and 41 key informants were interviewed. The major adaptation strategies of farmers included crop and livelihood diversification, agrochemicals application, and reduction in the number and size of meals. However, farmers’ adaptation strategies result in maladaptation outcomes through the release of greenhouse gases, environmental degradation, and contamination of water bodies as well as resource conflicts and increasing pressure on lands, among others, which affect their capacity to respond to future climate change. Adaptation policy makers and development practitioners should prioritize the minimization of maladaptation outcomes through intensive review and modification of programmes prior to their implementation and extensive education on best practices among smallholder farmers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Factors affecting the adoption of multiple climate-smart agricultural practices in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of India,"Climate change poses a major threat to agricultural production and food security in India, and climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is crucial in addressing the potential impacts. Using survey data from 1,267 farm households in 25 villages from Bihar and Haryana in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, this study analyzes the factors that determine the probability and level of adoption of multiple CSA practices, including seeds of stress-tolerant varieties, minimum tillage, laser land leveling, site-specific nutrient management and crop diversification. We applied a multivariate probit model for the simultaneous multiple adoption decisions, and ordered probit models for assessing the factors affecting the level of adoption. The adoption of the various CSA practices is interrelated, whereas several factors, including household characteristics, plot characteristics, market access and major climate risks are found to affect the probability and level of CSA adoption. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) adoption and its intensity also vary significantly between eastern Bihar, which is relatively poor and densely populated, and north-western Haryana. Engaging multiple stakeholders such as farmers, agricultural institutions, agricultural service providers and concerned government departments at the local level is crucial for the large-scale uptake of CSA. The study, therefore, calls for agricultural policy reforms so that most of the issues related to the uptake of CSA can be adequately addressed. © 2018 The Authors.

Quantifying the life-cycle health impacts of a cobalt-containing lithium-ion battery,"Purpose: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been criticized for contributing to negative social impacts along their life cycles, especially child labor and harsh working conditions during cobalt extraction. This study focuses on human health impacts — arguably the most fundamental of all social impacts. The aim is to quantify the potential life-cycle health impacts of an LIB cell of the type nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC 811) in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALY), as well as to identify hotspots and ways to reduce the health impacts. Methods: A cradle-to-gate attributional life-cycle assessment study is conducted with the functional unit of one LIB cell and human health as the sole endpoint considered. The studied LIB is produced in a large-scale “gigafactory” in Sweden, the cobalt sulfate for the cathode is produced in China, and the cobalt raw material is sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Potential health impacts from both emissions and occupational accidents are quantified in terms of DALY, making this an impact pathway (or type II) study with regard to social impact assessment. Two scenarios for fatality rates in the artisanal cobalt mining in the DRC are considered: a high scenario at 2000 fatalities/year and a low scenario at 65 fatalities/year. Results: Applying the high fatality rate, occupational accidents in the artisanal cobalt mining in the DRC contribute notably to the total life-cycle health impacts of the LIB cell (13%). However, emissions from production of nickel sulfate (used in the cathode) and of copper foil (the anode current collector) contribute even more (30% and 20%, respectively). These contributions are sensitive to the selected time horizon of the life-cycle assessment, with longer or shorter time horizons leading to considerably increased or decreased health impacts, respectively. Conclusions: In order to reduce the health impacts of the studied LIB, it is recommended to (i) investigate the feasibility of replacing the copper foil with another material able to provide anode current collector functionality, (ii) reduce emissions from metal extraction (particularly nickel and copper), (iii) increase the recycled content of metals supplied to the LIB manufacturing, and (iv) improve the occupational standards in artisanal mining in the DRC, in particular by reducing fatal accidents. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Online and offline representations of biocultural diversity: A political ecology perspective on nature-based tourism and indigenous communities in the Brazilian Pantanal,"The concept of biocultural diversity is confronted with contemporary changes that impact on local communities, such as globalization and digital transformations. Engaging the conceptual flexibility of 'biocultural diversity', we studied nature-based tourism at the intersection of indigenous communities and the digital realm. We employed a political ecology perspective to examine online and offline representations of biocultural diversity in the Brazilian Pantanal, one of the biggest wetlands in the world, and home to groups of peoples known as the Pantaneiros. Data from interviews with 48 stakeholders in the tourist sector were structured along three 'myths'-the Uncivilised, Unrestrained, and Unchanged-for which we have also constructed counter narratives. Each myth denoted the primacy of biodiversity, and ignored broader dimensions of the Pantanal as a bioculturally diverse landscape. The relationships of the Pantaneiros with their environment were found to be intricate and had clear repercussions for tourism, but ironically, reference to the Pantaneiro culture in nature-based tourism was superficial. Moreover, thriving on the myths, this form of tourism perpetuates skewed power structures and social inequalities. Lower-class Pantaneiros likely suffer most from this. We recommend stakeholder engagement with a biocultural design that facilitates the integration of other-than-biodiversity values, and that thereby promotes sustainability of the entire social-ecological system. © 2018 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
Ethnobiology's Contributions to Sustainability Science,"Progress toward the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is insufficient at a global scale. A thorough and interdisciplinary understanding of barriers and levers to sustainability, including synergies and trade-offs between SDGs, is utterly important but still limited. Ethnobiology is often advocated as a key discipline to address this research gap. We conducted a systematic literature review to explore (i) the visibility of ethnobiology within sustainability science, (ii) how ethnobiology understands the notion of sustainability, (iii) if ethnobiology literature on sustainability issues engages differently with nonacademic knowledge and people compared to other types of ethnobiology research, and (iv) which SDGs are addressed (explicitly or implicitly) by ethnobiology. Our study reveals a minimal overlap between sustainability science and ethnobiology literature. The articles reviewed never mention the SDGs explicitly, but often address them implicitly. Reviewed ethnobiological articles addressed themes of relevance to almost all SDGs, especially the linkages between SDGs 1–3 and 15, but always implicitly. Biodiversity's understanding (SDG 15) provides the basis for culture and Indigenous and local knowledge and ensures communities’ food security (SDG 2), health and well-being (SDG 3), and prosperity (SDG 1). We found that ethnobiology does not examine sustainability through the lens of the global sustainability agenda, and that knowledge coproduction processes are rarely reported. While ethnobiology demonstrates its relevance to address SDGs and contribute to transformative change, this potential is not fully realized because of a persisting decoupling between place-based research and global sustainability frameworks. © The Author(s) 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Just Transitions: Gender and Power in India’s Climate Politics,"This book turns critical feminist scrutiny on national climate policies in India and examines what transition might really mean for marginalized groups in the country. A vision of “just transitions” is increasingly being used by activists and groups to ensure that pathways towards sustainable futures are equitable and inclusive. Exploring this concept, this volume provides a feminist study of what it would take to ensure just transitions in India where gender, in relation to its interesting dimensions of power, is at the centre of analysis. With case studies on climate mitigation and adaptation from different parts of India, the book brings together academics, practitioners and policymakers who provide commentary on sectors including agriculture, forestry and renewables. Overall, the book has relevance far beyond India’s borders, as India’s attempt to deal with its diverse population makes it a key litmus test for countries seeking to transition against a backdrop of inequality both in the Global North and South. This volume will be of great interest to students and scholars of climate policy, gender studies, sustainable development and development studies more broadly. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Seema Arora- Jonsson, Kavya Michael, and Manish Kumar Shrivastava; individual chapters, the contributors.",Not About Sufficiency
The problem of treatment abandonment in children from developing countries with cancer,"Background. There is an inequality gap between the outcome of childhood cancer in resource, rich and limited countries. Abandonment of treatment is one of the reasons for this. Procedure. We searched the medical literature for evidence on abandonment, its causes, and any preventative interventions. Results. Abandonment is a very real problem all across the developing world. Cancers associated with poorer prognosis seem to have higher abandonment rates. It is also related to the socio-economic and educational status of parents, travel time to treatment centers, and affordable, locally available treatment. Conclusions. Twinning between institutions, which includes several preventative interventions, has clearly been shown to work. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Oil spill incidents and pipeline vandalization in Nigeria: Impact on public health and negation to attainment of Millennium development goal: The Ishiagu example,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review oil spill incidents and pipeline vandalism in Nigeria between 1970 and 2006 and to examine the potential danger posed by such activities to public health. Design/methodology/approach - The approach adopted to achieve this objective is questionnaire administration on health impacts. Also secondary sources of information come from textbooks and journals. However, data from natural resources exploitation and hazards are collated and analyzed. Findings - It is evident that, out of the 1,000 reported oil spill incidents analyzed, some hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil are lost to the environment. Graphic pictures of typical oil spill through acts of vandalism in Ishiagu, Ebonyi State, Nigeria are analyzed and reviewed. The run-off and sedimentation of this pollutant in fresh water systems severely degrade water quality, affect fish spawning and aquatic invertebrates' habitats, thus lowering food web productivity. Incidentally the spill-over effect on humans who directly depend on fish and other aquatic food as an alternative protein supplement is quite inundating. The effects on humans include irritation, dermatitis, cancer, occurrence of abortion, organ failure and genetic disorder. Research limitations/implications - The limitations encountered in this research work include logistics problems, poor response and uncooperative attitude from respondents, transportation difficulties and restricted access to impacted sites by law enforcement agents and funding. Therefore subsequent researchers in this area should be equipped adequately with both the necessary protective gadgets and increased funding to meet challenges of this nature. Practical implications - The practical implication of the study is that oil spill incidents should be documented and reported early enough for prompt attention by the regulatory agencies in order to protect and enhance the quality of the environment. Originality/value - The value of the paper is that oil spill and pipeline vandalization devastate the environment, pollute dependable potable water sources such as streams and rivers and should be seen as a serious threat and negation to the attainment of the United Nations Millennium development goals. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency
Structural reform empowers sustainable development and eradicates poverty,"Many countries in the world are projected in the global media to enjoy the benefits of globalization and advanced technology as the blessing of high economic prosperity. In recent years, the real picture emerged when economic crisis even afflicted the well-developed Western countries. It remained as a pre-warning to many developing counties in the world to assess their developmental strategies and economical pursuits. The recent collapse of the economy of Greece is a global lesson for many countries. Some countries blamed their governments adopting a capitalistic market-driven Western model. Others blamed the peoples' inabilities or lack of technological adaptation as the cause for poverty. The concept of poverty is related to development. Social development is broadly understood as a process where people are involved to raise their standard of living by means of activities designed by their free will. So far almost all governments in the world proclaimed this type of development as their agenda and coveted the political powers. How far they have succeeded in providing this sustainable development and empowerment? To understand the situation, we need a clear understanding of the concept of empowerment. This chapter will explore the meaning of empowerment and its intricacies from its ideological origin from Brazilian educationist Paulo Freire, who defined that a people's empowerment can be achieved only through peoples' awareness and participation. Our own renowned economist and Noble Prize winner Amartya Sen says that poverty is not simply the deprivation of basic material needs but concerns significant development in all dimensions of people's life. A quantitative research study is designed to assess the status of empowerment and progress in the present life through conducting a survey of sustainable development. The communication strategy and the structural change needed are also assessed in this research method. The findings of this study will provide us with a policy-related theoretical base. This will provide some information based on which this research can make recommendations and propose a structural reform for achieving sustainable development. Lastly, this chapter will present a method how to eradicate poverty by harnessing the political governance system through reforming existing structure. It can provide proper adoption of technology and media as a participatory means in the hands of local people. © 2017 Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Public Cognizance of E-waste Effects on Human Health and Environment: Evidence from Punjab, Pakistan","The negative effects of electronic waste (e-waste) on the environment and human health are globally acknowledged. Across the world, developing countries in Asia are the most vulnerable countries in hosting e-waste. Informal recycling and crude processing of e-waste cause environmental degradation and harm human health. Therefore, the study analyzes public awareness about e-waste effects on human health and the environment using a logit model with a mean comparison of variables based on primary data of 312 respondents. Meanwhile, the study notifies the correlation of e-waste generation with gross domestic product (GDP), population, and electrical & electronic equipment (EEE) put in the Pakistani market. Moreover, the study discusses other pollutants putting a burden on human lives and the environment in Pakistan.

Artisanal gold mining and surface water pollution in Ghana: Have the foreign invaders come to stay?,"Artisanal gold mining (ASM) is environmentally damaging and often has deleterious health effects for miners and surrounding communities. The absence of effective legal frameworks and secure rights for miners and communities in Ghana exacerbates this problem. From May 2009 to July 2012, we conducted interviews and focus group discussions with artisanal miners, government officials, policymakers, traditional leaders, and large-scale miners in order to examine the conflicts over access and land-use. The results show that a number of factors pose challenges to the willingness of artisanal to mine legally: the legal framework is incoherent; the human, financial, and material resources to enforce the laws (including decentralized structures) are almost non-existent; and, the political will to execute the laws (including control and sanctions on infractions) is limited. Although artisanal mining is reserved for indigenes, the Chinese, Indians, and Serbs have entered and consolidated their niches in the ASM sector. The metamorphosis of the Chinese and other foreigners from large-scale mining investors into artisanal miners is attributable to collusion with self-seeking citizens to circumvent the Minerals and Mining Act. Interestingly, there is ambivalence, which is expressed in citizen's complaints of environmental pollution against the Chinese. Also, three gaps in the legal framework account for the proliferation of foreigners in artisanal gold mining in Ghana: definition of who a mining investor is; lack of provision for mining rights for communities; and ambiguity of some provisions in the framework. The principal reason for policy failure in the ASM sector is that the current intervention mechanisms are predominantly of a technical order and do not take into account the complex socio-political realities in gold mining areas. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
The logic model for Uganda’s health sector preparedness for public health threats and emergencies,"Background: Uganda is an ecological hot-spot with infectious disease transmission belts which exacerbates its vulnerability to epidemics. Its proximity to the Congo Basin, climate change pressure on eco-systems, increased international travel and globalization, and influx of refugees due to porous borders, has compounded the problem. Public Health Events are a major challenge in the region with significant impact on Global Health Security. Objective: The country developed a multi-hazard plan with the purpose of harmonizing processes and guiding stakeholders on strengthening emergency preparedness and response. Method: Comprehensive risk profiling, identification of preparedness gaps and capacities were developed using a preparedness logic model, which is a step by step process. A multidisciplinary team was constituted; the Strategic Tool for Analysis of Risks was used for risk profiling and identification of hazards; a desk review of relevant documents informed the process and finally, approval was sought from the National Task Force for public health emergencies. Results: Target users and key public health preparedness and response functions of the multi-hazard plan were identified. The key capabilities identified were: coordination; epidemiology and surveillance; laboratory; risk communication and social mobilization. In each of these capabilities, key players were identified. Risk profiling classified road traffic accident, cholera, malaria and typhoid as very high risk. Meningitis, VHF, drought, industrial accidents, terrorism, floods and landslides were high risk. Hepatitis E, avian influenza and measles were low risk and the only plague fell into the category of very low risk. Risk profiling using STAR yielded good results. All risk categories required additional preparedness activities, and very high and high-risk categories required improved operational response capacity and risk mitigation measures. Conclusion: Uganda successfully developed a national multi-hazard emergency preparedness and response plan using the preparedness logic model. The plan is now ready for implementation by the Uganda MoH and partners. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
Creative farmers and climate service politics in Indonesian rice production,"Providing climate information services to farmers is expected to optimise agricultural outputs amidst increasing climate uncertainty. Consequently, Indonesian governmental and extra-governmental actors provide climate services with the goal of improving productivity and increasing national food security. Existing research about climate-smart agriculture generally, and climate services in particular, presents these projects as largely technical or anti-political endeavours. Here, we analyse how rice farmers, collectively and individually, engage with climate services. We find that farmers ‘play’ with and between the climate service projects, manipulating them in order to subsidise their livelihoods and assert their individual and collective political power across scales. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Not About Sufficiency
"The challenge of achieving basal energy, iron and zinc provision for home consumption through family farming in the Andes: A comparison of coverage through contemporary production systems and selected agricultural interventions","Background: Child undernutrition is persistently high in the central Andes of Peru, and numerous smallholder households fail to meet their basic needs of energy, iron and zinc. Food-based approaches assume household-level nutrition can be improved following agricultural interventions. This study assesses for the first time whether current Andean production systems provide sufficient energy, iron and zinc output to meet household-level requirements and explores the likely effect of commonly promoted food-based approaches. Across four communities, we determined the crop and livestock production output for each household (n = 165) during one growing season. The household-level nutritional demand or input was calculated as a function of household composition and daily requirements of energy, iron and zinc as established by FAO/WHO. We examined five scenarios, current practice or status quo and four food-based interventions: (1) increased potato yield, (2) introduced biofortified potatoes, (3) promotion of guinea pigs and (4) a mixed strategy combining all of the above. Results: Under status quo, 86, 62 and 76 % of households obtained sufficient production output to meet energy, iron and zinc requirements, respectively. Considering the three parameters simultaneously, 59 % of households were able to meet their energy, iron and zinc requirements. The total crop production among households provided more than the necessary energy, iron and zinc output to meet the demand of all 165 households. Yet, significant differences between households account for individual deficits or surpluses in household-level output-input balances. Potato (Solanum spp.), barley (Hordeum vulgare) and faba (Vicia faba) production was particularly significant in determining the energy, iron and zinc output. Livestock did not make a substantial contribution. The main difference between households with negative versus positive coverage, in terms of household-level production output from agriculture meeting demand (=input), was available cropping area given household size. None of the explored food-based interventions closed the energy, iron and zinc deficit from production among households with negative coverage. Conclusions: The smallholder production systems analyzed are only partially capable of providing sufficient production output to cover household-level energy, iron and zinc demands. Of the four interventions examined, a mixed strategy holds most potential for reducing nutrition gaps. Particularly potato yield increases had a positive effect. The carrying capacity of high-altitude Andean farming systems is strained for households with limited land. Food-based approaches to nutrition under scenarios similar to those reported in this study are advised to balance agricultural interventions with options to enhance off-farm access to food. © 2016 The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Valuating ecosystem services of coastal wetlands through an interdisciplinary educational experience,"Coastal wetlands are vital habitats for human well-being because their ecosystem services are affected by multiple factors. In the quest to reduce the vulnerability of these valuable ecosystems for human beings, education is fundamental to facilitate analysis and answer questions. This paper presents an educational experience of the economic evaluation of El Culebrón Wetland (Coquimbo, Chile) to support decision-makers with new tools and arguments. Real-world experimentation was necessary to stimulate reflection in graduate students on complex problems and proposed solutions that challenged them to consider the different variables and beliefs involved in ecosystem services to put economic theory into practice. A study was developed based on an interdisciplinary educational experience based on two non-conventional methods of economic valuation: Contingent Valuation (CV) and Defensive Expenditure estimation (DE). The results of the 20-year valuation were US$ 5,750,000 (CV) and US$ 3,050,009 (DE). This experience is innovative and promising, allowing the estimation of the economic value of wetlands and reflecting on the opportunities and complexities involved in applying these methodologies. The study concludes that ethical questions were faced from the perspective of balancing economic, social, and environmental issues in pursuing sustainable development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
Promoting climate-smart sustainable agroforestry to tackle social and environmental challenges: The case of macadamia agroforestry in Malawi,"Our current global food system is understood to require a fundamental transformation based on a holistic approach to maintain long-term fertility, healthy biodiverse agroecosystems, and climate-proof/secure livelihoods. Recently, there has been a growing recognition of smallholder farmers' contributions to addressing key global environmental and social development issues, including poverty, food security, climate change, and sustainable development. One specific approach is agroforestry-based agriculture, in which edible food and commercially important trees are grown on cropland, thereby improving the biodiversity of farming systems, enhancing agricultural productivity, and adding benefits such as nutrition and financial stability, not least climate resilience. In this context, we present lessons learned from an agroforestry system in Malawi that involves smallholder farmer cooperatives interplanting macadamia nut trees with annual crops such as groundnuts, maize, and soybeans. We review holistic advantages such as yield improvement, farmer perceptions, and challenges. We provide insights into what works in designing (Neno Macadami Trust and linkage with finance plan) and draw lessons that can be applied to other comparable programmes worldwide. © 2023 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Can agriculture be climate smart?,"Agriculture is highly exposed to climate change, and much of the international climate discourse has focused on the sector's vulnerability, resilience and adaptive capacity for given projected climate scenarios. The sector also has a recognized role in terms of climate change mitigation. The agricultural sector accounts for approximately a third of total global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions from land use change and deforestation. These climate challenges overlap a growing concern about global food security, which highlights additional stressors including demographic changes, natural resource scarcity, and economic convergence in consumption preferences, particularly livestock products. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that, to meet the demands of a larger population (expected to cross 9 billion by 2050), food supply will need to grow by 60 per cent. The term 'climate smart agriculture' (CSA) has been coined to describe practices, systems and institutional arrangements that balance the trade-offs inherent in meeting these objectives. Climate smart agriculture has become a focus of research in developed and developing countries. In this chapter, the authors provide a critical appraisal of the concept of CSA and then review the experiences in implementing CSA in a cross-section of countries in Africa. The chapter discusses the policies and institutional support needed to achieve climate smart agriculture, as well as highlights some of the concerns regarding CSA, especially its sustainability and distributional consequences. © K.N.

Sustaining food security in the Karst Mountains through increasing household income: A case study of Gunungkidul Indonesia,"One of the poverty areas in Indonesia is in Gunungkidul district, an arid area in the karst mountain area. The scarcity of surface water is the main obstacle to economic development activities in the Karst Mountains of Gunungkidul, especially for agriculture and animal husbandry. The vulnerability of nature, agro-climate, and geographical conditions are not suitable for agricultural economic activities. The income of the agricultural community in the karst mountain area is minimal, which causes high poverty. The highly volatile rainfall in the region and extreme climate change can be destructive. Hence, poverty occurs in Gunungkidul, where dry land and Karst Mountains dominate geographical conditions exacerbate this condition. This study investigates the pattern of household expenditure and analyzes the factors that increase household income. This study applied descriptive analysis and income determination function. The results showed that more than half of household expenditure was for food needs. Non-farming activities have a high contribution to household income. Therefore, to increase household income, households must engage in off-farm jobs. The higher the household income, the food security will be sustained. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate impacts on nutrition and labor supply disentangled-an analysis for rural areas of Uganda,"The entire agricultural supply chain, from crop production to food consumption, is expected to suffer significant damages from climate change. This paper empirically investigates the effects of warming on agricultural labor supply through variation in dietary intake in rural Uganda. We examine labor supply, food consumption, and overall social welfare under various climate change scenarios. First, we combine nationally representative longitudinal survey data with high-resolution climatic data using an instrumental variable approach. Controlling for calorie intake, our study shows that warming has a non-linear impact on agricultural labor supply, with the number of hours worked being optimized at an optimal temperature of 21.3°C. Using these econometric estimates to parametrize an overlapping generations model, we find that under RCP8.5, output per adult decreases by 20 per cent by the end of the century due to the combined effect of climate change on food consumption and labor supply.

Reallocating Water: An Application of Sequential Sharing Rules to Cyprus,"Water scarcity has become a major constraint on economic development in many regions of the world and sectoral water reallocation is now widely recognized as an essential step toward the sustainable management of water resources. This paper offers an approach to the reallocation of water among sectors based on sequential sharing rules. An essential feature of this approach is that it takes jointly into account a multiplicity of aspects which are critical to many water reallocation problems, but have often been neglected by the theoretical literature. Such aspects include pre-existing customary (or other) rights, scarcity constraints, the chronological order of sectors' arrivals and environmental water demand. In doing so, our framework can help achieve a solution which is not only more efficient, but also perceived as legitimate and fair. Sequential sharing rules can be used to support or complement other approaches to water allocation, including those based on water markets. Our framework is illustrated using an application to inter-sectoral water reallocation in Cyprus. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Not About Sufficiency
"The nexus between ecological footprint, economic growth, and energy poverty in sub-Saharan Africa: a technological threshold approach","In this study, we investigate the impact of energy poverty on macroeconomic variables. In particular, this study focuses on the technological threshold-based energy poverty approach due to its merits over other techniques to explore the dynamic link between ecological footprint and energy poverty in sub-Saharan African countries from 1995 to 2018. To do so, this study uses second-generation panel unit root and panel cointegration tests. First, the results derived from the cointegration tests reveal the existence of a long-run relationship among the selected variables. Second, this study applies both the random effect model and fully modified ordinary least squares estimates to calculate the long-run elasticities. The results obtained from the above tests indicate that energy poverty significantly reduces the ecological footprint; however, it does not affect the economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, from a policy perspective, developing countries can target energy poverty as a development indicator for protecting the environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Social work perspectives on climate change and vulnerable populations in the Caribbean: Environmental justice and health,"Caribbean small island nations are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and some communities within these nations may be at increased risk for health and mental health consequences. Recent hurricanes and flooding in the region have highlighted the importance of preparation as well as inequities in response to natural disasters. Environmental justice offers a framework for environmental health that acknowledges inequalities arising from global climate change and directs resources to those most affected. Social work as a profession and social workers within communities are uniquely qualified to identify and respond to these environmental health challenges. In this article, the authors use examples from two Caribbean small island nations, Jamaica and Barbados, to explore environmental justice-oriented responses to climate change-related health and mental health challenges and suggest mechanisms for social work intervention. ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency

We consider how best to address the issue of social licence and harmonised governance for novel gene technologies in plant breeding. In addition, we highlight optimised breeding strategies that will enable long-term genetic gains to be achieved. Promoted by harmonised global policy change, innovative plant breeding can realise high and sustainable productivity together with enhanced nutritional traits. © 2021 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Protected areas and territorial exclusion of traditional communities: Analyzing the social impacts of environmental compensation strategies in Brazil,"The creation of the protected areas (PAs) of restricted use dominates conservation policies throughout the world and reflects the western idea of separation between pristine nature and human-modified habitats. However, this conservation strategy has caused the proliferation of environmental conflicts involving territorial rights of traditional peoples and local communities throughout the world. Our study aims to analyze the impacts of the creation of a system of PAs of restricted use on the livelihoods and well-being of traditional communities in the north of Minas Gerais State, in Brazil. We analyzed the conflicts emerging in the study region from the perspective of the environmental justice paradigm. We used the extended-case method, conducting fieldwork to observe and register the movements of social resistance of traditional communities, and interviews with key stakeholders. Between 1970-1990, the Jaíba irrigation project was implemented in the north of Minas Gerais and, to compensate for the huge environmental impact of the project, several PAs of restricted use were created, disregarding the traditional peoples that inhabited the region. As a consequence, these populations were expelled from their territories without compensation or resettlement, causing severe restrictions to their traditional livelihoods and well-being, including access to natural resources such as water, fisheries and timber, and nontimber products, jeopardizing their food security, cultural identity, and social integrity. They initiated the “Movement of the People Cornered by Parks,” lately evolving to “Vazanteiros in Movement,” incorporating elements of the environmental arena to politically dispute alternative conservation projects. Sustainable development policies that incorporate the “economy of repair,” expressed as environmental compensation strategies, are intrinsically contradictory and inappropriate from the perspective of environmental justice. Inclusive conservation planning must account for historical, social, and cultural contexts of the affected region and prioritize the preservation of rights and well-being of local communities. © 2018 by the author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
"Eco-Drama, Multinational Corporations, and Climate Change in Nigeria","Oil explorations by multinational corporations in Nigeria have grave consequences on the ecosystem. Gas flaring, oil spillage, and other forms of land and water pollution seriously degrade the natural environment as well as displace Nigerians from their homes and traditional occupations. Pollution has caused increased flooding, erosion, and dearth of both food and fishes, leading to poverty and hidden hunger, among other problems. More destructive is the reactionary disposition of the Nigerian state to climate change and ecological disasters. Beside the provision of make-shift structures and relief materials to flood victims, there are hardly any proactive efforts on the ground to check the activities of multinational corporations operating in the country. Greg Mbajiorgu's eco-drama Wake Up Everyone (2011) depicts the challenges of the climate crisis in contemporary Nigeria. A close reading and critical analysis of the play, which is a microcosm of the country, illuminates the ways these challenges affect Nigerians and the need for action. Apart from displacing individuals from their homes, flooding takes a heavy toll on the agricultural sector, as most crops and livestock production systems in Nigeria are not yet fully technology-based and are, therefore, susceptible to environmental degradation. As a result, the flooding of farms and plantations, damaging crops and seedlings, leads to a corresponding degree of food scarcity/insecurity and indeed inflation in the cost of farm produce. This paper concludes that conscious efforts suggested in the play should be made to forestall multinational corporations from further pillaging the environment, and that government functionaries saddled with the task of forging active measures to stem the effects of climate change in the country should rise to their responsibilities. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Not About Sufficiency
"Air, Land, and Water Pollution in Africa","Environmental pollution and degradation have put Africa in a deteriorating state and victims have been faced with various challenges in their quest for obtaining justice. Some of the challenges arise from weak legal and institutional frameworks, judicial activism, and environmental governance issues. These obstacles are further complicated by lack of access to basic infrastructures, economic dependence on extractive activities, increased urbanisation, poverty, and illiteracy. A large population of the Continent still directly relies on supplies from the environment for daily survival. The degradation of the environment has resulted in human rights violations and the need to address these environmental issues cannot be overstated with apparent impacts on human development in Africa. In consideration of the above, the article seeks to explore the prospects of conceptual frameworks for environmental rule of law, environmental justice, and sustainable development by employing the human rights-based approach to environmental protection. The study adopts the ‘Environmental democracy’ theory. These concepts are all linked and positioned to address environmental degradation and ensure sustainable human development in Africa. Human development is dependent on the quality of the environment which people are exposed to. The African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights specifically states that people deserve the right to a general satisfactory environment favourable to human development. This recognition by the Charter changes the narrative of the African environment by recognising it as a prerequisite for human development. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
A Multi-Linear Regression Model to Predict the Factors Affecting Water Consumption in Qatar,"Water scarcity is increasingly encouraging water-saving techniques and urban water management schemes committed to reducing the consumption of natural resources and the effects on the ecosystem. A comprehensive understanding of the nature of water supplies is required to design strategies for safe and effective use of water. Water management networks are complex. Consumption of water is affected by various variables, and therefore, the relationship of these variables is also complex. This study examines water consumption determinants in the State of Qatar, focusing on the factors linked to seasonal months by using a multiple linear regression model. The regression model was developed to accurately estimate the water consumption in Qatar to help the government's plan for water usage in Qatar. The results of the model shows that the temperature-related regression coefficient is associated with an increase in water consumption per capita. In addition, an increase in population density for each unit is correlated with a decrease in water consumption per capita. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency

Field studies were carried out for 4years (2005-2008) on 18 field plots to examine yield, inputs, irrigation, costs and economic return of sweet melon, sweet pepper, cabbage and tomatoes grown under drip irrigation vs Rhodes grass grown under sprinkler irrigation using groundwater. The aim was to identify suitable combinations of vegetable crops grown under drip irrigation that can maximize the profitability of the farmers by optimizing water productivity. Results from the 4-year data show that tomato and cabbage performed better than sweet pepper or melon as far as water productivity was concerned, while the drip irrigation method had shown better performance than sprinkler irrigation. Average crop water productivity was estimated at 7.8 and 11.9kg m- 3 for the cabbage and tomato crops, respectively. The cabbage crop also gave the highest gross return of RO105 for each riyal Omani (RO 1.00=US$2.59 in June, 2005) of investment in irrigation water. It has also been analysed that the drip irrigation system performed better in terms of crop water productivity and economic water productivity per cubic metre of water applied. So the research results represent decision-making options of vegetable growers at farm scale but also offer important insights for the adoption of the drip irrigation system as well as the design of water policy incentives for irrigation modernization in Oman and other water-scarce regions. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Level of Awareness and Knowledge Regarding Climate Change Among the People of Dammam, Saudi Arabia","Climate change (CC) is one of the most significant threats to human well-being—affecting all countries, including Saudi Arabia. Addressing CC requires efforts from both the public and government, and understanding people’s CC awareness is critical for devising effective policies to mitigate CC risks. This study is aimed at determining people’s CC knowledge and awareness. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Dammam and involved 310 people who consented to participate. A pretested questionnaire was distributed to collect data about CC. Only a few respondents were aware of CC causes and effects (14%). The significant CC causes identified were deforestation (28.1%), population growth (24.2%), urbanization (18.7%), vehicles (17.7%), and greenhouse gases (11.3%). Most of the respondents were very concerned about CC issues (67%) but (78.4%) had poor knowledge of the Sustainable Development Goals related to CC. Overall, the respondents had moderate knowledge of CC, indicating the need for an effective targeted strategy with a comprehensive action plan for a larger population to reduce the impact of CC. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Not About Sufficiency
Role of education and economic growth on the co2 emissions in Saudi Arabia,"Education can play an effective role in building social responsibility in a community which can help to reduce pollution emissions. This present research investigates the effects of education, energy consumption and economic growth on CO2 emissions in Saudi Arabia using data of a period 1971-2014. We find that primary education could not affect CO2 emissions, but, secondary education has a negative effect while energy consumption has a positive effect on CO2 emissions. In the long run, an inverted U-shaped relationship is found between CO2 emissions and economic growth and Kingdom is found at first stage. Hence, economic growth is responsible for environmental degradation. We recommend to enhance the secondary education to improve the environment of the Kingdom and to use cleaner source of energy to avoid negative environmental consequences of economic growth. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of social cohesion in the implementation of national strategies of climate change struggle,"Purpose: The article deals with the role and contribution of the society in the implementation of strategies on climate change struggle based on the examples of Russian, British, and German practices. Design/methodology/approach: A comparative analysis of the approaches of these three countries reveals that the necessity for society cohesion around the problem of climate change is perceived in Great Britain and Germany, meanwhile in Russia the problem is solved by the state single-handed. Findings: The authors come to the conclusion that social and ecological agenda is an integral part of the modern political discourse, which contributes to the recognition of the urgency of this problem; climate change is a reason for developing a new social-economic policy of the countries that are aware of the climate change problem; global climate changes and natural disasters added to the eternal problem of social inequality a new aspect-the ecological one; the increase of social cohesion is to contribute to people's adaptation to the changing environment, mutual aid in case of emergency, overcoming material and psychological risks connected with climate change; achieving cohesion is a pledge of sustainable and balanced development in the future. Originality/value: The transition to territories' sustainable development requires a review of the conventional technogenic strategy of the economy branches development and formation of the society development strategy based on in-depth study of social, economic, and ecological problems, retrospective analysis of the landscape and a long-term forecast of the expected impact of agricultural activity on the main components of the territory under consideration. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Not About Sufficiency
Protecting the Right to Clean Water: Legal Challenges and Solutions for River Pollution in Kurdistan Region of Iraq,"Access to clean water is a fundamental human right recognised by the United Nations. However, in Iraq, particularly in the Kurdistan region, this right is under significant threat due to severe pollution and contamination of rivers. While the Iraqi Constitution and environmental laws indirectly acknowledge the right to clean water, the legal and institutional framework for river protection remains inadequate. This study focuses on the Tanjero River as a case study to assess Kurdistan region's legal framework and enforcement mechanisms for water resource protection. This study identifies critical gaps in legislation and enforcement through a qualitative and socio-legal methodology, including interviews and analysis of relevant laws such as Law No. 8 (2008) for Environmental Protection and Improvement. The findings reveal that the Tanjero River's pollution is primarily caused by mismanagement of water resources, insufficient legislation, weak enforcement, lack of coordination, and inadequate infrastructure. The Kurdistan Regional Government must prioritise sustainable water resource management, establish a comprehensive legal framework, and implement rigorous enforcement measures to address these issues. These steps are essential to safeguarding the right to clean water, protecting public health, and promoting sustainable development in the region. © 2025 Sriwijaya University.

How does climate change impact remote mountain communities? An empirical investigation in Gilgit-Baltistan,"Understanding of climate change's effects on high-altitude regions is crucial for devising effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. Through a mixed research approach, we investigated the impact of climate change on remote mountain communities in Pakistan, focusing on nine villages in Gilgit-Baltistan. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of these communities to severe climate events such as landslides, flash floods, and glacial lake outburst floods, which have significantly disrupted agricultural activities and other livelihood options, leading to a decline in household food security. The study revealed that livestock rearing and traditional agricultural practices constitute the primary sources of income for these households. However, these practices have been experiencing declining productivity, necessitating the increasing reliance on external markets to meet food demands. In response to these pressing issues, our research strongly advocates for the revival of traditional irrigation systems within these villages. Reviving these systems holds the potential to rejuvenate local food production and reduce reliance on external markets. To achieve this vision, a collaborative effort involving both private enterprises and government bodies is essential, incorporating innovative and climate-resilient irrigation techniques. Additionally, our research emphasizes the promising opportunities presented by Yak husbandry and Sea buckthorn cultivation. These alternative income sources could provide sustainable livelihoods for households in these regions, diversifying their economic base and reducing their dependence on traditional agricultural practices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Balancing agriculture, environment and natural resources: insights from Pakistan’s load capacity factor analysis","Environmental degradation poses a growing threat to sustainable development, and thus, exploring the intricate relationship between the environment, agriculture, and natural resources becomes increasingly crucial for achieving food security, agricultural sustainability, and resource conservation. To this end, this study employs a “novel dynamic autoregressive distributed lags model” and “Kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS)” to empirically establish connections between agricultural expansion, natural resources and their impact on the load capacity factor (LCF) as an environmental indicator. Focusing on Pakistan as a case study with data spanning from 1972 to 2021, the study reveals several key findings. Firstly, the study finds that agricultural expansion has a notably negative impact on LCF in Pakistan, with a coefficient of − 0.419, indicating its detrimental effect on environmental quality. Secondly, natural resources’ negative influence is reflected by a coefficient of − 0.026, underlining their role in reducing the load capacity factor. Additionally, the long-term impact of economic growth is deemed harmful to the load capacity factor in Pakistan, with a coefficient of -0.270. Lastly, a robustness analysis, incorporating ecological balance and the KRLS estimator, lends further support to these findings, underscoring the pressing need for government intervention to enhance environmental conditions. This can be achieved through enacting and rigorous enforcement of environmental regulations, representing a crucial step towards ensuring environmental sustainability.

Impact of climate-smart agriculture adoption on food security and multidimensional poverty of rural farm households in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia,"Background: Climate change has perverse effects on the natural resource base and agricultural productivity, negatively affecting the well-being of households and communities. There are various attempts by the government and NGOs to promote climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices to help farmers adapt to and mitigate these negative impacts. This study aimed to identify CSA practices widely adopted in the study area and examined their impacts on rural farm households’ food security and multidimensional poverty. A three-stage proportional to size sampling procedure was followed to select four districts out of nine districts, and 278 households were randomly selected from two kebeles from each district. A cross-sectional data of the 2020–2021 cropping season were collected using a structured and pretested survey questionnaire. The food consumption score, dietary diversity score, food insecurity experience scale, and multidimensional poverty index, constructed out of 9 indicators, were used to assess households’ food security and poverty status, respectively. A multinomial endogenous switching regression model was used to assess average treatment effects on these outcome indicators. Results: Widely adopted CSA practices are conservation agriculture, soil fertility management, crop diversification, and small-scale irrigation. The results illustrated that adopter households on average showed more food consumption score, dietary diversity score, and less food insecurity experience scale than non-adopters. The results also showed that CSA adopter households, on average, have a low deprivation score in multidimensional poverty than non-adopter households. Accelerating wider adoption of CSA through up-scaling incentives is quite important. Conclusion: This study showed that CSA adoption improves households’ food security and reduces multidimensional poverty. We conclude that up-scaling of CSA practices is important for contributing to the achievement of SDG1, SDG2 and SDG13 targets. © 2022, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
Implications of current and alternative water allocation policies in the Bow River Sub Basin of Southern Alberta,"In this study, economic implications of allocating surface water with the existing policy (seniority rule) and three other alternative (People First, proportional reduction, and trading) policies are investigated to address potential water scarcities in the Bow River Sub Basin (BRSB) of Southern Alberta using a mathematical programming model. The model used an improved calibration technique and 2008 data for three irrigation and three non-irrigation sector users in the BRSB. Results indicate that while the seniority rule favors senior license holding irrigation users and the People First policy favors municipal sector users, irrigation users are better off with the proportional allocation policy even though it affects all users across-the-board. Moreover, if the users can participate in costless trades, then non-irrigation users tend to buy water as they place high value on water at the margin. Some irrigation users find selling water more profitable than utilizing their allocations for crop production. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of tall buildings in sustainable cities,"Tall buildings make up the urban fabric and cannot be viewed in isolation from the city. They also bring up ethical, social, and cultural issues, and they impact the local community - their social needs and what the neighborhoods can gain from creating a new tall building. As with the buildings themselves, the urban context in which tall buildings have evolved has changed dramatically since their Chicago origins, reflecting both social and technological developments. A tall building has been variously called a ""city within a city,"" ""a vertical city,"" and a ""city in the sky."" Thus it is apparent that a tall building is a microcosm of a large city. It is an integral part of the urban habitat having a close relationship with it. In a way it is a vertical progression of a horizontal city. The two are interactive and connected by the transportation, power grid, water supply, and waste production and disposal systems. The tall building can therefore play a vital role in defining livable and sustainable cities. Both cities and skyscrapers must use fewer natural resources; create less waste; and impact less on the natural world. Technology will continue to improve the physical systems of the skyscraper and the city; however, their future will be defined by human interests and values.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of energy types and environmental quality on human health in developing Asian countries,"The use of dirty (fossil fuel-based) energy in the process of economic growth challenges humanity through different health issues.

Global AIDS Reporting-2001 to 2015: Lessons for Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals,"Since 2001 the UNAIDS Secretariat has retained the responsibility for monitoring progress towards global commitments on HIV/AIDS. Key critical characteristics of the reporting system were assessed for the reporting period from 2004 to 2014 and analyses were undertaken of response rates and core indicator performance. Country submission rates ranged from 102 (53%) Member States in 2004 to 186 (96%) in 2012. There was great variance in response rates for specific indicators, with the highest response rates for treatment-related indicators. The Global AIDS reporting system has improved substantially over time and has provided key trend data on responses to the HIV epidemic, serving as the global accountability mechanism and providing reference data on the global AIDS response. It will be critical that reporting systems continue to evolve to support the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals, in view of ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030. © 2017, The Author(s).",Not About Sufficiency
The natural resource curse and economic transition,"Using cross-country regressions, we examine the relationship between ""point-source"" resource abundance and economic growth, quality of institutions, investment in human and physical capital, and social welfare (life expectancy and infant mortality) for all countries and for the economies in transition. Contrary to most literature, we find little evidence of a natural resource curse for all countries. Only the ""voice and accountability"" measure of institutional quality is negatively and significantly affected by oil wealth. In the economies in transition, there is some evidence that natural resource wealth is associated with lower primary school enrollment and life expectancy and higher infant mortality compared to other resource rich countries. Compared to other economies in transition, however, natural resource abundant transitional economies are not significantly worse off with respect to our indicators. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Tradeoffs and synergies between food security and forest cover in Brazilian drylands,"Global food demand is expected to increase in the next decades, pushing agricultural expansion and deforestation. However, food production in agricultural lands is just one dimension of food security, to which forest goods and services also contribute. In this paper, we aimed to explore the relationship between forest cover and food security. We hypothesized that food security is improved by both human-made and green infrastructure combined. To test this relationship, we explore the relationships between forest cover and a multidimensional index of food security that included both socioeconomic and natural variables taken from Brazilian official databases for 1141 municipalities of the Brazilian Caatinga (a seasonally tropical dry forest). The index was formed by 12 principal components axes (12 PCs) and we found that financial poverty (PC 1) and economic inequality (PC 2) were the main determinants of food insecurity in Caatinga. We found that lowest food security values were found in two contrasting contexts: one is represented by poor and unequal municipalities with high forest cover while the other refers to poor and less unequal municipalities but with little forest cover. Municipalities with intermediate levels of forest cover had slightly higher food security, a consistent pattern across time (2006–2017). Win–win scenarios where both forest cover and food security increased with time were almost as common as lose–lose situations (25% and 22% respectively). This suggests a sort of balance between forests and human-made land uses and reinforces that natural capital contributes to food security. Zero-hunger is a main issue for sustainable development goals, and our results adds to the notion that both sustainable use of forests and socioeconomic improvements must coexist rather than being treated as antagonistic policies. © 2023 The Authors.

"Resilience, adaptation and expected support for food security among the Malaysian east coast poor households","Purpose: Sustainable food security at the household level is one of the emerging issues for all nations. It is expected that the patterns of household resilience factors and adaptation practices have a strong linkage with household food security. The purpose of this paper is to seek an effective technique of adaptation for food security and the required types of support for adaptation to food insecurity among the poor and low-income households in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study was based on primary data that were collected in July-October 2012 through a questionnaire survey among 460 poor and low-income households from the Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu states of Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database based on a two-stage cluster random sampling technique. The study considered household food security as household food availability and food accessibility, and ran ordinal regressions to find out the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security. Findings: The study concludes that several resilience factors and adaptation practices were statistically significant to household food security, and several external supports were statistically and significantly needed to ensure household food security. Therefore, to ensure sustainable household food security in Malaysia, the food security programs need to be integrated with sustainable development goals (SDGs) and climatic changes adaptation programs, and the involvement of relevant stakeholders are crucial. Originality/value: This study is a pioneer work based on primary data that empirically measured the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security in Malaysia. This study also discussed some issues related to the climate change linkage, which would help future climate change research. The findings of the study will be beneficial for all the stakeholders, including policy makers related to the food security and climate change adaptation. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Not About Sufficiency

The human well-being and environmental degradation nexus in Africa,"Environmental degradation continues to attract interest from academics, policymakers, and other stakeholders. However, empirical studies have been limited in the choice of human well-being indicators. Therefore, this study extends the literature by broadening the nexus between human well-being and environmental degradation in 29 African countries from 1970 to 2019. Preliminary tests adaptable to effects of cross-sectional dependency and heterogeneity in panel dataset were adopted, alongside the cross-sectional auto-regressive distributed lag model. Findings from the study showed that the adopted human well-being indicators such as globalisation, life expectancy, and human capital development were environmentally enhancing both in the short and long terms. In contrast, income growth was environmentally degrading in the short and long terms. At the same time, urbanisation was only environmentally detrimental in the long term with no significant short-term effect. Natural resource rent which served as a control variable was environmentally degrading both in the short and long terms. Consequently, this study confirms the synergy approach between the environment and human well-being and the trade-off hypothesis in African countries. Thus, African countries’ general resource management policy significantly determines the impact their path to human well-being enhancement has on the environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Not About Sufficiency
"Local foods development to achieve food security in Papua Province, Indonesia","This study describes the problem of high dependency on rice consumption in Papua while Papua has several local foods as alternative sources of carbohydrate. The study focuses on Papua province as the region that has many potential on local-non rice food like corn, cassava, and sweet potatoes, which then selected as the study objects. A ten-year series of data from 2006 to 2015 was obtained from BPS (Central Bureau of Statistics) and analyzed in this study. The results show that the development of local food was relatively slower in Papua Province compared to the national level, except for fish development. It is observed that the program to increase rice production is very intensive while the program to increase local food production has not been a concern of the local government. Programs to increase production, develop cultivation, production, and processing technologies are biased to rice production, resulting in the food diversification program trough local food development is likely difficult to be realized. Papua Province has a comparative advantage in local food because it is supported by the potential of natural resources and the culture of local community. Local food must be encouraged and promoted as-a major, healthy food source and at the same time, support the realization of food diversification programs in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
The effects of climate extreme events on selected food crop yields in Sub-Saharan Africa,"The agricultural sector is essential for economic growth. However, agricultural performance can be limited by factors such as climatic risks. This paper aims to analyse the effect of climate extreme events on selected food crop yield in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The study uses data from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) database for maize, rice, and sorghum yields. Also, we used data obtained from the International Disaster Database of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) for floods and droughts over the period 1990–2020. The data were analysed based on the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS). The results showed that climate extreme events negatively affected maize, rice and sorghum yields. Also, the findings showed that floods and droughts in past years negatively influence current yields of maize, rice and sorghum. Moreover, agricultural labour force, fertilizer and financial development are the main transmission channels through which floods and droughts can affect maize, rice and sorghum yields. The study concludes by recommending that policies aimed at promoting climate change adaptation measures as well as agricultural insurance could make the agriculture sector more resilient to climate extreme events and in turn that could improve agricultural productivity and reduce food insecurity. © 2024 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Global progress in photovoltaic technologies and the scenario of development of solar panel plant and module performance estimation - Application in Nigeria,"Energy is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - a post-2015 blueprint recently agreed upon by the United Nations, to address the energy poverty problem in the global community. This plan, coupled with the need to mitigate climate change and also find alternative energy options to fossil fuels, is expected to continuously lead to increased interests in the development of renewable energy systems, around the world. Such systems have the potential to address the energy deficit in the world's energy poor regions, e.g. sub-Saharan Africa, where about 50% of the 1.2 billion people in the world live without access to electricity. This paper first discusses the state-of-the-art of photovoltaic (PV) technologies worldwide. It then presents the development of solar panel plant, using the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) 7.5 MW solar panel plant in Nigeria as a case study, which is established to build local capacity in PV technologies and also promote their widespread applications. The plant layout design, materials, equipment and production line are discussed. A new technique called Fundamental PV Module Performance Analysis (FPVMPA) is employed to assess the performance of a single NASENI 190 W module in terms of power output, energy yield, capture losses, fill factor, and efficiency, allowing the prediction of the module performance pre-installation, based on IEC 61724 standards. Furthermore, emphasis is laid on the impact of temperature on the module, which affects its efficiency and overall outputs. These analyses are then used to evaluate the performance of a 54.72 kW Photovoltaic Electric Power Generation Plant (PEPGP) that is proposed for a remote mini-estate in Kutunku, Nigeria. Future research directions are also provided on module life cycle analysis, end-of-life management and recycling. Results show the module performance under varying irradiance and temperature conditions, which can be useful for design, planning and application purposes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"The transformation of welfare systems in the Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania","This chapter aims to give a general overview of the main problems and reform challenges of social protection in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania since the collapse of the Soviet regime. Baltic social policy offers an interesting case study, as the experience of Soviet authoritarian rule between 1940 and 1990-91 had an impact on their subsequent trajectories, while post-communist economic and social restructuring has coincided with population ageing and the increasing impact of globalization and Europeanization in recent years. The Baltic economies have experienced rapid economic expansion during the last years of the transition (2000-2007) and had the fastest growing GDPs in Europe (see Table 6.1).1 Consequently, employment opportunities have increased in the Baltic region and unemployment has decreased considerably. However, despite comparatively good economic indicators and GDP growth, Baltic societies spend much less on social protection as compared to the EU-15 and the EU-27 average. The share of GDP spent on social protection in the three Baltic states (12-13 per cent) is among the lowest in the European Union (Keune, 2008, p. 13). Thus, it is not surprising that the income inequalities expressed as a ‘Gini coefficient’ are also the highest in these societies, ranging from 36 in Estonia and Lithuania to almost 38 in Latvia (Table 6.2). The absolute poverty rate is non-existent in the EU-15 countries and also in the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Hungary, but it is still present in the three Baltic states. © Palgrave Macmillan, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited 2009.",Not About Sufficiency
The links between climate change and migration: a review of South Asian experiences,"Migration, or human movement from one place to another, is nothing new. Numerous studies have found that, due to climate change and various extreme weather events, relocation to other places is increasing, and experts often say that these events will have a significant impact on human migration in the future, especially in South Asia. This article comprehensively reviews the literature on climate change and migration in South Asian countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) published between 2000–2023. Based on this review we create a typology that we call “Multilayered or Integrated Climate-Induced Migration” (MICIM) and explain the link between climate change and migration in South Asian countries through three possible pathways. First, temporary migration is seen as a livelihood-diversification strategy, with reliance on temporary migration increasing during extreme weather occurrences or other times of environmental change. Second, when agricultural productivity drops due to climate change or other weather occurrences, people often move to new areas as a means of protecting themselves from food/water insecurity. Finally, we found that in South Asian countries, extreme climatic events such as floods, cyclones, etc., resulted in forced relocation. Importantly, we also found that existing social inequality plays a significant role in migration decisions in South Asian countries. Accordingly, migration is not an equally viable option for all groups, even if they face climate vulnerabilities. Further research, as well as adaptation plans, are required for these “trapped populations”. We identified some gaps in the existing literature and suggest that further investigation, using a more intersectional lens, should be undertaken in order to more comprehensively, context-specifically and comparatively, explore the relationships between climate change and migration. Furthermore, there is a need to generate improved employment opportunities and livelihood options in South Asian nations, particularly in times of natural calamities such as floods, droughts, cyclones, and similar occurrences, especially for those who are unable to migrate to other places due to lack of resources. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
An Overview of Smart Irrigation Management for Improving Water Productivity under Climate Change in Drylands,"Global drylands, covering about 41% of Earth’s surface and inhabited by 38% of the world’s population, are facing the stark challenges of water scarcity, low water productivity, and food insecurity. This paper highlights the major constraints to agricultural productivity, traditional irrigation scheduling methods, and associated challenges, efforts, and progress to enhance water use efficiency (WUE), conserve water, and guarantee food security by overviewing different smart irrigation approaches. Widely used traditional irrigation scheduling methods (based on weather, plant, and soil moisture conditions) usually lack important information needed for precise irrigation, which leads to over- or under-irrigation of fields. On the other hand, by using several factors, including soil and climate variation, soil properties, plant responses to water deficits, and changes in weather factors, smart irrigation can drive better irrigation decisions that can help save water and increase yields. Various smart irrigation approaches, such as artificial intelligence and deep learning (artificial neural network, fuzzy logic, expert system, hybrid intelligent system, and deep learning), model predictive irrigation systems, variable rate irrigation (VRI) technology, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could ensure high water use efficiency in water-scarce regions. These smart irrigation technologies can improve water management and accelerate the progress in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where no one gets left behind. © 2023 by the authors.",Not About Sufficiency
"CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN COASTAL BANGLADESH: MIGRATION, GENDER AND ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE","Sea level rise, tropical cyclones, saltwater intrusion, and coastal flooding along with many other natural hazards are increasingly common in many parts of the world, and regions like coastal Bangladesh are at the frontline of these impacts. Due, in part, to the ongoing climate crisis, male members of coastal households in Bangladesh are outmigrating temporarily or permanently. Reduced farm productivity can be blamed on this to a large extent. Men leave female members of their households behind in their coastal villages during the first phase of migration. This creates a new form of social injustice as women are not only exposed to the negative impacts of the climate crisis to a larger extent, but they also face the challenges of maintaining a farming livelihood as they confront patriarchal socio-cultural norms and expectations during the absence of male members of the families. Using the frameworks of critical development and political ecology, this paper unpacks how these farming women who stay in the rural villages in coastal Bangladesh have a higher social vulnerability then men do. More particularly, this paper illustrates the complex nature of social and environmental injustice, experienced by women because of the outmigration of male members of the households. An intersectional approach further explains how, in contrast to usual class / income privileges, religio-cultural norms and prohibitions result in women belonging to the ethno-religious majority being more vulnerable than minority women. This is due to restrictions from interacting alone with men to whom they are not related, which reduces their access to the knowledge and resources that flows though male-dominated social networks. This article contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between humans and the environment, mediated by various social, cultural, and political factors, and provides critical policy insights on inclusive adaptation and long-term sustainability. © 2021 The Royal Society for Asian Affairs.",Not About Sufficiency
A science framework (SF) for agricultural sustainability,"The significance of Science Framework (SF) to date is receiving more acceptances all over the world to address agricultural sustainability. The professional views, however, advocate that the SF known as Mega Science Framework (MSF) in the transitional economies is not converging effectively in many ways for the agricultural sustainability. Specially, MSF in transitional economies is mostly incapable to identify barriers in agricultural research, inadequate to frame policy gaps with the goal of strategizing the desired sustainability in agricultural technology and innovation, inconsistent in finding to identify the inequities, and incompleteness to rebuild decisions. Therefore, this study critically evaluates the components of MSF in transitional economies and appraises the significance, dispute and illegitimate issue to achieve successful sustainable development. A sound and an effective MSF can be developed when there is an inter-linkage within principal components such as of (a) national priorities, (b) specific research on agricultural sustainability, (c) adequate agricultural research and innovation, and (d) alternative policy alteration. This maiden piece of research which is first its kind has been conducted in order to outline the policy direction to have an effective science framework for agricultural sustainability. © 2015 Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

Thirty-five years of research on energy and power: A landscape analysis,"The urgent need to mitigate climate change and decarbonise the energy sector brings the risk that wider social and environmental concerns about the sustainability of energy systems are neglected. Countries may achieve decarbonization goals while reproducing or worsening the unequal distribution of access, opportunities, costs and burdens that is inherent to current energy systems. This study is motivated by the tension between visions for change towards sustainable energy systems and historic and contemporary inequities on the ground. The study contributes a quantitative, global-scope overview of existing research that places energy users and their lives at the centre of analysis for inclusive and equitable transitions. It further identifies the themes, concepts and perspectives that dominate scholarly debate and analyses the presence and relative influence of work that explicitly considers relations of power. The stepwise review uses the Scopus database and multiple bibliometric tools, covering the period until June 2022. It adopts a novel approach to identify dominant and marginal topics, geographical contexts and theoretical lenses employed including the uptake of critical social science approaches. The results indicate that dominant studies fail to engage critically with relationships of power. Even within the debate on “energy poverty”, work based in critical theory approaches account for less than seven percentages of the total body of work. For work on “energy justice” and users, four percentages of publications account for gender. The dominant language is technical and depoliticized. The study identifies research gaps and promising avenues for further research. © 2024 The Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"Gender equality, food security and the sustainable development goals","This paper examines the potential and limitations of SDG 5 (Gender Equality) in helping to achieve household food security. The potential lies in the attention it pays to women's access to land and natural resources, which can significantly enhance women's ability to produce and procure food. Its limitations lie in a lack of attention to the production constraints that women farmers face; its failure to recognise forests and fisheries as key sources of food; and its lack of clarity on which natural resources women need access to and why. Moreover, other goals which bear on food security as important providers of nutrition, such as SDG 15 as it relates to forests and SDG 14 as it relates to fish resources, make no mention of gender equality, nor does SDG 13 (Climate action) recognise the vulnerabilities of women farmers. A bold interpretation of SDG 5 and establishing synergies with other SDGs could provide ways forward. This includes not only SDGs which recognise the importance of gender equality, such as SDGs 1, 2, and 13 on poverty, hunger, and climate change respectively, but also SDGs 14 and 15 whose silence on gender could prove detrimental not just to attaining food security, but also to furthering their stated objectives of resource conservation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency

Drivers of sustainable waste management in Asia,"Drivers of sustainable waste management are defined as groups of related factors that influence the development (or lack thereof) of industry. There has been no attempt to reasonably list the drivers that influence sustainable waste management in Asia. In this review, four groups of drivers of sustainable waste management, specifically of Asia, are explained. The four groups of drivers consist of three human elements (human, economic and institutional) and the environment as a single driving group. Typically, the first three groups have been very influential, with the environment driver, noticeably, only considered when preceded by other groups of drivers. The interconnectedness of the drivers and neglect of the environment driver is discussed. It is concluded that while the essence of the four groups of drivers can be found all over Asia, each driving group must be investigated in a local context and all information combined to devise sustainable waste management policies or strategies. © The Author(s) 2009.",Not About Sufficiency
An Overview of Climate Changes and Its Effects on Health: From Mechanisms to One Health,"Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, widespread deforestation, soil erosion or machine-intensive farming methods, manufacturing, food processing, mining, construction, and the iron, cement, steel, and chemicals industries, have been the main drivers of the observed increase in Earth's average surface temperature and climate change. Rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, ecosystems disruption, agricultural impacts, water scarcity, problems in access to good quality water, food and housing, and profound environmental disruptions such as biodiversity loss and extreme pollution are expected to steeply increase the prevalence and severity of acute and chronic diseases. Its long-term effects cannot be adequately predicted or mitigated without a comprehensive understanding of the adaptive ecosystems. Studying the complex interaction between environmental aggressors and the resilient adaptive responses requires the exposomic and the One Health approaches. The problem is broad and affects the whole ecosystem, plants, pets, and animals in addition to humans. The central role of the epithelial barrier, microbiome, and diet as key pillars for an adaptive tolerogenic immune response should be explored for increasing resilience at the individual level. A radical change in mindset worldwide, with sustainable solutions and adaptive strategies and climate resilience and health equity policies at their center, should be achieved quickly through increased awareness based on solid scientific data. © 2024 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",Not About Sufficiency
"The impact of Iran’s urban heritage on sustainability, climate change and carbon zero","Cities contribute to over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cities are forced to engage in climate mitigation or adaptation measures due to climate change. Low carbon emissions are one of the most significant variables influencing sustainable urban development and combating climate change. Energy is essential and unavoidable for sustainability. Renewable energy will be critical to the world's decarbonized energy future. Ancient Iran was one of the first civilizations to address sustainability and climate change. There is a rich and sustainable urban planning heritage in Iran. Reviewing past experiences, technology, and knowledge is necessary to solve problems and move toward a better future. This manuscript discusses the various types of sustainability within this heritage and how we can utilize them to achieve sustainable development.

Understanding and addressing climate change impacts on cocoa farming in Ghana,"It is an undeniable fact that climate change has negative effects on cocoa production and has thus led to reduced yields in Ghana. This has affected cocoa farmers living standards due to their high dependency on income from sales of cocoa dry beans. The study determined the causes, indicators, effects and mitigative strategies of climate change on cocoa farmers farms. Generally, 71.43 % respondents indicated, climate change was caused by deforestation whereas 26.79 %, especially female farmers, associated it with superstitious connotations. Similarly, 72.86 % of the farmers included shade trees on their farms as a mitigative strategy to climate change's effect. While two farmers abandoned farms, others (17.50 %) sought divine intervention. Marginal effects in M-Logit results revealed that, Education, Variety, Training on Climate Change, Radio and Shade trees were significant (p-value < 0.10), under various dependent variables on causes of climate change. Again, Gender, Education, Household size, Migration status, Credit, Farm age, Variety and Training on Climate Change were also significant (p-value < 0.10), under various dependent variables on farmers mitigative strategies to addressing climate change effects. Results imply the need to intensify climate change education to cocoa farmers, especially females, within the district to help achieve targets of SDG 13 as well as enhancing their living conditions. © 2023 The Author(s)",Not About Sufficiency
Oil and human security challenges in the Nigeria’s niger delta,"The study utilized primary and secondary data to examine the oil-induced human security challenges in the Niger Delta; evaluate the role of the Nigerian Government, oil multinationals and some non-state actors towards human security in the Niger Delta; and analyse the implications of oil-induced human security challenges in the Niger Delta. These were with a view to determining the negative challenges of oil exploitation on human security in the Niger Delta region vis-à-vis human development and peace. The study then revealed that oil-induced human security challenges in the Niger Delta region were visible in the areas of water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution, food insecurity, poverty, conflict and unemployment. The study also showed that the responses to human security challenges in the region by the government, oil companies, the oil-producing communities and international partners had brought appreciable development and peace to the region. However, these were marred by corruption, insincerity, hypocrisy and selfish interest by some stakeholders in the region. The study further identified the implications of oil-induced human security challenges in the region to include vandalism of oil installation, oil theft, kidnapping, sea piracy, food crisis, outbreak of diseases, famine and hunger. It then concluded that oil exploitation has had a negative impact on human security in the Niger Delta region, and this has equally undermined human development and peace in the region. © 2016 Critique.",Not About Sufficiency

"Temporal evaluation of global trends in water footprint, water sustainability and water productivity research","Water security has been an evolving and swiftly developing research area, which is linked to the Water Footprint, Water Sustainability and Water Productivity (WFSP) concept, essential for ensuring food and water security for countries suffering from water scarcity. A scientometric analysis of WFSP studies was done to investigate the global research trends that occurred between 1987 and 2019, using data obtained from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. The publications in overall scopes matched several subjects, countries and journals to WFSP growth trends. The findings from this study showed that WFSP research has significantly increased over the past decades. Countries such as China (22%), the United States of America (16%), India (14%) and the Netherlands (7%) have the most WFSP publications while publications in South Africa was relatively low (2%). Hoekstra was the most productive author with 14 WFSP research publications and 1711 citations (190 citations per year). The Netherlands has the highest number of cited WFSP research publications (24% of citations and an average of 80 citations). The Journal of Agricultural Water Management Journal of Cleaner Production and Ecological Indicators were the top three journals with the most citations and h-indices. The present study concludes that there was a global increase in WFSP research, with the most noticeable outcomes in developed countries compared to developing nations. Enhancing collaboration between multiple countries and authors in the field of WFSP research could provide important scientific solutions to global water scarcity. © 2021",Not About Sufficiency
Cassava production in africa: A panel analysis of the drivers and trends,"Cassava is Africa's most important tuberous crop. It is an all-year-round cheap and reliable staple food for millions of Africans, making it vital for food security on the continent. However, cassava production in Africa is hindered by a persistent problem of low yield per hectare. This study addresses the dearth of research on the specific influences of area harvested and yield per hectare on cassava production in Africa. This work uses panel data from 37 African countries from 1961 to 2020 and sheds light on three key aspects. Firstly, it investigates the extent and nature of the low yield per hectare problem, offering insights into its underlying causes and implications. Secondly, it examines the interplay between area harvested and yield per hectare, revealing the factors driving the observed trends in cassava yields on the continent. Lastly, this study contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 15: Life on Land and Goal 2: Zero Hunger, by providing valuable information to enhance cassava production sustainability. The findings indicate that approximately 95.6% of the variability in production can be explained by changes in the area harvested, around 1.1% by yield variability, about 27.6% by consumer price index and 1.8% by temperature changes. Notably, the study observes a significant increase in the area harvested by 16.8 million hectares and average yield levels varied between 5.7 and 9.6 tonnes per hectare. The analysis also reveals a disparity in translating gains from disease eradication and introducing high-yield, disease-resistant varieties into smallholder cassava farming. In conclusion, the study highlights the potential for sustainable intensification of cassava production as a viable pathway to enhance absolute and per-hectare yields while promoting farmers’ income and mitigating cassava cultivation-related deforestation. Understanding and addressing the low yield per hectare problem in cassava production are crucial steps toward ensuring food security and achieving sustainable agricultural practices in Africa. © 2023",Not About Sufficiency
Navigating trade-offs in land-use planning: Integrating human well-being into objective setting,"There is an increasing demand for development of natural resources, which can be accompanied by environmental degradation. Planning for multiple land uses requires navigating trade-offs between social, economic, and environmental outcomes arising from different possible futures. To explore these trade-offs, we use the Daly River catchment, in Australia’s Northern Territory, as a case study. The catchment contains areas of priority for both conservation and development. In response to the challenge of navigating the required trade-offs, the Daly River Management Advisory Committee (DRMAC) initiated a land-use plan for the region. Both development and conservation of natural resources in the catchment will affect human well-being and the long-term provisioning of ecosystem services in diverse ways. To understand some of these impacts, an innovative engagement process was designed to elicit the relative importance of key factors to residents’ well-being. The process identified 19 well-being factors grouped into four domains: biodiversity, socio-cultural, recreational, and commercial. Overall, the highest-ranked well-being factors were in the social-cultural and biodiversity domains while commercial values were ranked the least important. Respondents reported low satisfaction with commercial factors as well, noting concerns over environmental impacts from existing developments and sustainability of future developments. We identified differences in the reported importance values for several types of stakeholders, most notably between indigenous respondents and those employed in the agricultural sectors. Indigenous respondents placed greater importance on biodiversity and socio-cultural factors. Agricultural respondents placed greater importance on commercial factors. The outcomes of our engagement were integrated into DRMAC’s process of objective-setting to ensure that objectives for each domain were included in land-use planning. Our results can also anticipate potential conflicts between different stakeholders and changes in well-being associated with different land uses. We describe how our findings will inform the next stages of stakeholder engagement and comment on the utility of such an approach for integrating well-being into objective setting for land-use and scenario planning. © 2014 by the author(s).

Urban planning schemes for developing low-carbon cities in the Gulf Cooperation Council region,"Sustainable cities aim to achieve a harmonious balance between human socioeconomic activities and the natural environment to foster low-carbon and livable societies. However, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding the role of urban planning in creating sustainable cities, particularly in the Global South, where carbon emissions are expected to exceed 127% of those from the world's most developed economies by 2040. Within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, which heavily relies on fossil fuels for energy generation and transportation, various low-carbon schemes have been implemented to address environmental sustainability challenges. However, the effectiveness of these schemes has been subject to debate, with some critics seeing them primarily for greenwashing and image-building purposes rather than promoting urban sustainability and achieving SDG targets. This study analyzes the implementation of urban planning schemes and their potential in developing low-carbon cities in the GCC region, focusing on buildings, infrastructure, urban form, transportation, and urban greening. Based on desktop research, the study found that the UAE dominates half of the green building market in the region and generates 82% of total renewables. However, wastewater recycling rates remain low, averaging 34% and ranging from 90% in the UAE to 13% in Kuwait. In terms of urban form, GCC cities have population densities that are less than one-third of the 15,000 persons/km2 recommended by UN-Habitat for sustainable cities. While low-carbon transportation through rail and bus transits are concentrated in capital cities, urban greening initiatives for carbon capture and storage are gaining momentum in various cities. This study highlights the importance of integrating energy and water demand reduction measures into land-use planning and promoting sustainable lifestyles among the public. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Not About Sufficiency

Post-fifth assessment report urban climate planning: Lessons from 278 urban climate action plans released from 2015 to 2022,"Cities respond to climate concerns mainly through climate action plans (CAPs). The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) was the first report from the international climate body that gave worldwide attention to urban climate change. Yet, a global situation of the content and structure of urban CAPs adopted or published after AR5 is not well represented in the literature. This literature void presents a difficulty in holistically understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing urban CAPs, hence painting a clearer picture for future urban climate planning. Here, we performed detailed qualitative content analyses on CAPs from 278 cities worldwide. This study sought to achieve two specific objectives; (1) to critically analyse the content and structure of urban CAPs adopted or published from 2015 to 2022, and (2) to examine the extent to which sampled urban CAPs align with selected climate action best practices. There have been variations in the adoption or publication of urban CAPs from 2015 to 2022 across city types and world regions. Our analysis showed a rise in the number of CAPs adopted or published during the global COVID-19 lockdown period as compared to the post and pre-COVID-19 lockdown period. We also observed a transition from developing mainly mitigation-focused CAPs pre-COP21 to both mitigation and adaptation CAPs. About 96% of the sampled urban CAPs are focusing on the transport sector to achieve climate objectives. More than half (55%) of cities with climate change mitigation-related urban CAPs (147 urban CAPs of 267 urban CAPs) do not have deep decarbonization pledges, with less than a quarter of the pledges likely to be achieved by 2030. We found that about 81% of 120 cities with deep decarbonization pledges are more likely to report baseline emission inventory in their urban CAPs. A lack of inclusiveness, transparency and verification, evidence-based climate planning, comprehensiveness, and integration were the most common areas of non-alignment with best practices. The explicit consideration of synergies, trade-offs, or conflicts is significantly low. The evidence is a catalyst for understanding the dynamics in existing urban CAPs to shape future urban climate action planning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Not About Sufficiency
Bridging conceptual “silos”: bringing together health promotion and sustainability governance for practitioners at the landscape scale,"Environmental health issues are examples of “wicked problems” that require cross-sectoral collaboration at the community level, yet health practitioners and environmental stakeholders find it challenging to see how and why they could be working together. Supportive organisations have been identified as the most vital enabler for individual professionals to participate actively in cross-sectoral initiatives. Ability to justify inter-professional cooperation makes it easier for practitioners to gain the necessary approvals within their institutional mandates. This paper introduces a new conceptual framework that bridges health promotion and sustainability governance to facilitate practical cross-sectoral collaboration that targets complex health-related environmental and social-ecological challenges. The proposed framework integrates six concrete overlapping themes linking health promotion and sustainability governance. The framework also highlights examples of areas where the fields could benefit from one another. Moreover, children's environmental health is proposed as a desirable overall outcome and an attractive venue for potential collaboration, because of its critical role in the public health and well-being of future generations. As a determinant of adult health, children's environmental health emphasises the vital interdependencies between health and the environment. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Not About Sufficiency
Between control and confrontation: The pitfalls and potential of corporate-community participatory development in Africa's energy and extractive industries,"The Cold War inadvertently led to the formation of two human rights treaties – with specific civil rights being encouraged by the West and participatory rights by the East. These participatory rights have found their voice in resource governance in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is due to lack of socio-economic infrastructure, corruption, and the weak or non-existent rule of law. Harnessing the benefits of extractive resources have been problematic, as the countries concerned failed to reap the benefits of the resources, and the development of the resources triggered violent conflicts, destroyed the environment, exacerbated inequalities across gender and geography, displaced communities, and undermined democratic governance. This article examines the fundamental questions about community participation in decision-making processes that have long-term environmental, economic, and social impacts on the community. Using context case studies, the article investigates the building blocks of effective participation in development projects in Africa. The critical questions asked are: Who delineates the contested space of participation and how are multiple layers of organized participation adopted? The potential for participatory development mechanisms as an inducement to encourage local community participation in resource governance is examined. Encouraging participation is indispensable for achieving environmental justice in vulnerable, resource-rich zones. © 2022",Not About Sufficiency

Exploring the effects of climate change and government stability on internal conflicts: evidence from selected sub-Saharan African countries,"Climate change has been linked to water scarcity, land degradation, and food insecurity, exacerbating existing tensions and creating new conflicts in countries with weak political institutions. Despite the critical need for effective conflict management and climate adaptation measures, prior studies failed to emphasize the role climate change plays in civil clashes in conflict-affected countries. In this research, we undertake a comprehensive investigation of the effects of climate change and government stability on internal conflicts in 14 selected SSA nations between 1996 and 2016. The study embraces contemporary heterogeneous panel techniques to address heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence issues that usually appear in panel data estimates. We employed second-generation unit root tests, such as CADF and CIPS, to determine the order of integration of the variables. In addition, Pedroni and Westerlund cointegration tests confirmed the long-run relationship among the variables. Although temperatures were insignificant, the long-run results of the pooled mean group (PMG) approach suggested that civil conflicts decline when precipitation increases. In addition, the outcomes indicate that environmental degradation and population growth are long-run aggravators of social unrest. The short-run results suggest that rising temperatures exacerbate civil conflicts in the selected SSA countries. However, the study found that government stability lessens internal conflicts in the short run, but not in the long run. The DOLS technique validated the long-run outcomes of the PMG technique. Based on the findings of the study, conflict-prone SSA countries should integrate climate change adaptation and conflict prevention strategies, implement sustainable water resource management practices, and endorse climate-related conflict resolution. © 2023.

Steering the global partnership for oceans,"The Global Partnership for Oceans (GPO) is an alliance of governments, private firms, international organizations, and civil society groups that aims to promote ocean health while contributing to human wellbeing. A Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP) was commissioned to develop guiding principles for GPO investments. Here we offer commentary on the BRP report from scholars in multiple disciplines that study the oceans: environmental economics, environmental politics, fisheries science, physical oceanography, and political economy. The BRP is a prominent, unique group of individuals representing diverse interests of GPO partners. We applaud the call for knowledge creation, but identify diverse issues that the BRP omitted: the need for effective governance to address data-poor stocks so that gaps do not dictate solutions; the deployment of projects that facilitate learning about governance effectiveness through program evaluation; and the importance of large-scale coordination of data collection in furthering the BRP's call for capacity building. Commenters' opinions are mixed on the likely impact of the report's recommendations on ocean health, governance, and economic development, but they highlight several key features of the report. A centerpiece of the report that distinguishes it from most previous high-level reports on the oceans is the prominence given to human well-being. The report emphasizes the commons problem as a critical institutional failure that must be addressed and focuses heavily on market-based mechanisms to improve governance. The report successfully acknowledges tradeoffs-across different stakeholders as well as across human well-being and ocean health-but there is little specific guidance on how to make these tradeoffs. Historical tensions among GPO partners run deep, and resolving them will require more than high-level principles. For instance, it is unclear how to resolve the potential conflict between proprietary data and the report's stated desire for transparency and open access to information. Some differences may ultimately be irreconcilable. The report appropriately advocates flexibility for the GPO to adapt solutions to particulars of a problem, avoiding the trap of one size fits all. However, flexibility is also a weakness because the BRP does not provide guidance on how best to approach problems that span multiple scales. Some scales may be beyond the scope of the GPO; for example, the GPO cannot meaningfully contribute to global climate change mitigation. Nevertheless, the GPO could play an important role in climate adaptation by facilitating the development of governance regimes that are resilient to climate-induced species migrations.",Not About Sufficiency
"Parks, protected areas and local populations: New international issues and imperatives","Over the past decade, the protection of natural areas has acquired a new urgency, even as the concepts underlying park protection have undergone significant change and evolution. Several emergent issues have added to this sense of urgency: the recognition that the earth's biological diversity is rapidly being depleted as critical habitats are permanently lost, the increasing rapidity of tropical deforestation, of concern in connection with both biological diversity and climate change due to the ""greenhouse effect"", and the emergence of concern for sustainable economic development in the Third World. The experience of park managers around the world over this same period has led to new imperatives in accommodating a variety of human needs in park planning and management. A new way of thinking about the goals and objectives of parks in many of the world's nations is emerging, and many experienced observers report that these new concepts are critical if existing parks are to remain protected and if new protected areas are to succeed in achieving their goals. These new concepts and imperatives emerge clearly from the papers on local population interactions with national parks and equivalent reserves presented at the June 1988 Second Symposium on Social Science in Resource Management at the University of Illinois. © 1990.",Not About Sufficiency

This study’s motivation stems from the escalating levels of air pollution worldwide, especially in regions with high concentrations of PM2.5 pollution. This study investigates the linkage between PM2.5 air pollution and its economic determinants like gross domestic product (GDP), foreign direct investment (FDI), renewable energy usage, population, and total natural resource rents in 80 nations with high air pollution. The study utilizes data from the World Bank and covers the period from 2010 to 2022. The initial non-spatial analysis utilizes cross-section fixed effect and random effect models. The study employed the Spatial Durbin and Spatial Autoregressive models to capture the impacts of spatial spillovers. The findings demonstrate a detrimental association between PM2.5 air pollution and GDP, and renewable energy. In contrast, FDI, population expansion, and revenue from natural resources contribute to the increase in air pollution. The evidence suggests that for every 1% increase in population, there is an average increase of 0.25% in PM2.5 air pollution. The findings also indicate that PM2.5 air pollution originating from one country spreads to adjacent nations. The analysis of Local Moran’s I reveal geographical clustering patterns in PM2.5 air pollution and renewable energy usage. Policy recommendations emphasize the need to promote renewable energy sources to reduce air pollution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Not About Sufficiency

WHO wants to integrate protection and promotion of quality of life with economic growth.Reproductive health was one of the topics of the 3-day meeting. Poverty, unemployment, and social disintegration were considered to be linked in a vicious circle. The summit will require national and international commitments to actions that will alleviate poverty and adverse social conditions caused by economic policies and growth, and to measures that support social development, including reproductive health and family planning services.",Not About Sufficiency
