Social Equity and Environmental Risk,"Social equity has become an important concern of the environmental movement over the past decade. The equity issue is analyzed here for practically all of the inactive hazardous waste disposal sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) regulated under the Comprehensive Response Compensation and Liability Act and its 1986 Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (CERCLA/ SARA). Two dimensions of equity are emphasized, namely, site location relative to the location of minority populations and the distribution of cleanup plans or Records of Decision (ROD) across communities with NPL sites that have different socioeconomic characteristics. With respect to site location, the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics aggregated at the Census Place or MCD level in communities with NPL sites was greater than is typical nationwide (largely attributable to the concentration of minority populations in a few large urban areas with NPL sites). In contrast, the percentage of the population below the poverty line in communities with NPL sites largely matched that of the nation as a whole. With respect to site cleanup, communities with relatively higher percentages of racial minority populations have fewer cleanup plans (Records of Decision signed) than other communities with NPL sites. Whether a ROD exists is influenced by when the site was designated for the NPL: sites designated earlier (prior to the SARA amendments of 1986) are more likely to have RODs, and also less likely to have high proportions of racial minority populations than sites designated later. This implies that initially the designation process may have resulted in NPL sites being located disproportionately in minority areas, but this pattern seems to be reversing itself in more recently designated sites. As with any statistical analysis, these findings are findings of association and not causality. Thus, racial and ethnic disproportionalities with respect to inactive hazardous waste site location seem to be concentrated in a relatively few areas. Disproportionalities with respect to cleanup do exist, but appear to be more a function of the nature of the process of designation of NPL sites in the early 1980s rather than a result of actions connected with cleanup plans per se. Further investigations are needed at alternative geographic scales to discern the sensitivity of patterns of inequity to distance from the sites. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Decarbonization will lead to more equitable air quality in California,"Air quality associated public health co-benefit may emerge from climate and energy policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the distribution of these co-benefits has not been carefully studied, despite the opportunity to tailor mitigation efforts so they achieve maximum benefits within socially and economically disadvantaged communities (DACs). Here, we quantify such health co-benefits from different long-term, low-carbon scenarios in California and their distribution in the context of social vulnerability. The magnitude and distribution of health benefits, including within impacted communities, is found to varies among scenarios which reduce economy wide GHG emissions by 80% in 2050 depending on the technology- and fuel-switching decisions in individual end-use sectors. The building electrification focused decarbonization strategy achieves ~15% greater total health benefits than the truck electrification focused strategy which uses renewable fuels to meet building demands. Conversely, the enhanced electrification of the truck sector is shown to benefit DACs more effectively. Such tradeoffs highlight the importance of considering environmental justice implications in the development of climate mitigation planning.Air quality is found to be more equitable through two salient decarbonization pathways for California in 2050 with the relative justice of decarbonization scenarios quantified at the neighborhood level and the tradeoffs between pathways evaluated.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment and Optimization of Ecological Networks in Trans-Provincial Metropolitan Areas—A Case Study of the Xuzhou Metropolitan Area,"In the urbanization development trend, constructing inter-provincial metropolitan areas has gradually become an important pathway for China to implement its new urbanization strategy. Economic development in metropolitan areas inevitably leads to ecological degradation and fragmentation, threatening biodiversity. A reasonable assessment and optimization of the ecological network structure of inter-provincial metropolitan areas can effectively improve the stability of regional ecosystems and contribute to the sustainable development of urban and rural environments. In this study, we optimized the identification of ecological sources at the metropolitan area scale by constructing the ‘MIE’ model combined with the threshold analysis method, identified the core ecological sources in the Xuzhou Metropolitan Area, a typical cross-provincial metropolitan area in China, and then extracted the ecological corridors by using the Linkage Mapper tool based on this method. The spatiotemporal patterns and components of the ecological network of the Xuzhou metropolitan area from 1990 to 2020 were assessed, and an optimization analysis was performed based on the current ecological network. The results show that urban expansion has caused a decentralized layout of the ecological space in the study area across the provincial metropolitan area, with an uneven distribution of ecological sources and the development of ecological corridors in an east-dense and west-sparse pattern in 30 years. Increased interference by human activities has decreased the landscape dominance of the regional ecological resources and overall fragmentation of the habitats. The number of ecological corridors decreased, the average length of ecological corridors increased, the difficulty of biological flow increased, the connectivity of the ecological network structure decreased, and accessibility between source areas decreased. The α, β, and γ indices of the regional ecological network increased by 0.16, 0.46, and 0.1, respectively, after restoring important ecological sources and corridors. This study provides a framework for ecological network assessment and optimization in cross-provincial metropolitan areas, which is of great significance for studying metropolitan areas at similar stages of development.",Not About Sufficiency
Examining the Effects of Land Use on Carbon Emissions: Evidence from Pearl River Delta,"Land-use change accounts for a large proportion of the carbon emissions produced each year, especially in highly developed urban agglomerations. In this study, we combined remote sensing data and socioeconomic data to estimate land-use-related carbon emissions, and applied the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method to analyze its influencing factors, in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of China in 1990-2015. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The total amount of land-use-related carbon emissions increased from 684.84 × 104 t C in 1990 to 11,444.98 × 104 t C in 2015, resulting in a net increase of 10,760.14 × 104 t (16.71 times).

"A Simulation-Based Prediction of Land Use Change Impacts on Carbon Storage from a Regional Imbalance Perspective: A Case Study of Hunan Province, China","Land use imbalances are a critical driving factor contributing to regional disparities in carbon storage (CS). As a significant component of China’s Yangtze River Economic Belt, Hunan Province has undergone substantial shifts in land use types, resulting in an uneven distribution of ecosystem CS and sequestration capacity. Therefore, within the framework of the “dual carbon” strategy, examining the effects of land use changes driven by regional resource imbalances on CS holds practical importance for advancing regional sustainable development. This study focuses on Hunan Province, utilizing the PLUS-InVEST model to assess the spatiotemporal evolution of CS under land use changes from 1990 to 2020. Additionally, multiple scenario-based development modes were employed to predict county-level CS. The results indicate the following: (1) From 1990 to 2020, Hunan Province experienced continuous urban expansion, with forest land and cultivated land, which are core ecological land types, being converted into construction land. (2) Over these 30 years, the province’s total CS increased by 2.47 × 108 t, with significant spatial differentiation. High-value zones were concentrated in bands along the province’s borders, while lower values were observed in the central and northern regions. The highest CS values were recorded in forested areas at the province’s periphery, whereas the lowest values were observed in the northern water bodies. (3) The scenario-based predictions revealed notable differences, with the ecological protection scenario demonstrating a substantial carbon sink effect. By prioritizing forest and cultivated land, CS could be maximized. This research provides valuable insights for enhancing CS and optimizing land use structures in regions facing resource imbalances.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring Sustainable Development and the SDGs 3, 4, and 8 Using the Carbon Intensity of Human Well-Being and Longitudinal Multilevel Modeling","Multilevel modeling statistics for longitudinal examination to explore the connections, relatedness, and interdependency of SDG3 “Good Health and Well-being”, SDG4 “Quality Education”, and economic growth SDGs 8 “Decent Work and Economic Growth” at a country level over the period 2000–2020. This is a novel approach that incorporates “nested” or “hierarchically nested” observations. Health and well-being, as measured in this study by the carbon intensity of human well-being (CIWB), was positively linked to economic growth and is a production function of sustainability. Results indicate that countries investing in the promotion of health and well-being outcomes will increase their economic growth over the long term. In contrast to previous studies, the relationship between education and economic growth was insignificant with the caveat of the indicators chosen. Using the advanced statistical methods adopted here could offer policymakers new insights and tools to focus their efforts to accelerate the progress of sustainable development and achieve the SDG targets by 2030.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating Circular Economy and Laudato Si’: A Christian Framework for Sustainable Development and Environmental Stewardship,"The circular economy and Laudato Si’ share a common vision for addressing environmental, ecological, and social challenges through sustainability, justice, and paradigm change. The circular economy moves beyond the linear “take-make-dispose” model by promoting resource efficiency, waste elimination, and the regeneration of natural systems. Similarly, Laudato Si’ calls for integral ecology, recognizing the interconnectedness of environmental, social, economic, and cultural systems. Both emphasize practical actions, such as transitioning to renewable energy, promoting responsible waste management, and adopting regenerative agricultural practices to restore our ecosystems. Ethical consumption, simplicity, and moderation are central to both frameworks, encouraging shifts toward reuse, repair, and shared resources as common platforms to reduce overconsumption. Social justice remains a priority, with a focus on supporting marginalized populations unequally affected by ecological crises. Education and international cooperation are essential to achieving these goals, fostering ecological awareness, and coordinating policies to drive systemic change. The circular economy and Laudato Si’ provide a transformative pathway to restore harmony between humanity, nature, and society by promoting balance, equity, and sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
"Global perspective of municipal solid waste and landfill leachate: generation, composition, eco-toxicity, and sustainable management strategies","Globally, more than 2 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) are generated each year, with that amount anticipated to reach around 3.5 billion tonnes by 2050. On a worldwide scale, food and green waste contribute the major proportion of MSW, which accounts for 44% of global waste, followed by recycling waste (38%), which includes plastic, glass, cardboard, and paper, and 18% of other materials. Population growth, urbanization, and industrial expansion are the principal drivers of the ever-increasing production of MSW across the world. Among the different practices employed for the management of waste, landfill disposal has been the most popular and easiest method across the world. Waste management practices differ significantly depending on the income level. In high-income nations, only 2% of waste is dumped, whereas in low-income nations, approximately 93% of waste is burned or dumped. However, the unscientific disposal of waste in landfills causes the generation of gases, heat, and leachate and results in a variety of ecotoxicological problems, including global warming, water pollution, fire hazards, and health effects that are hazardous to both the environment and public health. Therefore, sustainable management of MSW and landfill leachate is critical, necessitating the use of more advanced techniques to lessen waste production and maximize recycling to assure environmental sustainability. The present review provides an updated overview of the global perspective of municipal waste generation, composition, landfill heat and leachate formation, and ecotoxicological effects, and also discusses integrated-waste management approaches for the sustainable management of municipal waste and landfill leachate.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Carbon Taxes and Carbon Tax Recovery on the Chinese Economy: A Green Technological Progress Perspective,"Environmental challenges, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), pose significant threats to global sustainability. Sustainability requires achieving economic growth and social progress while minimizing environmental degradation, improving resource efficiency, and ensuring long-term ecological balance. At present, many studies have shown that carbon taxes may negatively impact the economy. However, environmental regulations also drive firms to pursue green technological innovations, thereby promoting progress. Previous studies on the regulatory measure of carbon taxes have often overlooked the potential influence of green technological progress on economic outcomes. To address these gaps, our research selected panel data from 30 provinces in China, spanning from 2005 to 2021, and employed the System Generalized Method of Moments (SYS-GMM) to evaluate the effect of carbon taxes on green total factor productivity (GTFP) and green total factor energy efficiency (GTFEE). The regression results, representing the green technological progress coefficient, are then incorporated into the China Energy-Environment-Economic Analysis 2.0 (CEEEA2.0) model. We also add carbon tax recovery to this model in order to analyze their economic impact from the new perspective of green technological progress. The SYS-GMM findings suggest that carbon taxes positively impact GTFP and GTFEE, with impact coefficients of 7.2% and 3.4%, respectively. The CEEEA2.0 model reveals that, without considering green technological progress, the introduction of carbon taxes negatively impacts the economy. However, this impact may turn into a positive one when green technological progress is considered. Additionally, carbon tax recovery measures help mitigate economic losses or enhance gains. Overall, this study offers a fresh perspective for modeling carbon tax implementation and holds both theoretical and practical significance and provides actionable insights into designing carbon tax policies that balance economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring Inequality: A Multi-Scale Analysis of China’s Consumption Carbon Footprint,"Carbon emission inequality has become a critical factor constraining the coordinated development of socio-economic systems and the natural environment. This inequality exacerbates the disparity in carbon emissions across regions, hindering efforts to achieve sustainable development and environmental justice. Previous research has primarily focused on the structure of carbon footprints and their influencing factors, but there has been limited quantitative research on carbon emission inequality, particularly from a multi-scale perspective. This study constructs a 250 m-high-resolution consumption-based carbon footprint grid for China and uses the Theil index to reveal significant spatial inequalities in carbon footprints. The results indicate that smaller-scale analyses better reveal the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of carbon footprints within regions. At the county level, carbon footprints exhibit significant inequalities, with hotspots concentrated in regions such as Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta. The top 5% of areas with the highest carbon footprints (139 cities) contributed 19.6% of the national total, indicating a concentration in a few large cities. The decomposition of the Theil index shows that county-level cities contributed 55% of the national carbon inequality. The study also reveals the complex relationship between carbon footprints and income, as well as urban-rural disparities. The underdeveloped central and western regions exhibit a pronounced spatial lag effect, with the growth rate of carbon footprints in rural areas surpassing that of urban areas. Carbon footprints in impoverished areas and inter-provincial marginal areas overlap significantly with low-emission zones, demonstrating characteristics of “low-carbon growth”. To achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets, China must adopt comprehensive measures to reduce carbon footprints and their inequalities, including strengthening multi-scale carbon inequality monitoring, implementing differentiated carbon reduction policies, and promoting coordinated emission reduction development at the county level.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatio-temporal variations of the land-use-related carbon budget in Southeast China: the evidence of Fujian province,"The attainment of a regionally balanced carbon budget is fundamental for the realization of carbon neutrality. This study involved the quantification of the carbon budget related to land use across Southeast China from 2005 to 2020, which was achieved through the calculation of both carbon emissions and carbon sinks. Subsequently, we scrutinized the mechanisms driving the observed dynamic changes in the carbon budget, pinpointed the impact of land-use efficiency (LUE) on the carbon budget, and proposed sustainable spatial planning and management strategies for diverse functional areas at the county level. The core findings are as follows: The dynamics of the carbon budget were spatially heterogeneous, characterized by a gradual increase in carbon emissions over time, while carbon sinks remained relatively constant. The Gini coefficient (G) manifested a gradual increase throughout the study period, reflecting an imbalanced evolution between carbon sinks and emissions. There was also an observable imbalance in the distribution of the carbon ecological carrying coefficient between coastal and inland regions. Land-use-related carbon emissions demonstrated a substantial spatial spillover effect, whereas a weak spatial spillover effect was noted in land-use-related carbon sinks. The correlation between LUE and the carbon budget varied significantly across different functional areas, as the driving effects of LUE displayed remarkable spatial heterogeneity. A quantification of the spatio-temporal alterations and the driving mechanisms behind the carbon budget can aid in the advancement of urban sustainability and regional carbon neutrality.",Not About Sufficiency
Explore Associations between Subjective Well-Being and Eco-Logical Footprints with Fixed Effects Panel Regressions,"As environmental degradations constantly and directly threaten human well-being, it is imperative to explore the environmental impacts on people’s happy life. This research investigates the association between subjective well-being (SWB) and ecological footprints (EF) through space-time fixed effects panel regressions. EF, as a vital indicator of environmentally sustainable development, plays a vital role in ecological balance. SWB determines the subjective quality of life for humanity. EF-related factors and socio-economic indexes referring to GDP, urbanization rate, income, education, health, political stability, and political voice accountability in 101 countries were captured. Compared with ordinary least square (OLS), stepwise regression (SR) and fixed effects panel regression models (FEPR) exhibited good fitness regardless of the cross-section or longitudinal models due to R2 beyond 0.9. The finding also discloses that EF and health were positively significant to SWB, while income was negatively significant to SWB. EF was an invert u-shaped link to SWB, which met the assumption of EKC.

Would an increasing block carbon tax be better? A comparative study within the Stackelberg Game framework,"Carbon tax is a policy for controlling carbon emissions, and is widely used worldwide. However, a non-differentiated carbon tax increases financial burden on manufacturers and inhibits their willingness to produce. Herein, a novel carbon tax policy involving an increasing block carbon tax is proposed, and the policy's possible implementation effects are analyzed. First, based on the Stackelberg game, the study constructs a social welfare model considering carbon emissions. Then, the study discusses the theoretical characteristics of the proposed carbon tax policy. After that, the differences and similarities between a flat carbon tax and an increasing block carbon tax are analyzed using a numerical simulation. The results indicate that: (1) compared to flat carbon tax, an increasing block carbon tax has the same controlling effect on carbon emissions. Both forms of taxes can restrict total carbon emissions within the desired range. (2) An increasing block carbon tax policy can significantly reduce tax burdens for manufacturers, and encourages low-carbon production. (3) An increasing block carbon tax can flexibly adjust the relationship between government's carbon tax revenue and manufacturer's tax burden.

A 1940-2020 spatiotemporal analysis of thermal discomfort days in Southeast Asian countries,"The high temperature and humidity make Southeast Asia (SEA) one of the regions most susceptible to the occurrence of thermal discomfort days (TDDs) in the world. In the context of global warming, SEA’s rapid population growth and urban expansion further exacerbated the region’s exposure to TDD, posing greater risks in public health. However, there exists a significant knowledge gap in the understanding of the long-term spatiotemporal evolution of TDD, as well as its projection in the future. By utilizing the newly released ERA5 datasets of Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) and Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT), this study presented the 81-year analysis of TDDs in SEA countries, spanning from 1940 to 2020, with projections extending to 2100. While the mean increase in UTCI was relatively modest, the corresponding rise in TDD likelihood was disproportionately larger, indicating a heightened risk of exposure. A distinct contrast was observed between continental and maritime regions, with maritime countries showing smaller absolute rises in both indices but larger trends in TDD frequency due to oceanic moderating effects. Seasonal analyses highlighted the dominant influence of the East Asia monsoon over SEA, and spatial analyses revealed a negative correlation between TDD occurrence and elevation, with low-lying areas being hotspots. Projections for 2050 suggest continued warming. These findings underscore the urgency of proactive measures to address climate change impacts, particularly in vulnerable maritime and low-lying areas, providing valuable insights for enhancing climate resilience and adaptation in SEA. Our findings reveal critical insights into the trends and future scenarios of thermal discomfort in the region, underscoring the urgent need for effective climate adaptation strategies.",Not About Sufficiency
Public perception of transitioning to a low-carbon nation: a Malaysian scenario,"Efforts such as the Glasgow United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties 26, the Paris Agreement (Paris agreement, United Nations, Paris, 2015) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are supporting the drive to protect the planet from global warming by ensuring sustainable development. The oil and gas industry, as key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, must transition to more sustainable energy solutions and play their part in reducing these emissions. Currently, oil and gas companies are implementing technical solutions to achieve net zero carbon emissions. The energy transition from fossil fuel reliance has also happened by exploiting alternative renewable energy sources to meet global energy demand such as wind, solar, biogas and bioderived feedstocks. This net zero energy transition will require a fair and just transition for all in society, and to implement this, it is crucial for those working in the oil and gas industry to understand the technologies needed, the importance of carbon policies and their roles. This research presents a modified Delphi study of employees in Malaysia's national oil and gas company to understand their perceptions towards a net-zero carbon future. The paper briefly reviews Malaysia's low-carbon policy plans, its current carbon dioxide accounting balance, and identifies potential technologies for decarbonisation to set the scene for the modified Delphi study. The results indicated that the national oil and gas company has both the capabilities and the financial resources to significantly contribute towards Malaysia transitioning to a carbon neutral nation. This can be achieved by implementing advanced technologies complementing with nature-based solutions to realise net zero carbon emissions. This study also portrays the confidence that the portfolio of solutions should be executed through a coordinated effort to maximise the outcome and minimise the financial impact in terms of economical sustainability. Implementation of activities towards this energy transition will require significant social commitment, and hence, gauging their perception towards this journey is key objective of this paper.",Not About Sufficiency
Winning coalitions for just transitions: Insights from the environmental justice movement,"In recent years, attention within the sustainability transitions literature has focused on the politics of deliberately accelerating sustainability transitions.

Wind power! Marketing renewable energy on tribal lands and the struggle for just sustainability,"Using a case study approach and employing the critical framework of just sustainability, this article examines the ambivalent intersections of marketing and social/environmental justice as articulated through the public rhetoric of corporate entities that promote renewable energy generated on American Indian tribal lands. Because of its critical interest in the empowerment of disenfranchised communities through a shift away from traditional ways of valuing environmental sustainability and economic activity, just sustainability provides a valuable frame through which to interrogate not only articulations of economic development but also the use of popular American Indian archetypes like ""the Ecological Indian"" in the marketing of sustainable energy. We suggest that both our corporate case studies, NativeEnergy, which markets carbon offsets to clients, and the public utility company San Diego Gas and Electric, demonstrate efforts to advance many of the goals of just sustainability, and are successful in some respects, but fall short in others.

Health in global biodiversity governance: what is next?,"Environmental degradation contributes substantially to the global burden of disease and concurrent global environmental changes are increasingly recognised as public health threats, worldwide.1 The 196 parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) have called for increased engagement on biodiversity and health since 2014,2 while calls from stakeholders for integrated decision making are similarly long standing.3 Yet few civil society health organisations have historically engaged with the CBD and its intergovernmental negotiating process.4 This situation is, however, changing.Elements of other COP 15 outcomes5 are also relevant to the health community and to steering health civil society organisation priorities, including separate decisions5 on climate change, biocultural diversity, food systems and soil biodiversity, and synthetic biology.[...]health experts can bolster the health dimension of environmental impact assessments, national ecosystem assessments, and strategic environmental assessments, and ensure their inclusion in decision making.25 The full environmental footprint, including planetary pressures from material use and waste, biodiversity loss, and carbon dioxide emissions, must be estimated for the health sector and addressed.26,27 As emphasised in the GBF, health professionals also need to strengthen their roles in efforts to expand interdisciplinary biodiversity education, and integrate holistic biodiversity–health approaches into national biodiversity and health plans.28 CBD COP 16 will take place in Türkiye in 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Will the circle be unbroken? The climate mitigation and sustainable development given by a circular economy of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and water","Closing the loop in the flow of C, nutrients and water between agriculture, the human diet and sanitation services offers benefits for humanity across multiple platforms of public health, food security and climate mitigation. This study assesses these benefits by describing the hypothetical scenario of a global, 'fully functional' circular economy, in which 100% of C, N and P were recovered from human excreta and returned to agricultural soil. Crop nutrient demand is calculated and compared with that which could be recovered, and greenhouse (GHG) emissions from fertilizer production, fertilizer application and sanitation services are presented, as are freshwater availability and crop irrigation requirements. These are considered to analyse the broader effects of this circular economy that is driven by dietary nutrition demand on climate change, the provision of sanitation services and crop irrigation, in 2022 and with projections to 2030 and 2050. We find the capacity of the circular economy to deliver crop nutrients and mitigate GHG emissions varies by region. Some regions benefit from supplementing conventional mineral fertilizers with excreta-derived fertilizers, others from reducing GHG emissions from sanitation services through improved resource recovery rates. A hypothetical, fully functional circular economy that recovers all excreta nutrient C, N and P would reduce global GHG emissions from N and P mineral fertilizer production and application by 140 Tg CO2 equivalents (CO2 e) per year in 2022 (similar to 12% of total emissions from mineral fertilizer production and application) and provide a maximum of 104 Tg C per year for sequestration in global cropland (similar to 12% of estimated annual soil C sequestration potential). A portion of this sequestered C will return to the atmosphere via soil respiration, however, with co-benefits to other soil functions such as crop nutrient fertility. The maximum potential reduction in GHG emissions from sanitation services through these measures would bring reductions of 445 Tg CO2 e per year in 2022, rising to 562 Tg CO2 e in 2050. Our results provide evidence to guide specific regional policy on reducing GHG emissions, offsetting mineral fertilizer use and optimizing municipal water use using the circular economy. Closing the loop in the flow of C, nutrients and water between agriculture, the human diet and sanitation services offers benefits for humanity across multiple platforms of public health, food security and climate mitigation.",Not About Sufficiency

"The Circular Economy of the Food Bank Supply Chain in Bandung City, West Java","Food banks play a crucial role in reducing food waste and addressing food vulnerability. Their operations involve an efficient supply chain that collects surplus food, processes it, and distributes it to those in need. This aligns with the goals of a circular economy, aiming to minimize food crises. This research aims to understand the supply chain of the Food Bank Bandung and analyze the implementation of circular economy principles within its supply chain. The study employs qualitative methods, with data gathered through interviews conducted with representatives from the Food Bank located in Bandung City. The collected information was used to design a comprehensive supply chain model, which was then meticulously analyzed. The analysis reveals that the Food Bank in Bandung effectively implements a circular economy by transforming surplus food, which would otherwise go to waste, into consumable items. Furthermore, the food bank adopts circular economy concepts by providing inedible food to Black Soldier Fly (BSF) cultivation for maggot consumption, which then can be used as an alternative source of protein for animal feed. The findings of the study show how circular economy practices can be integrated into food bank operations. By analyzing the circular economy approach in the Food Bank of Bandung, this research contributes to the existing body of knowledge and provides a foundation for future studies, offering a more extensive dataset for researchers and practitioners in the field.",Not About Sufficiency
Why policy coherence in the European Union matters for global sustainability,"The global economy is producing unequal economic exchanges between countries, including illegitimate transfer of wealth from low-income countries, which ultimately undermine efforts towards securing robust social welfare systems. This puts policies on trade and finance, corporate governance and circular economy at the centre of the global development puzzle. Policy coherence for development must be understood in the context of the tension between the overarching societal goal of achieving sustainability and the functioning of the global economy. In this article, we focus on the political and legal challenges this puzzle presents, using the case of European Union policies on business, finance and circular economy, which have global impacts. We see these as core areas of law and policy where advances are made but which need to be better positioned within an overarching aim of sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Who's fighting for justice?: advocacy in energy justice and just transition scholarship,"Recent political, economic and policy change in the US, Australia, and Europe, in particular, have put transitions towards low-carbon energy futures at the forefront of local and national policy agendas. How these transitions are managed is likely to affect the feasibility, timing and scope of transition policy. Recognizing the existing maldistribution of the benefits and burdens of fossil fuel-based extraction, energy generation, and distribution, advocates and scholars increasingly call for policies that not only support decarbonization goals, but also those of equity. Proposals that do not contain such goals may be met with resistance. This review examines the politics of achieving more just outcomes by asking, what is our current understanding of justice advocacy and the impacts of such advocacy on the energy transition? In this study, we systematically review articles that include the key concepts of 'just transition' or 'energy justice' and that examine advocacy in energy transition contexts. We find advocates from diverse communities and affiliated with varied organizational types are involved in advocacy. Diverse issues motivate advocates and the most common advocate type in the literature are residents that are affected by local impacts of energy transition decisions. Extra-institutional tactics are the most common means of advocate action. We also find that advocacy is often motivated by issues related to decision-making processes and environmental degradation. These findings illuminate that: (a) energy systems and transitions are governed by processes and institutions that are often inaccessible, (b) advocates often attempt to affect change using tactics external to such processes and institutions, and (c) issues of environmental degradation are often prominent in advocacy discourse concerning the energy transition. Future research should seek to more clearly determine advocates' primary motivations and the tactics and actions that ultimately aid or hinder more equitable outcomes.",Not About Sufficiency

Which states will lead a just transition for the Arctic? A DeePeR analysis of global data on Arctic states and formal observer states,"A fair and equitable low carbon future depends on a just transition which, in turn, requires leadership. Where the Arctic is concerned, this leadership is currently lacking. To gauge which states are most likely to provide leadership in the global energy transition, a quantitative rank-percentile assessment of 21 Arctic Council members and Observer states was conducted, using measures relevant to the just transition. Data from multiple open-access sources were combined, creating a model to 'evaluate energy and equity aspects of Distributional, Procedural and Restorative' justice (DeePeR). Results suggest normative leadership on a just transition for the Arctic comprises international climate contributions in line with carbon emission records and a commitment to both fair and green jobs.

Which countries are more ecologically efficient in improving human well-being? An application of the Index of Ecological Well-being Performance,"In today's world, improving the efficiency of transforming ecological consumption into human well-being is a necessary condition for humanity as a whole to achieve higher levels of well-being within ecological limits. In this paper, the Index of Ecological Well-being Performance (IEWP) is defined and constructed to measure the efficiency of transforming ecological consumption into human well-being and to determine which countries are more ecologically efficient in improving human well-being. As an efficiency measure, the main mission of the IEWP is to urge and stimulate countries to improve human well-being in an ecologically efficient way. The Human Development Index (measuring human well-being) and the Ecological Footprint (measuring ecological consumption) are employed to construct the IEWP. An empirical IEWP analysis of 82 countries with a population larger than 10 million in 2012 demonstrates that the developed countries (except Romania) and the G20 countries (except India and Indonesia) are generally less ecologically efficient in improving human well-being. To make national well-being improvement not only ecologically efficient but also equitable, several suggestions are proposed regarding respective responsibilities for global ecological sustainability in the process of improving IEWP performance for countries with different ecological conditions and development stages.",Not About Sufficiency
Where the power lies: Developing a political ecology framework for just energy transition,"This critical review lays down the fundamentals for rethinking just energy transition. It reviews the theoretical perspectives of energy justice, socio-technical transitions (STTs), and political ecology and presents a plausible and useful way to approach a just low-carbon transition using Political Ecology as a broad framework. This Political Ecology framework for Sustainable Energy Transition (PESET) addresses power issues associated with low-carbon transition, while also identifying the role of inclusivity and justice in low-carbon transition. As energy transition studies have primarily focused on the Global North and the extraction and production of large technologies, this framework provides a more radical means to achieve just transition objectives with particular relevance for application in the Global South-a region largely overlooked in transitions scholarship and where mundane/simple technologies (e.g. Solar Home Systems and clean cookstoves) typify transitions processes to date. The PESET framework presents a novel contribution, linking the concepts of energy justice, STTs, and political ecology to provide a more comprehensive means of framing and analysing just energy transitions. It thus provides a novel overarching framework linking energy studies, sustainability transitions, development studies and innovation studies especially in an era where the globe is moving toward a clean and affordable energy for all (Sustainable Development Goal 7).",Not About Sufficiency
The ethics of burden-sharing in the global greenhouse,The Kyoto Protocol on global warming has provoked great controversy in part because it calls for heavier burdens on wealthy countries than on developing countries in the effort to control climate change. The U.S. Senate voted unanimously to oppose any agreement that does not require emissions reductions in low-income countries. The ethics of this position are examined in this paper which shows that there are good moral reasons for supporting the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol. Such a conclusion follows easily from considerations of distributive justice but can also be supported by more narrowly self-interested arguments.,Not About Sufficiency
Call for multi-policy approach: Synergistic effects of emissions trading scheme and energy efficiency policies,"Limited research exists on the synergistic effects of carbon emissions trading and energy efficiency policies despite their significance in achieving global carbon neutrality objectives. This study examines the synergistic effects of carbon emissions trading and energy efficiency policies on aspects of the environment, energy, and economy. Results show that the synergistic effect leads to an additional reduction of 1.2% in carbon emissions, along with a decrease of 4.2% in economic losses. Despite challenges like increased energy external dependency and carbon leakage, the synergistic effect shows a positive externality between policies, reducing the carbon intensity and marginal emission mitigation costs. Furthermore, these synergistic effects yield positive consequences for social welfare, particularly benefiting rural households and fostering equitable distribution of carbon mitigation benefits across societal groups. These findings underscore the importance of considering policy synergies between carbon emissions trading and energy efficiency policies to ensure the total effect of climate change mitigation strategies.Limited research exists on the synergistic effects of carbon emissions trading and energy efficiency policies despite their significance in achieving global carbon neutrality objectives.

Optimization of Land Use Patterns in a Typical Coal Resource-Based City Based on the Ecosystem Service Relationships of ‘Food–Carbon–Recreation’,"Imbalanced supplies and demands of ecosystem services (ESSD) can negatively affect human well-being. Optimizing land use patterns in cities and regions is, in fact, essential to mitigate this challenge and ensure sustainable development. In this context, the present study aims to analyze the supply and demand of food production services (FPs), carbon sequestration services (CSs), and recreation services (RSs) in a typical coal resource-based city (Huainan) in China. In addition, the main influencing factors and their driving mechanisms were further explored using the geographical detector (Geo-Detector) and multi-scale geographic weighted regression (MGWR) models. Future land use changes were also predicted under traditional and constrained development scenarios using the GeoSOS-FLUS model. The obtained results indicated that: (1) the comprehensive ecosystem service (ES) supply index decreased from 1.42 to 0.84, while the comprehensive demand index increased from 0.74 to 0.95 during the 2010–2020 period; (2) the urban and rural areas had spatial disparities; (3) changes in the construction, ecological, and cultivated land strongly impacted ES; (4) implementing constrained development scenarios can effectively protect the ecological land, control urban expansion, and improve the ESSD relationships in Huainan City.

Waste incinerators undermine clean energy goals,"A national clean energy standard, modeled upon existing state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards, has been proposed to decarbonize the U.S. electric grid. Most such state policies include municipal solid waste incineration as a form of ""renewable"" energy, despite incinerators' prominent contributions to air pollution, primarily in environmental justice communities. This study finds that incinerators emit more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity produced (1707 g CO2e/kWh) than any other power source (range: 2.4 to 991.1 g CO2e/kWh). They also emit more criteria air pollutants than replacement sources of energy, such as natural gas. Incineration's inclusion in ""renewable"" or ""clean"" energy standards is thus counterproductive, as they also divert more than $40 million in subsidies annually from cleaner energy sources. As the electric grid decarbonizes, these disparities will only grow. With most U.S. incinerators nearing their end of life, policy choices about their eligibility for subsidies may well decide whether they shut down or undertake expensive capital improvements to continue operating. Extending incinerators' operational lives by 20 years would result in excess emissions of up to 637.7 million tonnes CO2e, 61.9 million tonnes NOx, and 161,200 tonnes SO2. Conversely, a rapid shutdown of existing incinerators would help decarbonize the electric grid and reduce criteria air pollution, particularly in environmental justice communities, which are disproportionately burdened by environmental health hazards.",Not About Sufficiency
"Carbon Budget Assessment and Influencing Factors for Forest Enterprises in the Key State-Owned Forest Area of the Greater Khingan Range, Northeast China","Analyzing the spatial and temporal changes in the carbon budget and its influencing factors is the basis for formulating effective measures to reduce emissions and increase sinks. This study establishes a carbon budget assessment model for forest enterprises, calculating forest carbon stocks and enterprise emissions using volume-derived biomass and emission factor methods. The spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of carbon budgets for forest enterprises in the key state-owned forest area (2017–2021) were analyzed using various methods, including the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and hotspot analysis. Influencing factors are identified through correlation analysis and the optimal parameter geographical detector (OPGD), while their spatial-temporal variations and causal relationships are analyzed using the geographical and temporal weighted regression model (GTWR) and structural equation modeling (SEM). The carbon budget in the Greater Khingan Range state-owned forest area averaged 10.16 × 106 t CO2-eq from 2017 to 2021, showing a gradual upward trend. The average annual carbon budget of forest enterprises was 1.02 × 106 t CO2-eq, which was highest in the central regions and lowest in the periphery. Soil pH, forest area, and elevation are the primary factors. The interaction between paired factors enhances the explanatory power of their impact, and the effects of different influencing factors exhibit both positive and negative variations across forest enterprises. In addition, the middle-aged forest tending area and average annual precipitation positively influenced forest area and soil pH, indirectly enhancing the carbon budget through multifactor interactions. This research can enhance the understanding of the carbon budget in forest enterprises, providing scientific support for the ecological protection of state-owned forests and contributing to the development of sustainable forestry practices that indirectly benefit societal well-being and economic resilience.",Not About Sufficiency
"What do the sustainable development goals reveal, and are they sufficient for sustainable development?","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 represent the current perceptions of humans regarding understanding and monitoring development. Achieving all 17 goals simultaneously is unrealistic. Considering the interconnected nature of SDGs, identifying their critical dimensions, goals, indicators, and mutual relationships is necessary. In addition, with increasing reservations about the sustainability of SDGs, it is crucial to explore consistency across different dimensions to ensure policy coherence in maximizing synergies and minimizing trade-offs. Our study employed multiple factor analysis (MFA) and hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC) to investigate these issues and analyze the results based on the public value (PV) theory. The results indicated that the Human Development Index (HDI) and gross domestic product per capita (GDPP) constitute the first principal component (PC) and are determinants in differentiating country clusters. However, they contradict environmental indicators such as CO2 emissions per capita and ecological footprint gha per person (EFP) and have low synergy with the Happy Planet Index (HPI). Additionally, the relationships between income level, inequality, and environmental quality correspond to a combined Kuznets curve and an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Moreover, governance capacity has become increasingly crucial in sustainable development, particularly in the capability to prioritize different PVs in a timely and strategic manner. Finally, despite the novelty of EFP and HPI, they cannot reveal the entire development story.

The Impact of Economic Corridor and Tourism on Local Community's Quality of Life under One Belt One Road Context,"Economic corridors unlock new economic opportunities and tourism development in the region to achieve sustainable development goals. Green economic growth is conducive to environmental sustainability. Economic mega-projects of CPEC promote tourism that leads to communities’ well-being and better quality of life. Modern infrastructure development contributes significantly to economic growth and tourism activities. This study’s objectives emphasize exploring tourism and sustainable development pursuits under OBOR economic projects that open doors to improving residents' quality of life. The growing world is an eyewitness to a continuous rise in emissions and its severe consequences for humankind. It is necessary to show off the leading factors that result in tourism and economic activities causing environmental pollution rather than blame policymakers. Undoubtedly, many studies previously focused on demonstrating the influence of socio-economic factors that lead to better environmental quality. However, the empirical literature on tourism, social well-being, foreign direct investment, and the Environment in Belt and Road developed economies needed improvement. This research applied a series of advanced estimators that help demonstrate the study’s probable results. This study explores the role of Social well-being (HDI), tourism development, FDI, renewable energy, information & communication technology (ICT), and urbanization on CO2 emissions in Belt and Road (BRI) developed economies.Estimated results exhibited the significant contribution of ICT and renewable energy to sustainability. Besides, FDI contributes to emissions reduction after its threshold level. Conversely, urbanization and tourism activities contribute to environmental pollution. The study outcomes stated inverted/EKC U-shaped hypotheses related to specified economies. Finally, the analysis based on the D-H panel causality test constructs exciting results.The present study concludes that economic corridor plays a vital role in tourism development, the community’s well-being, and SDGs goals (sustainable development) impact on environmental safety.

Synergizing social sustainability and technological innovation for carbon neutrality in OECD economies,"Economies around the globe are pushing toward a society's sustainability perspectives and upgradation in technology to protect the environment from global warming and the depletion of energy supplies. This shift in perception is primarily intended to alter people's attitudes toward posterity. By integrating the theories of interactions between social and ecological systems and the environment Kuznets curve (EKC) framework, this study explores the impact of nonrenewable energy consumption, social sustainability, and technological innovation on CO₂ emissions across the Organization for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD) countries from 2001 through 2020. Based on the estimates of FMOLS, PARDL, and QARDL, the 10‐year CO2 emissions and gross domestic product projections are traced using the average growth rate for each country and an average value of independent variables. The findings of this study highlight the detrimental effect of nonrenewable energy consumption on CO₂ emissions, underscoring the urgency for sustainable energy alternatives. However, the positive role of social sustainability and technological innovation in curbing CO₂ emissions within OECD countries is equally significant. Accentuating the importance of social sustainability within this context, the study sheds light on the integral role that societal factors, such as education, public awareness, and social well‐being, play a substantial role in shaping sustainable practices.

The Impact of Energy Poverty Alleviation on Carbon Emissions in Countries along the Belt and Road Initiative,"Energy poverty and climate change are global challenges. While the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has fostered energy cooperation and alleviated energy poverty in BRI countries, its impact on climate change requires careful examination. This study investigates the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions in BRI countries and analyzes the underlying mechanisms. In particular, this study constructs an integrated energy poverty assessment framework that includes three dimensions of energy accessibility, cleanliness, and affordability and utilizes the entropy-TOPSIS method to assess the status of energy poverty in 70 BRI countries. Subsequently, an empirical analysis using the Gini index as an instrumental variable was conducted to explore the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions and the specific mechanisms. It is found that alleviating energy poverty in BRI countries will lead to an increase in per capita carbon emissions. However, improving energy cleanliness is effective in reducing per capita carbon emissions, while improving energy affordability has no significant impact on carbon emissions. This study shows that energy poverty alleviation and carbon emission reduction are two non-conflicting sustainable development goals. BRI countries can synergize energy poverty alleviation and carbon emissions reduction by focusing on clean energy development and providing energy subsidies.",Not About Sufficiency
Primary healthcare’s carbon footprint and sustainable strategies to mitigate its contribution: a scoping review,"BackgroundThe escalating climate crisis poses a significant threat to global public health. The healthcare sector, designed to protect human health is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and thus, a key driver of climate degradation. This paradox endangers both planetary and human health, making the decarbonization of healthcare, including primary care, critical. However, research on primary care’s contribution to emissions and strategies for mitigation remains limited.AimThis scoping review aimed to map how primary care contributes to healthcare’s environmental footprint and determine contributing factors. Additionally, it sought to identify existing and innovative strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of primary healthcare.MethodsA comprehensive strategy was developed to systematically search both published databases and grey literature. Key terms were identified and employed in the exploration of relevant databases and internet search engines.ResultsAn initial search yielded 246 published articles and 25 grey literature sources. 14 additional articles were included following forward and backward searching of prominent authors and key articles. After screening and full-text review, 39 articles and 12 reports/toolkits were included. The majority of sources were opinion pieces, with limited quantitative, observational, or qualitative studies.Primary care’s carbon footprint can be classified into clinical and non-clinical sources, with significant impacts from pharmaceuticals and inhaler propellant gases. Contributing factors include limited knowledge of emission sources, lack of awareness of sustainable practices, low prioritization of sustainability, barriers including ethical concerns and over-medicalization.Identified strategies to reduce emissions include decarbonization of patient care, increasing education and awareness, implementing non-clinical decarbonization efforts, and conducting more research to support sustainable initiatives. Developing metrics to track progress and securing policy supports to improve adoption and implementation were also highlighted as critical.ConclusionThe identification of sources of carbon hotspots in primary care is an essential precursor to enable the development of targeted decarbonization strategies. Decarbonizing primary care requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the underlying factors driving unsustainable practices. This would allow healthcare professionals to effectively balance the provision of high-quality patient care, while reducing their environmental impact, ultimately improving both human and planetary health.",Not About Sufficiency
Restorative Energy Justice,"While distributive justice and procedural justice have received substantial attention from energy scholars, recent work identifies restorative justice as an underdeveloped component of the energy justice framework. As conceived in the context of criminal law, restorative justice seeks to more precisely account for harms and obligations that arise from wrongdoing, and to widen the circle of participation in repairing those harms. Restorative environmental justice wields these principles to advance the environmental justice framework beyond a tight focus on disparate environmental and health impacts. Restorative energy justice faces the challenge of deploying this restorative approach in an energy landscape that is often tightly focused on technology choices and business concerns.In Hawai‘i, we find an opportunity to operationalize the concept of restorative energy justice. The origin of Hawai‘i’s regulated electricity industry is indelibly intertwined with the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. By incorporating a restorative approach that more fully considers the implications of those roots, energy regulators can better account for the future costs and benefits associated with Hawai‘i’s effort to decarbonize its electricity system. In turn, this improved accounting can reduce the risk that the urgency of decarbonization will be placed in a false tension with the imperative of justice.",Not About Sufficiency
Land Stewardship and Development Behaviors Under an Ecological-Impact-Weighted Land Value Tax Scheme: A Proof-of-Concept Agent-Based Model,"Sprawling land development patterns have exacerbated ecological degradation, social fragmentation, and public health problems. Perverse incentives arise from the ability to privatize collectively created value in land rents and socialize ecological costs. Land value taxation (LVT) has been shown to encourage urban infill development by reducing or eliminating rent-seeking behavior in land markets. However, despite its purported benefits, this tax reform is value monistic in its definition of optimal land use and, therefore, does little to address the lack of non-market information to inform land use decisions. We propose an ecological-impact-weighted land value taxation policy (ELVT) which incorporates the ecological footprint of land use into one’s land value tax burden. We test both proposed policies (LVT and ELVT) relative to a “status quo” (SQ) property tax scheme, utilizing a conceptual spatially explicit agent-based model of land use behaviors and housing development. Our findings suggest that both tax interventions can increase the capital intensity and decrease the land intensity of housing development. Furthermore, both tax interventions can lead to a net profit loss for speculators and a decrease in the average housing unit price. The ELVT scheme is shown to significantly increase urban nature provisions and dampen the loss of ecological value across a region.",Not About Sufficiency
Sea Level change: Environmental and socio-economic impacts,"The coast was among the first of the earth's environments to be subjected to human modification; modification that was both direct and indirect, as it is today. During the last 4.000 to 5.000 years, human impacts on the coast were at what was basically a stable sea level. Because many of the modifications were made to protect against unusual events such as typhoons and tsunami, humans developed a variety of techniques for protecting shorelines. Recent calculations that a rapid sea level rise (in response to greenhouse warming) is imminent, has prompted concerned efforts at meeting the socio-economic impacts that are likely to occur. These impacts, rather than being localized and temporary as has been true in the recent past, are likely to be universal and long-lasting. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Not About Sufficiency
Waiting for Godot? The case for climate change adaptation and mitigation in small island states,"Global warming is the most significant threat to ecosystems and people's health and living standards in the coming decades, especially in small island states in the Caribbean and elsewhere. This paper contributes to the debate by analyzing different options to scale up climate change mitigation and adaptation. In particular, the empirical analysis indicates that increasing energy efficiency and reducing the use of fossil fuel in electricity generation could lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions, while investing in physical and financial resilience would yield long-run benefits. From a risk-reward perspective, the advantages of reducing the risks associated with climate change and the health benefits from higher environmental quality clearly outweigh the potential cost of climate change mitigation and adaptation in the short run. The additional revenue generated by environmental taxes could be used to compensate the most vulnerable households, building a multilayered safety net, and strengthening structural resilience.",Not About Sufficiency
A consequential approach to life cycle sustainability assessment with an agent‐based model to determine the potential contribution of chemical recycling to UN Sustainable Development Goals,"Chemical recycling (CR) could support a circular approach for municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment. In promoting the recirculation of recyclable carbon‐containing waste as secondary feedstock for chemical production, it could contribute to resource conservation, emissions reduction, and supply security. To evaluate CR's contribution to the transition from a linear to a circular carbon economy—and correspondingly to the achievement of environmental, economic, and social sustainability as indicated in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN‐SDGs)—this study builds on extant literature of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) to investigate consequential environmental, economic, and social CR impacts. Specifically, an integrated approach whereby process‐based life cycle assessment, techno‐economic analysis, and social indicators are linked in the framework of an agent‐based model is developed to investigate sustainability consequences of CR via gasification of residual MSW in Germany. Results suggest that CR contributes to reducing climate change and to addressing terrestrial acidification and fossil resource scarcity. However, its deployment will be associated with significant system costs. Hence, to promote CR implementation, measures such as obliging direct waste incineration to trade CO2 certificates—provided that certificate prices increase sharply in the future—as well as implementing a recycling rate are found to be necessary to gap economic disadvantages. This study not only contributes to extending life cycle approaches for LCSA methodologically, it furthermore provides valuable insights into temporal and spatial interactions in waste management systems to inform science, industry, and politics about the sustainability impacts of CR on the achievement of the UN‐SDGs.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS SOLVING AS A FACTOR IN THE FORMATION OF A SUSTAINABLE AND BALANCED DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM,"Environmental problem-solving as a factor of sustainable and balanced development is an integral part of every country in the world, based on the interaction of man, nature, society, and the overcoming of crisis factors in an imbalanced world. That is why today it is necessary to move from the economics of aggressive expansion to the economics of sustainable development in order to promote the formation of a stable identity and social sustainability, which requires a fundamentally new development paradigm. The new paradigm of sustainable development as the main driver and megatrend of solving environmental problems includes climate change management and overcoming the destructive effects of climate change, natural resource management, the introduction of renewable energy sources, and environmental technologies that require a transition to a circular economy, which requires a new economic philosophy - overcoming the largescale destructive effects of the planet. The formation of a new paradigm is based on the idea that the country's future should be purposefully programmed as a balanced one. In order to achieve these objectives, a sustainable development paradigm should be formed which will lead to economic efficiency, inclusiveness, implementation of renewable energy sources, environmental protection, releasing the energy of entrepreneurship, innovation, and achieving sustainable and balanced development based on harmony, prosperity, risk reduction, well-being, and environmental safety.",Not About Sufficiency

Unveiling the complex web: exploring the international fossil fuel trade network and its impact on CO2 emissions and trade patterns,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to examine the structure of the international fossil fuel trade network (IFFTN) and assess its effects on CO2 emissions and global trade patterns. This research integrates complex network theory with econometric analysis to explore the dynamics of fossil fuel trade and its implications for environmental quality across various countries. Specifically, the study analyses the roles of different countries within this global network, examines the relationship between trade volumes and environmental impacts and evaluates how advancements in renewable energy generation could mitigate these effects. Through this comprehensive examination, the study seeks to provide an in-depth understanding of the trade-environment nexus.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses data on international fossil fuel trade from 2005 to 2020, which includes 74 countries categorized as high-income, low-income and Asian economies based on their roles in the global market. This research constructs the IFFTN, where countries are depicted as nodes and trade links as edges. The authors analyse network parameters, such as degree, density and clustering coefficient, along with trade metrics like strength and centrality. These parameters are integrated into a panel fixed effects model, with the robustness of the findings confirmed through dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) analysis.FindingsThe study finds that the dynamic fossil fuel trade network includes key players such as the USA, China, France, India, the Netherlands and South Korea. It demonstrates increased connectivity and dependence among these countries, directly correlating with higher CO2 emissions. However, this correlation is mitigated by the adoption of renewable energy, particularly in Asia and high-income countries. The impact on environmental quality is mediated through scale, technique and composition effects, suggesting significant environmental improvements through enhanced industry structure, technological progress and economies of scale.Research limitations/implicationsThis study recognizes several limitations. First, the categorization of countries into Asian economies, low-income and high-income groups may oversimplify the intricate effects of economic status on environmental impacts. Second, focusing primarily on per capita CO2 emissions may neglect other critical environmental indicators. Future research should consider examining regional variations and including a wider range of environmental metrics. This approach would offer a more detailed perspective on the nuanced interactions between economic development and environmental sustainability, enhancing the depth and applicability of the findings.Practical implicationsTo address the challenges of the IFFTN and CO2 emissions, several practical policy measures are recommended. Governments should enhance international cooperation by establishing global platforms for sharing best practices and initiating technology transfer agreements to accelerate the adoption of energy-efficient technologies. Additionally, a phased transition towards more sustainable energy sources is crucial, involving increased investment in the renewable energy sector alongside incentives for adopting green technologies. On the trade front, governments should modify trade partnerships to address congestion externalities, fostering a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly trade practices.Social implicationsThe social implications of the IFFTN are profound. As global reliance on fossil fuels continues, communities face heightened health risks due to increased pollution. Transitioning to renewable energy can alleviate these health concerns and the creation of green technologies, enhancing social well-being. Moreover, equitable access to energy-efficient solutions can reduce energy poverty, particularly in low-income countries, fostering greater societal resilience and inclusivity.Originality/valueThis study offers a pioneering examination of the trade-energy nexus across 74 countries, using complex network models to analyse diverse economic settings, particularly in Asian economies dominated by non-renewable energy. It identifies key market players and assesses their impact on dynamics such as congestion and market power. Additionally, the study explores the positive effects of renewable energy capacity on these relationships, highlighting its crucial role in driving sustainable energy transitions and enhancing the understanding of indirect trade-environment interactions.",Not About Sufficiency
"ECONOMIC GROWTH, ENVIRONMENT AND GREEN ECONOMY","Permanent efforts to maximize production, economic growth, have had a positive impact on population growth, raising the standard of living, and reducing poverty. In the global environment, maintaining a balance between economic development and the use of the world's resources is an important fact. Just as the gross domestic product and the income situation developed positively, the consumption of natural resources also grew over the years, which was reflected in the growth of the global material footprint, domestic material consumption and material footprint. In the paper, we will focus on investigating the relationship between economic growth, well-being and the material footprint. Based on data from the World Bank, since I960 the global GDP has increased from 10.94 billion dollars, to 87.95 billion dollars in 2022. Over the past nearly fifty years, the growth of world population and global GDP has necessitated an escalation in demand for natural resources. The use of natural resources in the form of material extraction has tripled since 1970, far beyond what industrial ecologists consider a sustainable limit. The concept of separating economic growth and resource use, or separating economic growth and environmental impacts, is gaining momentum globally. An essential prerequisite for maintaining sustainability is the efficient use of natural resources. This means supporting the efficient use of energy and resources, investing in renewable energy sources, supporting waste reduction and increasing recycling efforts, or encouraging technological innovation. The solution is sustainable production and consumption and the transition from a linear economy to a circular economy as much as possible.",Not About Sufficiency
Designing a circular carbon and plastics economy for a sustainable future,"The linear production and consumption of plastics today is unsustainable. It creates large amounts of unnecessary and mismanaged waste, pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, undermining global climate targets and the Sustainable Development Goals. This Perspective provides an integrated technological, economic and legal view on how to deliver a circular carbon and plastics economy that minimizes carbon dioxide emissions. Different pathways that maximize recirculation of carbon (dioxide) between plastics waste and feedstocks are outlined, including mechanical, chemical and biological recycling, and those involving the use of biomass and carbon dioxide. Four future scenarios are described, only one of which achieves sufficient greenhouse gas savings inline with global climate targets. Such a bold system change requires 50% reduction in future plastic demand, complete phase-out of fossil-derived plastics, 95% recycling rates of retrievable plastics and use of renewable energy. It is hard to overstate the challenge of achieving this goal. We therefore present a roadmap outlining the scale and timing of the economic and legal interventions that could possibly support this. Assessing the service lifespan and recoverability of plastic products, along with considerations of sufficiency and smart design, can moreover provide design principles to guide future manufacturing, use and disposal of plastics.",Not About Sufficiency
Suicide by poisoning in Switzerland,"During the course of the year 1971, 1030 cases of attempted suicide were reported to the Swiss Poison Information Center. In the same period the Swiss Federal Statistical Office recorded 266 deaths as a result of suicide by poisoning. In cases of attempted suicide the ratio of men to women was 0.4 to 1, whereas the ratio for cases of fatal suicide was 1.4 to 1. The majority of suicides were attempted by people between 20 and 40 yr of age, and most cases of serious poisoning also occurred in this age group. In cases resulting in death the distribution according to age for men showed 3 maxima, namely in the 20's, 40's and 60's. The majority of deaths involving women occurred between 40 and 50 yr of age. Drugs were by far the most frequently used agents for attempted suicides (89%), and much less often household products (4%) and pesticides (3.4%). The distribution was notably different in cases of fatal suicide: drugs (53.4%), carbon monoxide (34.6%), chemical raw materials (4.1%) and household products (4.5%). The actual motives for suicides could only be determined in cases of attempted suicide. The most usual reasons given were family problems, partner problems (boyfriend or girlfriend, matrimonial problems, pending separation or divorce, relationship between parents and children, authoritarian father), and less often problems at the place of work and school, or financial difficulties. Among the psychic and somatic disturbances most frequently encountered were endogenic and exogenic depression, schizophrenia, inferiority complexes through deformity or other physical disabilities, and alcoholism.",Not About Sufficiency

Control of the end-tidal P(CO2) in the hyperventilation syndrome: Effects of biofeedback and breathing instructions compared,"Twenty chronic hyperventilation syndrome patients were assigned to biofeedback training to raise end-tidal PCO2 level or received a breathing exercise schedule for home practice. Both methods offered equal opportunity for improving end-tidal PCO2 significantly. Alleviation of complaints, however, was only noticeable in the biofeedback group. This may be due to the fact that improvement in the severity of the hyperventilation syndrome was not only significantly related to increase in end-tidal PCO2 but also to initial end-tidal PCO2 level and state of the ventilatory controlling system. A follow-up evaluation three months after the end of the therapy programs showed an unchanged end-tidal PCO2 level in both groups as compared with post-treatment evaluation, but a significant relapse in complaints in the biofeedback group.

Social and Political Dimensions of Environmental Protection in Central America,"This study takes a critical look at mainstream efforts to protect and rehabilitate the environment in Central America. Despite some notable successes, many forest protection and tree planting schemes have not been effectively implemented and have even contributed to further environmental degradation, social inequality and impoverishment. It is argued that the trade‐off between environmental protection and human welfare which characterizes many schemes to protect forests and promote tree planting undermines not only local livelihoods but also the possibility of achieving basic environmental objectives, given the nature of local responses and their effects on project implementation. There is a need for a more integrative and socially‐aware approach to environmental planning which addresses two fundamental problems: the failure to locate environmental protection initiatives within a broader development framework and the failure to integrate concerns for environmental protection with the needs and rights of local people. Addressing these two problems of ‘macro‐’ and ‘micro‐coherency’ in environmental planning requires not only dealing with the many technical, administrative and financial constraints which typically characterize environmental programmes and projects, but also changes in the balance of social forces. © 1994 Institute of Social Studies",Not About Sufficiency
Utilization of ecosystem services in future vision decision-making for climate-resilient cities,"In the face of uncertain future climate change, city policy decision-makers must choose strategies that promote climate-resilient development. Nature-based solutions (NbSs) are considered important for solving urban problems, such as carbon neutrality, improving human well-being, and enhancing biodiversity. This study aimed to examine the possibility of using ecosystem services in decision-making for the future scenarios of the city, considering land use change and climate change in combination. Representative ecosystem services of eco-friendly urban paradigms were selected, and ecosystem services and synergies were analyzed when (1) only land use change was considered, and (2) climate change (RCP 8.5) and land use change were both considered. The selected ecosystem services were analyzed using statistical and model-based methods (InVest, MaxEnt) applied to each characteristic and collectible data. The results revealed that food (rice and fishery production) was affected by land use change, recreation and leisure was affected by external activities and climate change. Carbon uptake was affected by both climate change and land use change. Regarding synergy, the amount of carbon uptake decreased by - 1.60% in BAU (S1) and increased by 24.39% in Smart Shrinkage City (S3); however, regarding recreation, the differences depended on the scenarios, such as an increase in S1 by 5.26% and an increase in S3 by 0.99%.

US decarbonization impacts on air quality and environmental justice,"As policy organizations consider strategies to mitigate climate change, decarbonization initiatives can also reduce health-impacting air pollutants and may affect the associated racial disparities of adverse effects. With the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency CO-Benefits Risk Assessment Health Impacts Screening Tool (COBRA), we compare three decarbonization scenarios and their impacts at the regional and county scales. COBRA calculates changes in county-level ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and associated mortality impacts, for each decarbonization scenario. We compare these patterns with demographic data to evaluate the relative exposure reduction benefit across race and ethnicity. Carbon-free electricity would reduce national average ambient PM2.5 concentrations by 0.21 mu g m(-3), compared with a 0.19 mu g m(-3) reduction associated with carbon-free industrial activity, and a 0.08 mu g m(-3) reduction associated with carbon-free light duty vehicle (LDV) transportation. Decarbonization strategies also vary in terms of the racial groups most benefitting from each scenario, due to regional and urban/rural patterns in emission sources and population demographics. Black populations are the only group to experience relative exposure reduction benefits compared to the total population in every scenario, with industrial decarbonization yielding 23% greater reductions in ambient PM2.5 concentrations for Black populations than for the total U.S. population. The largest relative reduction in PM2.5 exposure was found for Asian populations in the carbon-free LDV transportation scenario (53%). The magnitudes of total air quality improvements by scenario vary across regions of the U.S., and generally do not align with the decarbonization policy that achieves the largest equity goal. Only the transportation decarbonization scenario meets the criteria of the Justice40 Initiative nationwide, fulfilling the 2021 commitment by U.S. President Biden that federal investments in clean energy are designed to allocate at least 40% of benefits to disadvantaged communities.",Not About Sufficiency

Unlocking the significant worldwide potential of better waste and resource management for climate mitigation: with particular focus on the Global South,"Numbers do matter; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s 2010 data that the waste sector is responsible for just 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has led to the misperception that solid waste management (SWM) has little to contribute to climate mitigation. Global efforts to control methane emissions and divert organic waste from landfills had already reduced direct emissions. But end-of-pipe SWM has also been evolving into more circular waste and resource management, with indirect GHG savings from the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) which IPCC accounts for elsewhere in the economy. The evidence compiled here on both direct emissions and indirect savings demonstrates with high confidence that better waste and resource management can make a significant contribution to climate mitigation, and must form a core part of every country's nationally determined contribution. Even the most advanced countries can still achieve much from the 3Rs. In the Global South, the challenge of extending waste collection to all and stopping open dumping and burning (sustainable development goal 11.6.1), essential to improve public health, can be turned into a huge opportunity. Moving early to divert waste from landfill by separation at source and collecting clean organic and dry recycling fractions, will mitigate global GHG emissions, slash ocean plastics and create decent livelihoods. But this can only happen with targeted climate, plastics and extended producer responsibility finance; and help to local communities to help themselves.",Not About Sufficiency
Unlocking Energy from Waste: A Comprehensive Analysis of Municipal Solid Waste Recovery Potential in Ghana,"Ghana is currently facing a waste crisis that presents considerable risks to its environment, economy, and public health. This investigation evaluates four prospective waste-to-energy options-namely, incineration, anaerobic digestion, gasification, and landfill gas-with the objective of mapping out a sustainable strategy for efficient waste management. Among these solutions, anaerobic digestion stands out as a superior option, offering renewable energy production, valuable bio-product creation, and a comparatively lower greenhouse gas emission effect. A cost analysis further reveals that utilizing biogas from anaerobic digestion is not only environmentally friendly but also economically more viable than relying on light crude oil. Producing 200 MW of energy using biogas costs 36% less, potentially resulting in monthly savings of USD 5.46 million for Ghana. However, several obstacles impede the development of WtE. Inaccurate waste data and a lack of clear policies on waste-to-energy hinder the harnessing of Ghana's WtE potential. To address this, the study recommends (1) implementing a well-defined national strategy complete with regulations and incentives to attract investments and (2) conducting specialized research to optimize WtE technologies for Ghana's unique waste composition and context. By surmounting these challenges, Ghana stands poised to secure a sustainable future, simultaneously meeting the targets of Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 11. This entails ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all (SDG 7) and fostering inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements (SDG 11).",Not About Sufficiency
"Understanding stakeholder perceptions of environmental justice: a study of tourism in the Erhai Lake basin, Yunnan province, China","Environmental justice is an important component of sustainable tourism, but stakeholder perspectives related to environmental justice may vary. Using Q-methodology, we investigated different stakeholder perceptions related to environmental justice within the context of tourism and ecological restoration. Specifically, in the Erhai Lake basin, China, we explore perspectives around an ecological restoration effort that included the government mandated closure of 1900 establishments (inns and restaurants) in response to environmental degradation. We identify and explore four environmental justice perspectives: the togetherness, protection, operator loss, and local loss perspectives. These four perspectives are contextualized within three dimensions of environmental justice (i.e., distribution, recognition, and participation). Our findings highlight differing views related to who is affected most by the inn closures (e.g., future generations, local residents, inn owners), and general consensus related to the outcomes of the process being more important than the process itself. Finally, we discuss potential reasons for these differing perspectives and recommend ways to improve environmental justice among different stakeholders. This research can facilitate sustainable development of tourism by highlighting the facets of ecological restoration policy implementation most important to stakeholders, including recognition of diverse stakeholder concerns and identities, clear and well supported rationale for policy design, and increased equity in the distribution of costs and benefits of policies.",Not About Sufficiency

This study is one of the few that empirically explores how various explanatory variables affect CO2 and ecological footprint. The study employed the pool mean group autoregressive distributive lag (PMG-ARDL), fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) techniques for the analysis. In the long-run, non-renewable energy and economic growth have a positive impact, whereas renewable energy and remittances have a negative impact on CO2 and ecological footprint. The impact of non-renewable energy on CO2 and ecological footprint is more significant than renewable energy in both the short- and long-run. Most of the variables have a bidirectional causality among each other.

Treaty Preambles and The Environmental Justice Gap,"Global environmental architectures have the potential to reduce inequalities, however, legal, and political procedures and structures may also increase injustices and disempowerment. Multilateral environmental agreements create large regimes over some of the most expansive planetary systems. Contracting states list the purposes, motivations and considerations that led them to conclude legally binding agreements in treaty preambles that are an interpretive tool, a declaration of context, motivation, and intent of the contracting states or parties. This study produces an environmental justice conceptual framework that references the scholarship on environmental justice and environmental governance, outlines the elements required to introduce environmental justice debates into treaty preambles, and gives an example of its application to determine whether the preambles include justice concepts. The preambles selected are from treaties with broad geographic and subject matter scope: they regulate oceans, climate, and biodiversity, the transport of waste, mercury pollution, migratory and endangered species, and wetlands. Using the environmental justice conceptual framework, the study found a justice gap between how justice is addressed in justice debates and literatures and the stated intent of the contracting parties in the preambles. The conclusions support the literature that argues that multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) are ahistorical as regards the moral responsibility that lies at the heart of the definitions of justice.",Not About Sufficiency
Transmigrants Experiences of Recognitional (in)Justice in Indonesia's Environmental Impact Assessment,"This paper unpacks the environmental justice concerns of rural migrants in relation to land tenure and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes. We explore the ""geography of recognition"", whereby sense of community, identity and place interact to produce unequal experiences of recognitional justice in relation to the EIA process. We develop our argument by using qualitative research and a village case study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, involving transmigrant communities and indigenous Kutai people. This study highlights how a failure to recognize transmigrants' identity creates barriers to their meaningful participation in the EIA. Structural flaws in the decentralized land-use system mean a failure to address the contested claims for recognition and land rights between transmigrant and indigenous communities, which in turn fuels social and environmental conflict. Resolving land tenure conflicts requires the empowerment of socially marginalized groups in the decision-making over land-use projects affecting them.",Not About Sufficiency
Transitioning to a low carbon society through energy communities: Lessons learned from Brazil and Italy,"New legal arrangements for the aggregation of distributed generation and demand are required for the future electricity grid so as to increase flexibility, resilience, citizens? participation and also alleviate energy poverty. To promote the transitioning to a low carbon society, countries are reforming their legal framework to enable broad civic engagement in the energy markets. This work analyses the process of reform of the legal framework of the electric sector with focus on energy communities, using two study cases, one in Brazil and another in Italy. The research performed is applied, qualitative, descriptive and exploratory. The work uses multiple research methods, blending case studies, semi-structured interviews and a systematic literature review for data collection and the functional method of comparative law, discourse analysis and triangulation for data analysis. The findings suggest greater consideration of the energy poverty nexus in the policy design of the electricity sector and they also reveal the important role of specialized technical bodies and governmental institutions for the takeoff and success of an energy community endeavour, highlighting crucial aspects for an energy transition aligned with the Paris Agreement and the goals of Agenda 2030.",Not About Sufficiency
Transformative disruptiveness or transition? Revealing digitalization and deep decarbonization pathways in the Italian smart electricity meter roll-out,"Energy infrastructure digitalization is proposed as key for a just deep decarbonization. However, an integrative literature review reveals the lack of a more profound exploration on normative considerations tied to world perspectives and values, as levers of a lasting transformation in the context of socio-technical transitions. Thus, the paper employs qualitative research methods to investigate how energy infrastructure digitalization contributes to transformative disruption, along which deliberated deep decarbonization pathways, using Italy's smart electricity meter roll-out as a case study. While the roll-out represents a substantial effort in introducing digital devices into the residential sector, concerns persist about its effectiveness, also due to potential societal disruptions. Through in-depth interviews with experts (N = 17) and citizens (N = 23) and content-oriented analysis, the research unveils evolving pathways between ever more disengaged two grand narratives and value systems: energy as a commodity and energy as a common good. The first opts for technological progress, changing consumer behavior, to address energy poverty and social justice, building on market-based instruments and new business models. Conversely, the second harbors skepticism towards technological fixes, emphasizes energy sufficiency and questions energy opulence, linked to environmental justice considerations, and calling for corrective principles by regulatory means. Finally, the paper presents a conceptual framework to re-shape deep deliberative transformation, highlighting the importance of re-connecting to defined values, re-generating actionable knowledge, restructuring institutions in societal experimentation, and recognizing underlying processes such as justice claims. It argues for further research into discourse coalitions capitalizing on defined narratives, to better understand their impact on policy-making processes.",Not About Sufficiency
Transactional colonialism in wind energy investments: Energy injustices against vulnerable people in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,"Energy production is a source of disputes across the world. Governments and firms argue that investing in wind energy contributes to the sustainable development of energy systems. However, wind farms perpetuate ongoing injustices and instigate new injustices. Vulnerable groups such as excluded and marginalised indigenous people can trace the injustices in low-carbon investments to a historical continuity of oppression and repression by internal and external elite groups. Based on a qualitative longitudinal study in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, we expand our understanding of the energy justice framework in two ways. First, we show that cognitive justice is a vital dimension for understanding different ways of life, traditions and customs. Second, we propose the new concept of 'transactional colonialism', which emphasises the role of economic transactions between firms and economically motivated members of indigenous communities with the support of elite actors. This article provides new insights into the conflicting dynamics of wind energy investments in the Global South.",Not About Sufficiency
Tracing the development of Anti-Fossil Fuel Norms: insights from the Republic of Ireland,"Recent scholarly work on sustainability transitions has highlighted the importance of the development of norms against fossil fuels, or Anti-Fossil Fuel Norms (AFFNs), for climate mitigation. However, further research is needed to understand the mechanisms and conditions by which such norms are developed and secured for successful sustainability transitions. This paper contributes to addressing this, through analysing the case of the Republic of Ireland, probing the emergence of norms against fossil fuels and notably against natural gas (also referred to here as 'fossil gas'). Whilst Ireland is considered an overall laggard on climate action, in recent years the country has witnessed several ground-breaking supply-side moves against fossil fuels. Drawing on in-depth original research interviews and analysis of key political sources, including parliamentary debates and policy documents, the paper finds evidence of norms against fossil gas emerging in the Irish case. The analysis contributes insights into the iterative development of AFFNs at the domestic level, the role of environmental movements, and broader lessons for the development of a just transition away from fossil gas.Key policy insightsInitial moves against fossil fuels, even if not successful, can unleash political feedback effects which open space for more stringent policy development over timeDelayed action on sustainability leads to more complex transition challenges, with implications for ensuring justice within transition processesGrassroots environmental movements are important 'norm entrepreneurs', providing important sources of expertise, effective communication for policy and the public on the impacts of fossil fuels and mobilisation of wider citizen support for climate policyAFFN discursive framings can help to build alliances, advance climate justice, and support the development of environmentally and socially just transitions.",Not About Sufficiency
"Toxicants, entanglement, and mitigation in New England's emerging circular economy for food waste","Drawing on research with food waste recycling facilities in New England, this paper explores a fundamental tension between the eco-modernist logics of the circular economy and the reality of contemporary waste streams. Composting and digestion are promoted as key solutions to food waste, due to their ability to return nutrients to agricultural soils. However, our work suggests that food waste processors increasingly find themselves responsible for policing boundaries between distinct ""material"" and ""biological"" systems as imagined by the architects of the circular economy-boundaries penetrable by toxicants. This responsibility creates significant problems for processors due to the regulatory, educational, and structural barriers documented in this research. This paper contributes to scholarship which suggests the need to rethink the modernist logics of the circular economy and to recognize the realities of entangled material and biological systems. More specifically, we argue that if circularity is the goal, policy needs to recognize the barriers food waste processors face and concentrate circularity efforts further upstream to ensure fair, just, and safe circular food systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards Decarbonization: Sustainable Incentives in a Price-Competitive Maritime Supply Chain with Environmentally Conscious Shippers,"Transitioning carriers to low-emission technologies requires huge investment, and subsidies have proven to be efficient tools in overcoming cost barriers. In this study, game-theoretic models were formulated to study the impact of subsidies on carbon emissions reduction with green shippers in a price-competitive environment. Equilibrium solutions for three scenarios were derived through model analysis, followed by numerical analyses. The results indicate the following: (1) Government subsidies are effective and advantageous for decarbonization with carrier competition but will lower service prices, profits, and social welfare. (2) Intensified price competition leads to increases in carbon emissions, service prices, and social welfare while decreasing demands and profits in some scenarios. (3) Shippers' green preferences have a positive effect on carbon emission reduction, profits, and social welfare. These findings provide valuable managerial insights for both the government and shipping companies in promoting a more sustainable environment.",Not About Sufficiency
"Towards a Just Energy Transition, Barriers and Opportunities for Positive Energy District Creation in Spain","To mitigate the effects of climate change, the European Commission created a Strategic Energy Technology Plan committing to forming 100 Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) by 2025. These are considered to potentially be major instruments for decarbonization in a just transition. This plan has led to some districts being defined as PEDs, although none have fully met the criteria to be a PED yet. Research shows that new forms of energy ownership and production, as could potentially be found in PEDs, could help reduce energy poverty, which affects a significant segment of the population, as households can reduce their energy expenditure as well as improve their energy behavior. This paper set out to shed light on the PED landscape, investigating the barriers and opportunities to PED creation in Spain and its potential to mitigate energy poverty. We conducted a literature review on community-owned energy in Spain, followed with expert interviews (energy researchers, stakeholders, and NGOs) who focus on sustainability issues in Spain. Results show a number of barriers (lack of knowledge and awareness, and lack of trust from consumers) and opportunities connected with the creation of PEDs. In conclusion, policymaker engagement and support play a key role in successfully implementing PEDs.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards a just circular transition: Fostering principles and stakeholder roles in sustainable partnerships,"Developing sustainable partnerships is deemed crucial and timely for advancing circular economy transition efforts. Yet, academic literature signals a need for additional insights into stakeholder roles and their impact on social and environmental justice. The Quintuple Helix Model offers a framework to analyze how stakeholders from the five 'helices' can collaborate to overcome sustainability difficulties. Using an embedded multiple case study design, this exploratory paper proposes a set of 10 principles and 11 stakeholder roles for fostering a just circular economy transition, whilst recognizing the complexity of real-world sustainable partnerships. This paper further discusses challenges that may endanger the maintenance of sustainable partnerships such as conflicting or misaligned stakeholder interests, power imbalances, competition, lack of trust, conflict, or resource constraints. The paper extends the Quintuple Helix Model's applicability toward circular transitions, by introducing fostering principles and stakeholder roles that facilitate a just circular transition.

"Towards a Comprehensive Framework of the Relationships between Resource Footprints, Quality of Life, and Economic Development","The relationship between economic affluence, quality of life, and environmental implications of production and consumption activities is a recurring issue in sustainability discussions. A number of studies examined selected relationships, but the general implications for future development options to achieve environmentally and socially sustainable development of countries at different levels of per capita resource footprints, quality of life, and income have not yet been investigated in detail. In this study, we use a global dataset with 173 countries to assess the overall relationship between resource footprints, quality of life, and economic development over the period of 1990-2015. We select the material footprint and carbon footprint and contrast them with the Human Development Index, the Happiness Index, and GDP per capita. Regression analyses show that the relationship between various resource footprints and quality of life generally follows a logarithmic path of development, while resource footprints and GDP per capita are linearly connected. From the empirical results, we derive a generalized path of development and cluster countries along this path. Within this comprehensive framework, we discuss options to change the path to respect planetary and social boundaries through a combination of resource efficiency increases, substitution of industries and sufficiency of consumption. We conclude that decoupling and green growth will not realize sustainable development if planetary boundaries have already been transgressed.",Not About Sufficiency
"Towards a CO2-neutral steel industry: Justice aspects of CO2 capture and storage, biomass- and green hydrogen-based emission reductions","A rapid transition towards a CO2-neutral steel industry is required to limit climate change. Such a transition raises questions of justice, as it entails positive and negative impacts unevenly distributed across societal stakeholders. To enable stakeholders to address such concerns, this paper assesses the justice implications of three options that reduce emissions: CO2 capture and storage (CCS) on steel (up to 70%), bio-based steelmaking (up to 50%), and green hydrogen-based steel production (up to 100%). We select justice indicators from the energy, climate, labour and environmental justice literature and assess these indicators qualitatively for each of the technological routes based on literature and desk research. We find context-dependent differences in justness between the different technological routes. The impact on stakeholders varies across regions. There are justice concerns for local communities because of economic dependence on, and environmental impact of the industry. Communities elsewhere are impacted through the siting of infrastructure and feedstock production. CCS and biobased steelmaking routes can help retain industry and associated economic benefits on location, while hydrogen based steelmaking may deal better with environmental concerns. We conclude that, besides techno-economic and environmental information, transparency on sector-specific justice implications of transforming steel industries is essential for decision-making on technological routes.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards a circular economy and just transition to net-zero in rural Scotland: Resident perspectives on policy and practice,"The circular economy and just transition are key dimensions of the sustainability challenges of the 21st century. These concepts are ambiguous and meanings differ among actors, sectors and contexts. This paper examines the circular economy and a just transition to net-zero in the Scottish context, where both are prominent in national policy discourses and central to the work of Zero Waste Scotland. It is based on qualitative research, co-designed with Zero Waste Scotland, to explore how rural residents in Scotland understand the circular economy and just transition, in their everyday lives and communities. This is an under-researched area and our findings add new knowledge useful for implementing sustainability policies in a rural context. Focus groups were carried out in three rural areas, engaging with a range of residents in a deliberative setting. The findings support the need for a more collaborative, whole systems approach that moves beyond siloed thinking and which focuses on local capacity and knowledge building for transitions to more sustainable rural communities.",Not About Sufficiency
TOWARD A SOCIALLY JUST TRANSITION TO LOW CARBON DEVELOPMENT: THE CASE OF INDONESIA,"In 2019, the Indonesian government released its post-Paris Agreement report Low Carbon Development: a paradigm shift towards a green economy in Indonesia, in which it set out an economic rationale for a move to low carbon growth. The core of the paradigm shift referenced in the report's title was that growth not only had to be decoupled from high carbon inputs but that in both practice and outcomes it had to be sustainable and inclusive. Yet the report does little to define social justice, equity practices, or inclusive outcomes in a green economy context. In this article, we foreground distributive, procedural and recognition aspects of social justice that are central to Indonesia's climate mitigation efforts and transition to a green, low carbon economy. We focus on two sectors that are key to this transition - forest and land-use, and energy. Our analysis shows that existing forms of injustice can exacerbate challenges for decarbonisation action and that low carbon transitions initiatives have been unable to overcome various forms of injustice and have, in some cases, created new injustices.",Not About Sufficiency
Toward a just circular economy: conceptualizing environmental labor and gender justice in circularity studies,"Over the past decade, the concept of circular economy (CE) has gained political traction as a potential solution to economy-environment tradeoffs. However, critical social scientists have raised concerns that CE may not address the root causes or consequences of environmental degradation, thus remaining ineffective. Concurring with this critique, this article highlights three constituent elements of the linear economy that remain unaddressed in CE frameworks: environmental, labor, and gender inequalities. Building upon scholarship from environmental justice, environmental labor studies, and feminist ecological economics, we elaborate a conceptual framework to interrogate the existing literature. Our analysis shows that current CE models 1) are mainly concerned with return on capital investment and sustained growth of gross domestic product (GDP) rather than with redressing the North/South inequalities embedded in the linear economy model; 2) present a limited perspective on labor, with a primary focus on the number of jobs to be created, rather than their quality, or workers' leadership; and 3) overlook gender inequalities and the sexual division of labor, thus reproducing the devaluation of care that lays at the roots of socioecological crises. We conclude by suggesting avenues for elaborating a ""just circular economy"" framework.",Not About Sufficiency
Imperata economics and policy,"Should policymakers - or anyone else - care about millions of ha of Imperata grasslands? The answer depends on the balance between costs of conversion to other uses and the net benefits produced in economic growth, poverty alleviation, and protection of the environment. The first section on Imperata economics sets up the analytical framework to address this question and draws on the wider development economics literature to consider whether growth and poverty alleviation are conflicting or complementary objectives. Although evidence is limited, it suggests smallholder-based agroforestry could provide the same economic growth with greater poverty alleviation than large-scale forestry estates. There is, however, no substitute for project appraisal for specific settings. The second section on Imperata policy reviews whether policy distortions and market failures provide a sufficient rationale for direct policy intervention to promote tree planting on Imperata grasslands. Estimates of imputed values of carbon sequestration to alleviate global warming are presented for Acacia mangium and rubber agroforestry. The conclusion summarizes the policy research agenda and examines the desirability and feasibility of policy intervention to promote carbon sequestration through Imperata grassland conversion to tree-based systems.",Not About Sufficiency
The marginal costs of greenhouse gas emissions,"Estimates of the marginal costs of greenhouse gas emissions are an important input to the decision how much society would want to spend on greenhouse gas emission reduction. Marginal cost estimates in the literature range between $5 and $25 per tonne of carbon. Using similar assumptions, the FUND model finds marginal costs of $9-23/tC, depending on the discount rate. If the aggregation of impacts over countries accounts for inequalities in income distribution or for risk aversion, marginal costs would rise by about a factor of 3. Marginal costs per region are an order of magnitude smaller than global marginal costs. The ratios between the marginal costs of CO2 and those of CH4 and N2O are roughly equal to the global warming potentials of these gases. The uncertainty about the marginal costs is large and right-skewed. Tlte expected value of the marginal costs lies about 35% above the best guess, the 95-percentile about 250%.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SUSTAINABILITY DIMENSIONS IN GREECE,"Sustainability, or sustainable development has three aspects: economic, social and environmental. The level of economic development is shown by a nation's standard of living or purchasing power and is measured by the real per capita output. Social resilience is indicated by income inequality and quantified by the Gini coefficient. Environmental sustainability isapproximated by the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per capita. The objective of this research is to empirically study the relationships between the degree of economic development, socialresilience and environmental quality in Greece.This objective has been accomplished by deriving the original and the environmental Kuznets curves for Greece. The original Kuznets curve displays the connection between the level of economic development (real GDP per capita) and social stability (the Gini coefficient), whereas the environmental Kuznets curve illustrates the link between the degree of economic development and the level of environmental degradation.The relationships between the standard of living and income inequality,on the one hand, and the standard of living and environmental degradation, on the other hand, have been both investigated by an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The empirical results from the research show that in Greece the rise in social resilience and environmental quality is accompanied by a fall in the living standard (the purchasing power per capita).It is advisable that Greek policymakers shift the Kuznets curves to the right in order to achieve a better trade-off between the living standard, on the one hand, and income inequality and the quality of environment, on the other hand.The original Kuznets curve may be shifted to the right by changing the type Green tax system from consumption-based to hybrid.The environmental Kuznets curve can be moved to the right by investments in low-carbon economy, which contribute to ""green"" economic growth.",Not About Sufficiency
Conservation agrivoltaics for sustainable food-energy production,"Transformative strategies in agriculture are needed to address urgent global challenges related to energy and food production while reinforcing natural resources and the environment. Agrivoltaics (AV) has emerged in the past decade as one solution to this fundamental challenge of improving energy and food security. AV is defined as the co-location of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and crops on the same land to optimize food and energy production simultaneously and sustainably. Here, we propose that AV, together with conservation agriculture management practices (CAMP) strategies can help to intensify food security and energy production while reinforcing natural resources and the environment. Our main assertions in this opinion article are that: (1) AV systems need to overcome several agronomical, environmental, and ecological challenges to intensify food and energy production sustainably; (2) CAMP applied to AV systems can preserve the environment and ensure climate-resilient food production; (3) implementation of CAMP in AV can lead to long-term carbon sequestration, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and maintain or increase crop yields while preserving soil health and biodiversity; and (4) adoption of CAMP in AV can bring economic benefits, although challenges need to be overcome.

Effects of response requirement and the availability of an alternative reinforcer on cigarette smoking by schizophrenics,"Cigarette smoking and other forms of drug abuse are more prevalent among schizophrenics than the general population. Despite the clinical importance of this problem, there has been relatively little experimental study of schizophrenic drug use. We examined under controlled laboratory conditions the effects of response requirement and the availability of an alternative (monetary) reinforcer on cigarette smoking by schizophrenics. Subjects were six heavy smokers with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Before each session, subjects provided carbon monoxide samples indicating recent smoking abstinence. During 3-h sessions, subjects obtained opportunities to smoke (2 puffs/opportunity) under a fixed ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement, which varied across sessions from FR50 to FR6400. In half of the sessions, subjects also were able to earn a small amount of money ($0.25/ratio completed) under an FR400 schedule. Increasing the response requirement for smoking decreased smoking and increased smoking- maintained responding. The availability of the monetary reinforcer decreased smoking and smoking-maintained responding by approximately half. These results are consistent with those seen previously in community volunteers without major mental illness studied under the same experimental conditions, suggesting that smoking by these two populations is controlled, at least in part, by a common set of determinants.",Not About Sufficiency

"Three Sides of the Same Coin? A Bayesian Analysis of Strategic Management, Comprehensive Planning, and Inclusionary Values in Land Use","Local government managers face fundamental, value conflicts when they engage urban land use issues. Despite the planet's ongoing urbanization, managerial influence on land use policy remains an under-examined arena. Local governments are routinely asked to balance economic, ecological, and social equity concerns when making choices between alternative land use policy tools. Are local government sustainable development efforts more strategic, comprehensive, and inclusive than when led by professional public managers rather than elected mayors? How do the institutional forms of government inhibit or enhance the ability of specific policy demanders to influence the use of these tools under varying economic conditions? We answer these questions by examining the relationship between local government structure and land use policy utilization in different economic environments with a Bayesian analysis of surveys of Florida cities at three time periods. Differences between manager and mayoral executive leadership shape public management strategies, comprehensiveness, and inclusionary motives linked to land use policy tool utilization before and after the housing boom of the mid-2000s. However, management turnover mitigates this effect. Moreover, managerial influence is not evident at the housing bubble's peak, which we argue is an important caveat to the empirical evidence on form of government.",Not About Sufficiency

The Upcycling and Reappropriation - On Art-Specific Circular Economy in the Age of Climate Change,"Whereas mainstream theories of environmental art and sustainable development consider art as a domain suitable for the application of environmentally friendly procedures, such as the circular economy, trash management and digitization, this research article focuses on the internal development of the autopoetic and self -referential art machine, which generates an art-specific sustainability. The circular environmental economy coexists with the circular art economy, which implies changes in the aesthetics and poetics of the artwork; it deploys upcycling to use art trash in creating a new, higher value object. Art-specific sustainability contributes to the power and complexity of the art machine with new conceptual interventions and devices. These devices allow art to resist threats from other fields and to redefine itself. As sustainable development agendas of international organizations take into account the social, political, and economic initiatives that promote ethics, inclusion, and tolerance, this article discusses the contributions of contemporary environmental art to expanded concepts of the political and science.

However, research shows that the relationship among human well-being, resource use, and the associated emissions is complex and context specific. To better understand if natural resource use plays a historic role in generating human well-being in the United States, the authors conduct a time-series analysis of greenhouse gas emissions and average life expectancy from 1913 to 2017. The results show that increases in greenhouse gas emissions per capita have an instantaneous, negative effect on life expectancy. The authors also find evidence that income inequality has a long-run negative effect on life expectancy. Additional analyses provide mixed results regarding whether and how the effects of emissions on life expectancy are conditional on income inequality.

The Sufficiency-Based Circular Economy-An Analysis of 150 Companies,"The circular economy has become a popular paradigm in the business and policy spheres. It can support sustainable development by aiming to safeguard the resources to mitigate negative impacts on the climate and the environment and to sustain our current and future generations. Yet, despite progress with circular economy initiatives, there is a risk of focusing on incremental innovations with little real impact, and possibly even creating serious negative rebound effects. This study suggests that the concept of ""sufficiency"" is inadequately represented in the current circular economy discourse and innovations, and this may be undermining real progress. In this paper, the Sufficiency-based Circular Economy paradigm is introduced. We investigate the following questions: What is the role of business in the sufficiency-based circular economy? What are the institutional limitations to the role of business as a driver for the transition and how might these be overcome? We conduct a ""practice research"" by analyzing company cases of sufficiency practices in a business context. We analyse 150 business cases to identify how their organizational strategies support sufficiency and what type of innovations they exemplify within this transition.

The role of informal green spaces in reducing inequalities in urban green space availability to children and seniors,"Urban green spaces (UGS) offer a wide range of ecosystem services to city dwellers, contributing to their health and well-being. The resources of formally designated UGS, such as parks and forests, are frequently under-provided, however. This results in unequal access to UGS, which has become an environmental justice issue. We investigated the potential of informal green spaces (IGS) to complement existing formal UGS to reduce distributional inequity in UGS availability. We focused on the most vulnerable groups of citizens, children and elderly residents, for whom the availability of UGS plays a particularly important role. The study was performed in two Eastern-European cities, Warsaw and Lodi, both characterised by a well-developed system of UGS but of different spatial composition and UGS configuration. We focus on unmanaged areas within IGS and link them to the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services, such as enabling direct contact with nature. We identified different categories of formal and informal UGS based on publicly available data, supported by NDVI values, followed by UGS availability analysis of formal and informal UGS in the service area of 300 m for each residential building. We found that informal UGS are equally important as formal ones, and they may contribute to better access to selected urban ecosystem services. Both cities are characterised by unequal distribution of formal UGS. In Lodi, children are least favoured in terms of UGS availability, while in Warsaw, elderly citizens are most excluded. In both cities, it is the green areas associated with transportation routes communication routes, multifamily housing and agricultural lands along with grasslands that have the greatest potential to improve the equal availability of UGS to residents. We propose maintaining various types of unmanaged green areas in cities to help limit disparities to UGS access, and it would also increase their importance in the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of electricity market design for energy storage in cost-efficient decarbonization,"Energy storage is widely recognized by power system utilities and regulators as a crucial resource for achieving energy decarbonization. However, in deregulated power systems, investor-owned storage participates in electricity markets with a profit-driven motive. The alignment of such profit-driven operations with social welfare critically depends on market design and storage's participation choices. This study employs an agent-based approach and investigates the impact of different market participation options on storage's contribution to reducing electricity costs and carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the existing electricity pool market design in North America may encourage early-stage storage adoptions but hinder progress toward deep decarbonization. We found that day-ahead markets are more effective in utilizing storage to reduce carbon emissions, while real-time markets are more effective in reducing costs.

However, the application of ecosystem services in the RSJOS framework still constitutes a knowledge gap in the realm of landscape sustainability science.ObjectivesOur objective was to discuss the role of ecosystem services within the Safe and Just Operating Space (SJOS) framework to promote regional sustainability.MethodsWe analyzed the relationship between ecosystem services and the SJOS framework, including their similarities in core concepts and research objectives, as well as how ecosystem services relate to environmental ceilings and social foundations. Based on these analyses, we discussed the potential and challenges of bridging safe space and just space using an ecosystem services approach.ResultsWe found that ecosystem services have the potential to help understand the interaction between ecological ceilings and social foundations when assessing RSJOS, using ecosystem service flows to link ""safe"" and ""just"" boundaries. However, challenges in applying ecosystem services to assess RSJOS can limit the benefits of this framework.ConclusionsThe examination of RSJOS should extend beyond snapshots of the current regional state and encompass their inherent interconnections and impact mechanisms. This broader perspective can subsequently inform policy decisions. Ecosystem services play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges within the RSJOS framework.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of economic policy uncertainty and social welfare in the view of ecological footprint: evidence from the traditional and novel platform in panel ARDL approaches,"In the contemporary world, environmental degradation has become a concern for human beings. Accordingly, the impact of social welfare, economic policy uncertainty, natural resource rents, life expectancy, and trade openness are examined on ecological footprint (the most comprehensive proxy of environmental degradation) in 19 energy- intensive countries from 1997 to 2018. With this in mind, this study used the traditional panel ARDL and CS-ARDL approaches to evaluate how the study's variables influence ecological footprint. Notably, the results of the CS-ARDL approach are more robust due to cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity problems. The outcomes revealed that economic policy uncertainty and trade openness affect the ecological footprint negatively in the short run and positively in the long run. Moreover, social welfare degrades the environment in the long run, and natural resource rents improve environmental quality by mitigating the ecological footprint in the short run and harming the environment in the long run. Besides, life expectancy does not significantly affect ecological footprint in the long or short run. Meanwhile, the results confirmed the bi-directional causal relationship between the study's variable and ecological footprint. Based on the outcomes, the way to adopt effective policies to improve the quality of the environment has been paved. Furthermore, a comprehensive policy framework for stricter environmental regulation is expected to be developed using the outcomes derived from this study.",Not About Sufficiency
The risk-based environmental footprints and sustainability deficits of nations,"The implementation of environmental sustainability accounting has attracted academic attention; however, methods to accommodate local biophysical limitations remain underexplored. We developed a novel risk-footprint environmental sustainability assessment (Risk-Footprint ESA) framework to measure a country's environmental sustainability with respect to local biophysical capacity to help nations take collective action to stay within a safe operating space. Our findings indicated that the global environmental footprints of water, land, energy, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus witnessed variable increases of 325 %, 39 %, 36 %, 95 %, 6 %, and 3 % respectively, between 1990 and 2015. China, India, and the United States exhibited the largest footprints across these categories. Excluding water and land use, it appears that the global population is not maintaining lifestyles within the limits of the planet. Furthermore, the most effectively managed resource was land, with nearly 95 % of the countries maintaining sustainable reserves from 1990 to 2015. Conversely, nitrogen presents the greatest challenge in achieving sustainability, with only 25 % of the countries managing a reserve for this indicator. Additionally, there was a correlation between rising affluence and exceeding sustainability limits, suggesting that low income reduces the chances of eradicating poverty and diminishes the ability to maintain environmental sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
The politics of negative emissions technologies and decarbonization in rural communities,"Non-technical summary Technologies and practices to remove carbon from the atmosphere ('negative emissions technologies') will be challenging to scale-up. Efforts to incentivize or govern their scale-up globally risk failing if they miss the social challenges. This paper analyzes prospective challenges for negative emissions through examining how decarbonization practices are evolving in one particular landscape: the Imperial Valley in southeast California, a desert landscape engineered for industrial agriculture. Based on semi-structured interviews and site visits, this paper examines how community actors have received, participated in, imagined or contested new energy technologies and climate practices, and draws out takeaways for negative emissions policy. Technical summary This article examines prospective challenges and opportunities for scaling up negative emissions technologies (NETs) through examining how decarbonization practices are evolving in one particular landscape: the Imperial Valley in southeast California, a desert landscape engineered for industrial agriculture. Local officials, community activists and business ventures are re-imagining the valley as a renewable energy landscape, some with interest in carbon-negative technologies. At the same time, aspects of this strategy for economic development via green energy are often contested. Based on semi-structured interviews and site visits, this paper examines how landscape-level actors have received, participated in, imagined or contested new energy technologies and climate practices. Through analyzing local perspectives on climate change and emerging energy technologies, the paper draws out three takeaways for the governance of NETs: (1) entrenched interests can play a role in shaping how particular NETs compete; (2) environmental justice concerns around NETs should be viewed as more than not-in-my-backyard-ism; and (3) incentives for NETs must be tailored to local contexts. The conclusion discusses two crosscutting challenges: the lack of institutions to build out new infrastructure and the challenge of generating narratives around invisible 'negative' emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
"The political economy of net-zero transitions: Policy drivers, barriers, and justice benefits to decarbonization in eight carbon-neutral countries","This study examines the political economy of decarbonization in eight countries over the period 2000 to 2021/ 2022 that have already achieved a national net-zero transition. These countries are Bhutan, Suriname, Panama, Guyana, Comoros, Gabon, Madagascar, and Niue. It utilizes an analytical method of a rich, interdisciplinary and systematized literature review integrated with thematic analysis. For each of these countries, the study examines the drivers and political motivation behind net-zero progress, including the timeline of events; the barriers and challenges that had to be overcome; and the benefits of decarbonization and its impacts on equity and justice. The main objectives of the study are to broaden the evidence base on low-carbon transitions beyond often and even overstudied countries that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democracies, or WEIRD countries, and to offer new empirical data on the strategy of energy policies in the real world, examining the first eight countries to achieve net-zero success in the modern era. It finds that all eight countries used a similar mix of nine policy interventions involving land use, renewable energy, and waste management. Common barriers included vulnerability to the effects of extreme climate events either in the form of natural disasters (i.e. landslides and floodings) or ecosystems degradation (i.e. ocean acidification, coastal erosion and forests loss). Despite these barriers, achieving net-zero emissions positively impacted marginalized communities by providing a more equitable distribution of climate benefits, mitigating adverse health effects and reducing social inequalities, particularly in low-income areas.",Not About Sufficiency
The Myanmar borderlands as a green energy transition 'sacrifice zone': A case study of rare earth mining in Kachin state,"This article examines the challenges of achieving a 'just transition' to a sustainable and low-carbon economy and the spatially uneven distribution of costs that such a transition entails. It does so from the vantage point of Myanmar's war-torn borderlands with China, which have emerged as a major source of heavy rare earth elements, crucial to technologies including electric vehicles and wind turbines. Through a fine-grained analysis of rare earth mining in northern Myanmar, this paper explores how critical mineral frontiers drive new forms of geographically uneven development and reveal the spatial effects of the green energy transition. Our research reveals how marginalised communities currently bear disproportionate social and environmental burdens for the green energy transition and emphasises that greater focus must be placed on who and where bears the costs of this transition by centring the needs and experiences of those living in green energy 'sacrifice zones'. We argue that if the notion of a just transition is to be meaningful in any serious and pro-poor way, it must confront how such sacrifice zones are produced and what can be done to promote social and environmental justice in these places.",Not About Sufficiency
The Measurements and Analysis of Spatial-Temporal Variations of Human Development Index Based on Planetary Boundaries in China: Evidence from Provincial-Level Data,"It is necessary to pursue the economic and social development of humanity to cope with the challenges of the global ecological environment within the constraints of planetary boundaries. For constructing the evaluation model of human development considering the earth pressure from the sub-national level, and observing the changes of human development level under the earth pressure in China in recent years, this paper constructs the PB-HDI (Planetary Boundaries-Human Development Index) index to measure the human development level under planetary boundaries in 30 Chinese provinces of 2010, 2014, 2017, and 2020; and carries out the analysis of evolutionary characteristics and spatial heterogeneity inspired by the path of balancing the relationship between environmental protection and economic development in China. We found: (1) the regional PB-HDI differences show a convergence trend, with a gradual decrease in low-level provinces; (2) the regional heterogeneity of PB-HDI is obvious. The differences between eastern provinces are the largest; (3) resources and environment constitute the outer circle of economic and social development, forming a ""doughnut"" inclusion pattern that discourages high-level development beyond the boundary and low-level development within the boundary. In general, there are significant differences in economic development, environmental protection level, social security capacity, industrial structure, innovation level, policy environment, and other basic conditions among different regions of China, and sustainable development paths need to be determined according to local conditions. This study is critical for expanding the application of the sub-national human development assessment for global stress and optimizing China's sustainable development path.",Not About Sufficiency
The long-term impacts of carbon and variable renewable energy policies on electricity markets,"We present a computationally-efficient optimization model that finds the least-cost generation unit expansion, commitment, and dispatch plan to serve hourly electricity demand and ancillary service requirements. We apply the model to a case study based on data from the electricity market in Texas (ERCOT) to analyze the market and investment impacts of several incentive mechanisms that support variable renewable energy (VRE) investments and carbon emission reductions. In contrast to many previous studies, the model determines least-cost VRE investments under different cost and incentive assumptions rather than analyzing scenarios where VRE expansion is pre-determined. We find that electricity prices can vary significantly under different incentive mechanisms, even when comparable generation portfolios result. Therefore, the preferred incentive mechanism depends on stakeholder objectives as well as the prevailing electricity market framework. Our results indicate that a carbon tax is more system cost-efficient for reducing emissions, while production and investment tax credits are more system cost-efficient for increasing VRE investments. Similarly, incentive mechanisms that reduce electricity prices may increase the need for separate revenue sufficiency mechanisms (e.g. a capacity market) more than a policy that increases electricity prices. Moreover, the impacts on consumer payments are not always aligned with changes in system costs. Overall, the analysis illustrates the importance of considering electricity market impacts in assessing the economic efficiency of VRE and carbon incentive mechanisms.",Not About Sufficiency
The justice and policy implications of clean energy transition in Africa,"Despite the low local energy access rates, Africa is considered a key player in the global energy transition due to its large supply of fossil fuels and a large reserve of critical minerals essential for manufacturing renewable energy components in the energy sector and storage devices in the transportation and electronics sectors. But building a sustainable society at all levels across nations would only come when there exists a just and inclusive energy transition based on the idea of ""leave no one behind"". While many African countries have embarked on ambitious and transformative transition strategies, and many energy projects classified as ""clean"" have economic, environmental, and social implications that jeopardize the wellbeing of those already vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This paper explores the policy implications of the just transition to ensure that efforts to steer Africa towards a lower carbon future are supported by fair, equity, and justice considerations. Our analyses provide valuable evidence for considering a just transition in Africa that will not exacerbate the current socio-economic challenges the region is facing but will support sustained poverty reduction and the achievement of faster economic growth. Our findings show that the African continent's multiple challenges of energy security, economic growth, and affordable access must feature in its clean energy transition. We draw conclusions that an incremental transition emphasizing low-carbon development is the most feasible and pragmatic approach to transform the region's economy and address climate change challenges.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Energy Poverty Alleviation on Carbon Emissions in Countries along the Belt and Road Initiative,"Energy poverty and climate change are global challenges. While the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has fostered energy cooperation and alleviated energy poverty in BRI countries, its impact on climate change requires careful examination. This study investigates the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions in BRI countries and analyzes the underlying mechanisms. In particular, this study constructs an integrated energy poverty assessment framework that includes three dimensions of energy accessibility, cleanliness, and affordability and utilizes the entropy-TOPSIS method to assess the status of energy poverty in 70 BRI countries. Subsequently, an empirical analysis using the Gini index as an instrumental variable was conducted to explore the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions and the specific mechanisms. It is found that alleviating energy poverty in BRI countries will lead to an increase in per capita carbon emissions. However, improving energy cleanliness is effective in reducing per capita carbon emissions, while improving energy affordability has no significant impact on carbon emissions. This study shows that energy poverty alleviation and carbon emission reduction are two non-conflicting sustainable development goals. BRI countries can synergize energy poverty alleviation and carbon emissions reduction by focusing on clean energy development and providing energy subsidies.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Circular Economy on Economic Development A Review of EU's Countries,"Over time, the concept of economic development has been the cause of debates in the research environment. Some of the researchers consider the level of economic development of a country to be characterized by high levels of the main macroeconomic aggregates, while another part supports the idea of uniform economic development with a high level of social inclusion. Regardless of the definition of the concept of economic development, it has been proven that a major positive impact is generated by the sustainable development strategy, especially in the light of the concept of circular economy. Therefore, the study addresses the level of economic development of the member states of the European Union based on the impact generated by the circular economy. In addition, based on the analysis carried out, the paper aims to identify the dependency ratio between the variables associated with the circular economy concept and the level of economic development. In order to achieve these goals, a panel regression model was estimated, for all member states of the European Union, on the time horizon 2011-2020. The model used as dependent variable ""the level of economic development"", and the independent variables were made up of variables associated with the circular economy. The results of this analysis reveal that there are individual effects on both dimensions associated with the analysis (cross-sectional, time series), which leads to the idea that each country is influenced in the process of economic development through the circular economy by its own specificities.",Not About Sufficiency
The hierarchy of resource use for a sustainable circular economy,"Purpose The original principles of the hierarchy of resource use seem to have been forgotten. The purpose of this paper is to address the necessity of these principles in order for a circular economy (CE) to be sustainable. Design/methodology/approach This is a general review paper explaining today's shortcomings in a CE and in the waste hierarchy. Its theoretical contribution is illustrated using the example of marine plastic waste in the Arctic, as well as the EU's action plan for a CE: ""Closing the loop"". Findings There is a need to reduce raw materials into the economy directly and not only as a potential result of recycling. This is supported theoretically and by illustrating that the EU's action plan is closing the loop primarily from the output side. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical possibility of complete recycling rests on a premise that is now at odds with a sustainable development. Social implications - The power of existing raw material production cycles must be challenged to allow reduction to be a real option. If not, a CE may exacerbate a moral trade-off by the current generation reducing the safe operating space of future living beings. Originality/value The theoretical possibility of recycling everything, also known as the technology-optimist view, has played the role of a safety net for humanity. As we are now exceeding planetary boundaries for a safe and just space for humanity, this theoretical safety net is no longer valid. Instead, we must reinforce the basic principles of the hierarchy of resource use.",Not About Sufficiency

Eleven years later, we re-examine these movements - the Cult of Wilderness, the Gospel of Eco-Efficiency and the Mantra of Environmental Justice, - focusing on the increased visibility of struggles representing Environmental justice and The Environmentalism of the Poor. Even if they are often disconnected from an organizational standpoint, glocal manifestations of resistance have emerged since the 1990s. Today, environmental movements assert common values related to place, identity, and culture. Activists' concepts such as ecological debt, environmental justice, environmental liabilities, land grabbing, environmental gentrification, corporate accountability, climate justice, food sovereignty, or economic degrowth are the keywords of the networks of the global Environmental justice movement. At the same time, such concepts support the rural and urban movements that remake place for marginalized groups, re-assert traditional practices, and protect territory from contamination, land appropriation, and real estate speculation. Some possibilities exist for cooperation between Environmental justice and the other varieties of environmentalism.

"The Environmental Injustice of ""Clean Coal'': Expanding the National Conversation on Carbon Capture and Storage Technology to Include an Analysis of Potential Environmental Justice Impacts","Over the past decade, the coal industry has created a multi-million dollar public relations campaign to insulate coal from the green energy revolution and the anticipated public backlash against dirty and unsustainable fuels. This campaign, promoting ""clean coal,'' has effectively shifted the national conversation on energy and climate change to situate coal as a viable clean energy source and the best option available to mitigate climate change. As the U.S. gets closer to passing national climate legislation and the deadline for achieving significant global reductions in carbon emissions draws near, opposition to the coal industry and its Clean Coal Campaign is organizing on a number of fronts. The environmental justice movement, through its leadership on climate justice, can serve as a centralizing force for these disparate advocacy efforts, bringing together students, scientists, policy advocates, community residents, and others engaged to fight clean coal and advance real green energy solutions. This article will look at the history of the Clean Coal Campaign and weigh the arguments for and against clean coal, focusing particularly on carbon capture and sequestration. It will then overview the advocacy efforts occurring across the U.S. to oppose coal and expose the fallacy of clean coal. Finally, it will defend the centralization of these efforts in an environmental justice-based climate justice movement that utilizes the varied resources, expertise and energy of the current advocacy efforts to stop coal and achieve a clean, green renewable energy economy.",Not About Sufficiency

The energy-climate-health nexus in energy planning: A case study in Brazil,"Global greenhouse gas emissions from energy production were approximately 40% higher in 2017 than in 2000 (International Energy Agency, 2018), and ambient particulate matter - one of the byproducts from fossil fuel combustion of most concern for public health - is now the fifth largest contributor to global disease (Cohen et al., 2017). Achieving the climate targets of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals requires better accounting for climate and health costs in energy planning. This paper quantifies trade-offs between selected energy infrastructure, climate, and health costs when meeting future electricity demand by increasing the share of renewable energy, with a focus on variable renewable energy (VRE; here: wind and solar photovoltaic power). Using a spatially and temporally resolved approach, we analyzed three scenarios for year 2030 for Northeast Brazil, characterized by 30%, 45%, and 70% of VRE (the latter corresponds to 100% renewable energy). We find that accounting for the health impacts from electricity generation is sufficient to economically justify deep decarbonization of Northeast Brazil's power sector. Full decarbonization is economically justified when the carbon price exceeds $20/tonne CO2, which is less than Brazil's country-level social cost of carbon and only 4.8% of the global social cost of carbon. Our study shows that regional climate and health costs from electricity generation alone can be greater than the additional infrastructure costs of decarbonization. Our results highlight how systematically accounting for health and climate costs in energy planning would economically justify the decarbonization of energy systems.",Not About Sufficiency

In this context, this study analyses the impact of several parameters (environmental matters, global warming, circular economy, energy and environmental taxes, and expenditure and investment on the environment) on life satisfaction, or subjective well-being, and their effects on 33 European countries. For this purpose, four econometric models were carried out using data collected from the World Values Survey (WVS), the European Values Study (EVS), and the World Bank and Eurostat, reflecting subjective citizen satisfaction data. The findings present a highly significant inverse relationship between life satisfaction variables and both environmental problems and energy taxes.

The Circular Economy: An Interdisciplinary Exploration of the Concept and Application in a Global Context,"There have long been calls from industry for guidance in implementing strategies for sustainable development. The Circular Economy represents the most recent attempt to conceptualize the integration of economic activity and environmental wellbeing in a sustainable way. This set of ideas has been adopted by China as the basis of their economic development (included in both the 11th and the 12th 'Five Year Plan'), escalating the concept in minds of western policymakers and NGOs. This paper traces the conceptualisations and origins of the Circular Economy, tracing its meanings, and exploring its antecedents in economics and ecology, and discusses how the Circular Economy has been operationalized in business and policy. The paper finds that while the Circular Economy places emphasis on the redesign of processes and cycling of materials, which may contribute to more sustainable business models, it also encapsulates tensions and limitations. These include an absence of the social dimension inherent in sustainable development that limits its ethical dimensions, and some unintended consequences.

"The AFOLU sector's role in national decarbonization: a comparative analysis of low-GHG development pathways in Brazil, India and Indonesia","This paper analyses the role that AFOLU (agriculture, forest and other land use) plays in national deep decarbonization scenarios in Brazil, India and Indonesia between 2020 and 2050. It finds that the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) subsector is important for medium-term mitigation (2020-2030) while continuing to contribute to mitigation over the long-term (2030-2050) in the three countries. Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15).

"The (FWE)<SUP>2</SUP> nexus: Bridging food, food waste, water, energy, and ecosystems for circular systems and sustainable development","Background: The imperative for sustainable resource management has become increasingly critical in the context of a rapidly expanding global population and heightened resource demands, compounded by the pressing challenges of climate change and environmental degradation. Traditional sector-specific approaches, which frequently isolate agriculture, energy, and water management, have proven inadequate in addressing the complex interdependencies inherent in resource ecosystems. In this regard, the Food, Food Waste, Water, Energy, and Ecosystems ((FWE)2) nexus framework emerges as a transformative paradigm that advocates for an integrated understanding of these interconnected components. This framework is essential for the implementation of comprehensive strategies designed to address the multifaceted sustainability challenges confronting contemporary society. Scope and Approach: The current research undertakes a comprehensive investigation of the (FWE)2 nexus framework, elucidating the dynamic interactions among food systems, waste management, water utilization, energy production, and ecosystem integrity. Through an extensive synthesis of the current literature, illustrative case studies, and empirical analyses, multifaceted dynamics inherent to the nexus were outlined. Key themes prominently featured include the necessity of conceptualizing food waste (FW) as a critical resource, the strategic deployment of technology to enhance operational efficiency, and the integration of circular economy principles to optimize resource utilization. Collectively, these elements advocate for sustainable practices that can yield substantive benefits for society and the environment. Policy implications and key findings: The (FWE)2 nexus framework is essential for tackling the intertwined challenges of food production, FW management, water resources, energy consumption, and ecosystem health. Policymakers should prioritize collaborative efforts that unite government agencies, businesses, and communities. This synergy can create comprehensive strategies that enhance resource governance and improve global food security. Additionally, initiatives focused on public education and community engagement are vital, empowering individuals to actively participate in sustainable resource management and fostering significant societal and environmental benefits. This research demonstrates the considerable potential of the (FWE)2 nexus framework in advancing several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Optimizing agricultural practices and reducing FW directly support SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by enhancing food security and nutrition. Furthermore, Considering FW as a valuable resource aligns with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), promoting sustainable consumption and waste reduction through circular economy principles that facilitate nutrient recovery and renewable energy generation. Moreover, effective FW management significantly contributes to SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) by promoting water conservation and improving water quality. The framework also underscores energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources in food production and waste management, thereby supporting SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). In addition, it plays a crucial role in SDG 13 (Climate Action) by reducing greenhouse gas emissions linked to food waste and resource overconsumption. By aligning these strategic efforts with the broader SDG framework, the (FWE)2 nexus framework actively contributes to the global sustainability agenda, offering actionable pathways toward sustainable development that benefit current and future generations.",Not About Sufficiency
Ten facts about land systems for sustainability,"Land use is central to addressing sustainability issues, including biodiversity conservation, climate change, food security, poverty alleviation, and sustainable energy. In this paper, we synthesize knowledge accumulated in land system science, the integrated study of terrestrial social-ecological systems, into 10 hard truths that have strong, general, empirical support. These facts help to explain the challenges of achieving sustainability in land use and thus also point toward solutions. The 10 facts are as follows: 1) Meanings and values of land are socially constructed and contested; 2) land systems exhibit complex behaviors with abrupt, hard-to-predict changes; 3) irreversible changes and path dependence are common features of land systems; 4) some land uses have a small footprint but very large impacts; 5) drivers and impacts of land-use change are globally interconnected and spill over to distant locations; 6) humanity lives on a used planet where all land provides benefits to societies; 7) land-use change usually entails trade-offs between different benefits-""win-wins"" are thus rare; 8) land tenure and land-use claims are often unclear, overlapping, and contested; 9) the benefits and burdens from land are unequally distributed; and 10) land users have multiple, sometimes conflicting, ideas of what social and environmental justice entails. The facts have implications for governance, but do not provide fixed answers. Instead they constitute a set of core principles which can guide scientists, policy makers, and practitioners toward meeting sustainability challenges in land use.",Not About Sufficiency
Tempering growth: planning for the challenges of climate change and growth management in SEQ,"South East Queensland (SEQ) has experienced voracious growth over the past five decades. Spanning some 200 km, this sprawling subtropical coastal conurbation is beginning to reach its ecological and socio-political limits. Over the last decade there have been concerted efforts to manage this growth with a new regime of plans and policies, but climate change has significantly complicated the challenge. This paper offers a preliminary analysis of the situation. The major climate adaptation challenges for the region are identified, including: rising sea levels, storm surges, higher temperatures, and increased freshwater scarcity. These will impact most on the elderly, sick and disadvantaged who have lower levels of resilience. The key plans and policies that address these issues are then reviewed, including: ClimateQ; the SEQ Regional Plan; and, the Draft SEQ Climate Change Management Plan. The overall planning regime is appraised in light of five core themes of strong ecological modernisation (technological innovation; engaging with economic imperatives; political and institutional change; transforming the role of social movements and discursive change) and the principles of environmental justice. It is argued that together these schools of thought could provide criteria for a more effective and equitable climate adaptation response for the region.",Not About Sufficiency
Hydropower’s Role in Enhancing Energy Justice: Preliminary Insights from the EU and Turkey,"This study examines recent energy transition policies and the conceptual framework of energy justice, emphasizing the role of hydropower, in ensuring the equitable distribution of energy services and burdens. The analysis focuses on the EU’s energy mix, highlighting the capacity of hydropower and its impact on energy justice, and examines the relationship between migration and energy poverty in countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey. In addition to their role as a source of renewable energy, hydropower offer a range of other benefits, including irrigation, flood control, water supply and fisheries. Despite these benefits, the construction of dams can also give rise to several social impacts, including environmental degradation, displacement of local communities and disruption to traditional livelihoods. The study concludes that hydropower remains critical to the EU’s transition to a sustainable and equitable energy system and supports social justice through improved energy access and security.",Not About Sufficiency
"Teachings of the People: Environmental Justice, Religion, and the Global South","The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Faith for Earth initiative calls for religiously inspired social action on local and global levels, focused on the seventeen interdependent sustainable development goals toward a just and peaceful world. Environmental justice must include an intersectional human rights approach to these issues by addressing the multiple and intersecting nature of lived experience, includ-ing gender, race, and socioeconomic status. My paper takes as its point of departure the UNEP Faith for Earth's recognition that environmental conditions have different impacts on the lives of men and women due to existing gender inequality. As both UN and UN Women have confirmed in their reports, women disproportionately suffer the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, especially in the global South. Environmental justice must address the critical link between envi-ronmental problems, and the rights of women and girls. Sustainable Development Goal five on gender equality includes addressing violence against women, sexual health and reproductive rights, and peace and security. I discuss how faith-based ini-tiatives, specifically Buddhist and African Indigenous Christian, have a positive role in grassroots environmental justice in the global South. My discussion includes the work of African Indigenous Christian, Nobel Laureate, and founder of the Greenbelt Movement, Dr. Wangari Muta Maathai, and the Theravada Thai lay Buddhist teacher and founder of the International Network of Engaged Buddhists, Sulak Sivaraksa. Their faith-based grassroots initiatives for environmental justice anticipate and are exemplary models for the UNEP Faith for Earth call to action. They emphasize a 'think global, act local' approach to environmental justice, by drawing on the wisdom and teachings of the people.

China’s Sustainable Energy Transition Path to Low-Carbon Renewable Infrastructure Manufacturing under Green Trade Barriers,"Facing green trade barriers from developed nations, particularly the EU, based on product carbon footprints, China’s renewable energy industries confront significant challenges in transitioning towards sustainability and low carbon emissions. This study delves into the carbon footprint of China’s renewable infrastructure, evaluating wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) panels, and lithium batteries across varied decarbonization scenarios, emphasizing both production and international trade transportation. The initial findings for 2022 indicate baseline carbon footprints of 990,701 kg CO2-eq/MW for wind turbines, 2994.97 kg CO2-eq/kWp for PV panels, and 67.53 kg CO2-eq/kWh for batteries. Projections for 2050 suggest that decarbonization advancements could slash these footprints by up to 36.1% for wind turbines, 76.7% for PV panels, and 72.5% for batteries, closely mirroring the EU’s 2050 low-carbon benchmarks. Considerable carbon footprints from both domestic and international transportation have been quantified, underscoring the importance of logistic decarbonization. Based on these results, it is concluded that China’s steadfast commitment to a sustainable and climate-ambitious development path can provide globally competitive, low-carbon renewable infrastructure after 2030. The study advocates for a collaborative approach to product decarbonization across international trade, as opposed to erecting barriers, to effectively contribute to global climate objectives.",Not About Sufficiency
East Asian newly industrializing countries: Economic growth and quality of life,"The world is much impressed by the rapid economic development of four Asian Tigers - Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. However, it has often been taken for granted by many people that their social development is equally satisfactory. In order to investigate whether this belief is true or not, this paper looks at the levels of social development these countries have attained. Various measures of their quality of life will be assessed. Specifically, poverty, income distribution and environmental degradation are discussed. Despite their economic success, this study has found that most tigers are plagued by problems of poverty, increasing income disparities and environmental degradation. Further, social expenditures of these countries have been too limited to eliminate or impact on these problems.",Not About Sufficiency
"Ageism, welfare, and the energy transition: a comparative analysis of the perceptions among the elderly in Poland and Norway","BackgroundOne of the potential dimensions on which exclusion and injustice may occur in energy transitions is age. Age-based patterns of exclusion—ageism—has recently been conceptualized in the context of decarbonization as energy ageism. This paper offers a comparative empirical analysis of the senior citizens’ outlook towards an imminent energy transition as well as the impact of energy poverty in two European countries: Norway and Poland.ResultsDrawing on interviews and focus groups with Polish and Norwegian seniors, we present the differences and similarities between the two countries, and the determinants of energy ageism, as well as the concept’s overall applicability and empirical usefulness. We find that socioeconomic conditions outweigh ageism, that is, the resilience of senior citizens in dealing with energy poverty during a transition is conditioned by their material standing and welfare state robustness rather than age based. An important factor is household heating technology, combined with economic vulnerability can push some individuals into energy poverty, while others using alternative sources of heat can navigate through energy crises unscathed.ConclusionsWe note the importance of mainstreaming social inclusion considerations in energy policy and of targeted digital competence building which can enhance senior citizen integration in the energy transition. Lower levels of digital competences among senior citizens certainly play a role and need to be addressed with education programs to increase participation. In both countries, household heating is a major issue and heating sources are strong predictors of energy poverty and regulatory measures and subsidies should be designed at national, regional, and municipal level to assist vulnerable groups in this area.",Not About Sufficiency
The Development of Biogas Production in the Context of Energy Transition: The Case of Poland,"Objective: The aim of this article is to identify the chances of further development of biogas production as a way to diverisfy the structure of energy production in Poland. Another one is to analyse biogas production as a part of getting closer to achieving the targets of the climate and energy framework of the European Union and Polish long-term energy sector strategies. Research Design & Methods: The research methods used in the study include: the analysis and study of the literature, heuristic techniques for data analysis, the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Findings: The production of biogas can be beneficial for local economic growth, environmental awareness, and social wellbeing. There is a strong need to overcome the barriers of further development of biogas production as well as analyse the opportunities, given that a type of renewable energy source is further developed. Biogas production can help meet the national and international goals concerning energy transition, developing low-carbon economies, and addressing modern economic trends. Implications / Recommendations: The aim of this paper is to investigate the chances of further development of biogas production in spite of current changes in Polish agendas. The topic is of great importance when analysing the strategy of Poland to develop a low-carbon economy. It is also a significant part of current discussions between the scientific community and business practitioners in terms of energy transition in Poland. What is worth noting is that Polish strategies concerning the development of renewable energy production should be aligned with the climate and energy targets of the European Union, which can prove problematic. Polish energy mix is still based on energy production from coal, while the EU is steadily increasing gross energy production from renewable energy sources. Contribution / Value Added: The analysis defines the role of biogas in circular economy as well as in modern economy with the consideration of environmental economics and sustainable development. It underlines the importance of biogas in energy transition in Poland, taking into consideration the Energy Policy of Poland until 2040 (Pol.

Systematic review of circular economy strategy outcomes in the automobile industry,"Circular economy (CE) activities are expected to deliver emission and resource benefits to the automobile industry while increasing economic competitiveness and social well-being. However, assessing the impact of these benefits has been challenging due to the variability in methodologies and assumptions used in previous studies. Considering this, we conducted a systematic review of 192 peer-reviewed studies to comprehensively synthesize the impact of five types of CE strategies on the automobile sector, focusing on five environmental and socio-economic outcomes. Our findings reveal that only a minority of studies investigated social outcomes (16%) and integrated dynamic aspects into the impact assessment (10%). While the impact direction analysis indicates that the five CE strategies generally have positive environmental impacts, we identified trade-offs in economic competitiveness associated with lightweighting through material substitution and human well-being issues related to lifetime extension. Furthermore, we identified factors such as transport, materials, and energy sources that contribute to backfire effects on global warming. Our systematic review emphasizes the importance of developing sophisticated assessment methods and overcoming potential trade-offs and backfire effects when employing CE strategies for carbon neutrality in the automobile industry.",Not About Sufficiency
Drought hazard in Morocco,"Drought hazard has been increasing because of the extension of cultivation into marginal low-rainfall areas and because of reduction of fallow.

Sustainable intensification and carbon sequestration research in agricultural systems: A systematic review,"Mitigation pathways that stabilise global warming to 1.5 degrees C describe rapidly increasing deployment of landbased solutions, including increased carbon sequestration in soils and biomass. This places additional demands on land, which is also required to provide food security and other ecosystem services. Sustainable Intensification (SI) of agriculture has the potential to facilitate meeting demands for food and fibre, while simultaneously meeting environmental and ecological goals. The scientific literature has most often addressed the challenge of SI separately to climate change mitigation objectives in agricultural systems. Using a systematic review approach, we explored the compatibility of SI and carbon sequestration research through two contrasting case studies: Case Study I on Grassland Agriculture in Europe, and Case Study II on Smallholder Agriculture in Africa. We find contrasting levels of research theme similarity for SI and carbon sequestration, with European grassland agriculture research having lower similarity compared with African smallholder agriculture research. There was a focus on minimising biodiversity loss and environmental impacts in Europe, in contrast to a food security emphasis in Africa, reflecting regional and development differences. While there are clear context and agricultural-system specific differences between both case studies, both suggest that sustainable land use policies can be used to achieve SI integrated with climate mitigation in agriculture.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable energy planning for remote islands and the waste legacy from renewable energy infrastructure deployment,"The transition towards a sustainable energy mix is required to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7 for affordable and clean energy. Remote islands not connected to grid which depend on diesel generators may appear ideal because they can benefit from a variety of renewable energy sources. However, renewable energy deployment requires a lifetime perspective to not inherit waste and other problems to future generations. The aim of this paper is to present a life cycle sustainability framework developed and applied for the case of the island of Ushant off North West France. Seven renewable energy generation scenarios were examined and assessed using technoeconomic, social and environmental indicators utilising life cycle costing and life cycle assessment modelling. The results show that only three out of the seven examined renewable energy scenarios manage to cover the 6807 MWh per annum demand. These scenarios can improve all the indicators against the business-as-usual diesel generation scenario except the ones related to toxicity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 92%. The easy-to-use framework allows the users to adjust their scenarios and receive useful insight about the nature of the trade-offs between the various indicators. It can also be adapted and updated to include more technologies and support the investigation of more sustainable energy scenarios of other remote island cases in the future. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Sustainable Development as Freedom: Trends and Opportunities for the Circular Economy in the Human Development Literature,"This paper identifies, through a literature review, how 53 circular economy (CE) practices are related to the capability approach (CA) proposed by Sen. The main goal was to identify how a virtuous cycle between CE and CA can be developed. Five instrumental freedoms (IF) were analysed: economic facilities, social opportunities, protective security, political freedoms, and transparency guarantees. These relationships were analysed in three flows: CE practices positively impacting IF, CE practices negatively impacting IF, and the feedback influence of IF on CE practices. The results show that 32 of the 53 practices previously mentioned have not yet been studied from the CA context, which indicates that there are several research opportunities. From the practices considered, 72 articles were analysed in the final sample. The results suggest that several CE practices are aligned with the CA, considering that all five IF were identified as positive outcomes of CE practices. However, in some contexts, certain practices can have negative outcomes, which indicates that CE, at least in some cases, may not be considered as sustainable, as it decreases IF and, therefore, the social aspect of sustainability. The results also highlight that there is a feedback from IF to CE, in such a way that investing in the expansion of IF can facilitate the development of CE practices. Therefore, this study concludes that CE is indeed a way to fully operationalize sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable Development and the Agenda of Global Social Justice,"This chapter explores the concept of ""just sustainability"". The notions of ""sustainability"" and ""social justice"" share the common agenda of conservation of nature. As per the Brundtland report, sustainability is conceived as a test of humanity's ability to meet ""the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"". However, there are different paradigms of sustainability in the literature, namely the ""green"" or environmental agenda and the ""social justice"" focused ""brown"" or poverty reduction agenda. While the more immediate focus of social justice and/or environmental justice (both social justice and environmental justice focus on distributive conceptions of justice: human security issues related to justice, equity, human rights, and poverty reduction, and so on) is intragenerational, the more pressing focus of sustainability is intergenerational. The agendas of ""social justice"" and ""sustainability"" thus seem to be conflicting. In this chapter, I focus on the interdependency of social justice/ environmental justice and ""sustainability"" even when sustainability is framed as green environment and social justice focuses on the brown social agenda of poverty reduction. The paper builds on the argument that unless global social justice (intragenerational access) is ensured under a fair social and institutional arrangement, the relationship of economic growth with sustainable development will always remain contentious and sustainable development will remain a mere ideal. I conclude that organisations and institutions must explore the common ground between justice and sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable agrobiorefinery system for advanced ethanol production from Opuntia prickly pear cactus nopales,"Cleaner industrial bioethanol production from sustainable biomass could support the circular economy to achieve Sustainable Development Goals while tackling climate change. Ethanol from the arid plants nopales (prickly pear, Opuntia ficus-indica) offers promising benefits for energy transition, water conservation and food security. However, the environmental impact and energy efficiency of nopal farming and ethanol production in plant-wide biorefineries are unknown. Inorganic production and the classic biorefinery cause undesirable environmental impacts that could be assessed to design better systems. Experiments and analyses of scenarios were performed to propose a cleaner and more energy-efficient farming and ethanol production in a plant-wide biorefinery. Four realistic scenarios considered two fertilisers, two pretreatments and two operational modes. Then, life cycle assessment, energy balances and energy efficiency principles were applied. Scenario 1 was environmentally harmful and energy inefficient (inorganic production and classic biorefinery). Scenario 4 is the cleanest and most energy-efficient (organic fertilisers and ionic liquids with acetone washing in a loop process). Scenario 4 showed the lowest impacts across all categories assessed, including global warming, acidification and eutrophication potentials (1.5 kg eq CO2, 0.004 kg eq SO2 and 0.0006 kg eq PO4, respectively). This enhanced system used the lowest amount of energy (0.33 MJMJethanolproduced-1) and showed the best energy efficiency when converting input energy into net energy as ethanol fuel (three-fold of that of scenario 1).

Sustainability evaluation based on the Three-dimensional Ecological Footprint and Human Development Index: A case study on the four island regions in China,"Sustainable development emphasizes the sustainability of natural resources and the environment as well as the development of social welfare. Under the background of resource scarcity and environmental constraints, maximizing social welfare is an inevitable choice to achieve sustainable development. Ecological Wellbeing Performance (EWP) can comprehensively reflect the efficiency of natural capital conversion into social welfare, and improving EWP is a feasible measure to achieve sustainable development. Moreover, island areas are the extremely complicated ecological-social-economic systems due to the traits that are geographical isolation, scarce resources, and frequent natural disasters, so that emphasizing the sustainability of island systems is a key step for achieving sustainable development goals. This study developed the EWP model based on the improved Three-dimensional Ecological Footprint (EF) and urban-scale Human Development Index (HDI), to synthetically evaluate and analyze the sustainable development of four major island regions in China with the data in 2017. Results found that: (1) The four regions are all in ecological deficits, being in exchange for overdraft natural capital for economic development. The EFdepth is greater than the original length 1 indicating the excessive consumption of the natural capital stock. The EFsize reflects the abundance and liquidity of regional natural capital, all the four regions are with the generally low level of flow capital utilization. Hainan with highest EFsize 0.428 is due to its comparatively sparse population density, abundant resources, and strong ecological capacity, while the relatively large population density and more restricted natural capital flows make Taiwan in the lowest value. (2) Judging from the evaluation results of the HDI, Chongming (0.796) and Hainan (0.773) high development level are relatively behind Taiwan (0.912) and Zhoushan (0.827) very high development level, for the impact of income is greater, that is, economic development in Hainan and Chongming is slightly weak. (3) Taiwan, with the highest EWP 3.646, shows the excellent natural resource utilization efficiency and sustainability, followed by Zhoushan, Chongming, and Hainan. In general, increasing HDI while reducing EF can be an ideal way to improve the efficiency of ecological resources and achieve sustainable urban development.",Not About Sufficiency
"Enclave-Reinforced Inequality during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from University Campus Lockdowns in Wuhan, China","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted urban life and created spatial and social inequalities in cities. The impacts of lifting full lockdown restrictions once fast-spreading and community-acquired infection waves were under control are still not fully understood. This study aims to explore spatial inequality reinforced in the intervals between the waves of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Enclave-reinforced inequality resulting from enclave-based lockdown policies in Chinese cities was investigated through an analysis of the impacts of university campus enclave closures on the accessibility and crowdedness of urban green spaces. Using a modified two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and inversed 2SFCA (i2SFCA) method, accessibility and crowdedness were calculated and compared under two different scenarios. Additionally, the Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, and Theil index were used to measure and compare intra-city global and local inequalities under each scenario. The results indicate that the lockdown of university campus enclaves decreased the supply of urban green spaces. Campus closures not only exacerbated the unequal distribution of urban green space, but also reduced the inequality of crowdedness in urban parks due to increased crowdedness in parks near the closed enclaves. Moreover, both accessibility and crowdedness worsened when the calculations were weighted for population size and the total supply of green space. Enclave-based lockdown in cities reinforced spatial inequality, and it is highly complex and has multidimensional impacts on urban inequalities and environmental injustice which should be considered by urban planners and decision-makers hoping to create healthy, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable cities in the “new normal” of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Not About Sufficiency
Habitat Occupancy of the Critically Endangered Chinese Pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) Under Human Disturbance in an Urban Environment: Implications for Conservation,"ABSTRACTGlobally, urban expansion has led to habitat fragmentation and altered resource availability, thus posing significant challenges for wildlife. The Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) is a critically endangered species experiencing population decline due to illegal trade and habitat degradation. This study analyzed variables affecting habitat occupancy of Chinese pangolins using a single‐season occupancy model across 134 study grids (600 m × 600 m) in peri‐urban areas of Dharan Sub‐Metropolitan City, eastern Nepal. We identified termite mounds as a significant key factor (top model with AICwt = 1) in the detection probability of Chinese pangolin burrows (βTermite mounds = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.89). Additionally, the Human Disturbance Index (HDI) emerged as the key variable for habitat use occupancy (AIC = 231.96, AICwt = 0.309), indicating a significant negative impact (βHDI = −6.555, 95% CI = −11.324 to −1.7723). We observed a mean HDI of 0.475 ± 0.04 in the grids where Chinese pangolins were detected, with higher HDI values correlating with reduced Chinese pangolin occupancy. For the long‐term conservation of Chinese pangolins in urban landscapes, it is crucial to reduce anthropogenic activities and implement conservation measures to protect suitable habitats with abundant termite mounds.",Not About Sufficiency

Study on energy-autonomous technology for energy consumption performance and climate adaptation in independent public toilets based on DesignBuilder simulation,"To enhance energy efficiency and climatic adaptation, this study explores the potential of energy-autonomous technology (EAT) in independent public toilets. Many public toilets today suffer from significant resource wastage due to reliance on external electricity, water, and sewage systems. EAT aims to address these issues by efficiently managing toilet energy requirements. Using DesignBuilder software, we simulated and analyzed energy consumption under various climatic conditions. The results highlight that Nanning, with its strong sun irradiation and mild temperatures, exhibits a daily peak energy use of around 3.25 kWh, making it ideal for implementing such technologies. In sunny but colder locations like Xining, there are also notable advantages. Tianjin, with an effective heat gain of approximately 3,090 MJ, demonstrates significant annual energy generation. Significant emission reductions were observed in Lhasa, emphasizing the environmental benefits of EAT. This research contributes academically by providing a comprehensive analysis of EAT performance in different climates, filling a gap in the existing literature regarding the application of EAT in public toilets. Practically, it offers a novel solution for promoting hygienic facilities in water-scarce or underdeveloped areas, where access to conventional sanitation is limited. From a policy perspective, our findings support the adoption of renewable energy strategies that align with broader environmental goals, such as reducing CO2 emissions. By demonstrating the effectiveness of EAT in diverse geographic settings, this study underscores its potential to contribute to sustainable development and improved public health infrastructure.",Not About Sufficiency

Stepping into the just transition journey: The energy transition in petrostates,"With the transition towards a low carbon economy underway, the notion of ensuring that it is a just transition - one that is fair and equitable - has captured significant attention in recent decades. Although petrostates are a central part of the fossil fuel-based global economy, they have been largely ignored in discussions of a just transition. This article explores what should characterize a just transition in petrostates, as they face challenges that are distinct from those faced by major producers of other fossil fuels such as coal. We argue that the just transition should be understood comprehensively to cover climate, energy, and environmental justice. Economic reforms, particularly investment diversification, institutional reforms, and the inclusion of women, youth populations and indigenous people are practical steps for achieving a just transition within petrostates. The importance of this research is to highlight that petrostates need to begin their just transition journey. There is limited time for this to happen, and taking steps into the just transition journey will have many benefits as identified in this research such as, socio-economic, impact on public health and an increase in inwardinvestments. The research involves utilizing the energy justice framework and assessing the five energy justice principles: procedural, distributive, restorative, recognition and cosmopolitan. In order to assess these we utilize data from the United Nations and World Bank to explore the key issues as asset diversification, employment and recognition issues. Finally, a just transition pathway is presented for petrostates to follow on the basis of the results.",Not About Sufficiency
Statistics on China's 1996 social development.,"1996 statistics released by China's State Statistical Bureau reflect the level of social development. Statistics are provided on education, health, population, income, employment, housing, social welfare, and environmental degradation. The number of higher education institutions declined slightly between 1995 and 1996. In 1996 there were 1032 universities and colleges and 1138 adult education higher learning institutions. The number of students enrolled in universities and colleges increased by 40,000 to 966,000. The total university population numbered 3.02 million in 1996. Increases in students occurred in adult education and graduate schools. Secondary vocational education expanded to 10.1 million students, or 56.8% of all senior middle school students. The 50.48 million junior middle school students represent an enrollment rate of 82.4%. The 136.15 million primary school students represent a 98.8% enrollment rate. About 4.07 million adults gained literacy. Preventive health work and rural public health work were strengthened in 1996. The birth rate in 1996 was 16.98/1000. The death rate was 6.56/1000. The 1996 end-of-the-year population was 1.22389 billion, an increase of 12.68 million over 1995. 29.4% were urban residents. The average family size was 3.70. 26.4% were children aged 0-14 years, and 9.4% were aged over 65 years. The average annual disposable income per capita was 4839 yuan for urban residents, 6235 yuan in provincial capital cities, and 1926 yuan for rural residents. Rural residents received the highest increase in income (9%) at constant prices. 688.5 million people were employed, of which 149.6 million were urban workers. The labor force increased by 9 million people during the year. 360 million sq. m of new buildings were added in urban areas in 1996; 760 million sq. m were added in rural areas.",Not About Sufficiency
Stakeholder-driven evaluation of the impact of land reform programme on landscape changes using earth observation data,"South Africa’s land reform aimed to rectify historical land dispossession from colonial and apartheid policies, but the associated land use land cover (LULC) changes are under-researched. This study uses remote sensing and stakeholder perspectives to analyse the impact of the Salem Commonage land reform on LULC. Landsat images from 1986 to 2023 were analysed, supplemented by oral histories and perceptions of current trends. The LULC map accuracy ranged from 86–95%, validating the results. Findings showed built-up areas increased from 6.1–18.5%, while cultivated land decreased from 25–12.6%. The study observed deforestation and more bare land, indicating possible land degradation due to new ownership practices. Historical narratives and the results confirmed from Landsat image analysis were consistent with local land users’ views in this study, providing a socio-political context for these LULC changes. Stakeholders linked LULC changes to housing demands for marginalised communities, which prioritise housing over agriculture. Sub-division of large lands into smaller plots discourages farming, and new landowners’ limited capital hampers agricultural production. The study highlighted the importance of explaining LULC changes through stakeholder perceptions. The shift from farming to built-up areas reflects broader challenges in land reform, including poverty alleviation and limited agricultural support. Policies should integrate land-use planning, training, and financial aid to sustain rural livelihoods while addressing housing needs. This study provides valuable insights that can enhance sustainable land management strategies, particularly by addressing challenges arising from land reform outcomes. Furthermore, promoting equitable land use practices after reform will benefit the international scientific community, development practitioners, city planners, and other relevant stakeholders.",Not About Sufficiency

Coming to terms: toward a North-South bargain for the environment.,"To attack the major environmental problems, global warming, natural resource losses, and loss of biological diversity, an understanding between the industrialized and developing countries must occur. Weather patterns and sea levels are being affected by global warming which is caused by the use of fossil fuels and deforestation. The industrialized countries must cut back on the use of fossil fuels, and developing countries need to slow the process of deforestation. The loss of genetic resources and the extinction of species is happening rapidly, and most of it is in the tropical forests of developing countries. The developing countries are more dependent on their natural resources, forests, minerals, soils, and fisheries than industrialized countries. They are being depleted more rapidly with the population growth, social inequalities, and poor policies. Industrial countries are partly to blame also since they make investment and development decisions without concerns for the environment. The 4 major actions that can be initiated by industrialized countries are as follows. The initiation of national and international movements to reduce gas emissions that cause the greenhouse effect. The increased distribution of new technology and financing for population programs, sustainable development and environmental protection. The reduction of the external dept of developing countries, and the creation of programs to give technical assistance, scientific and other training for environmental problems of developing countries. Financial assistance can be linked to population programs and to environmental issues of the developing countries. Carbon dioxide taxes could be used to finance forest management and ecological zoning. The exchange of forest conservation for debt relief is a possible solution. Any dept restructuring plan should include strong environmental conservation provisions and policy reform requirements.",Not About Sufficiency

Spatializing Urban Forests as Nature-based Solutions: a methodological proposal,"The Fifth Session of the UNEA-5 defines Nature-based Solutions (NbS) as ""actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems, which address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem services and resilience and biodiversity benefits"". A large number of the EU HORIZON 2020 research program projects include the implementation of NbS in urban settings. The proGIreg project implemented several NbS for urban regeneration with and for citizens in its Living Lab in the city of Turin (Italy), among others. Focusing on the NbS of urban forestry, this paper addresses the following question: where can NbS be implemented within the city, in order to maximize their social impact? To achieve this goal, by identifying neighborhoods in need of NbS implementation, the 3-30-300 rule proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) was adopted and implemented, taking greater account of environmental and social characteristics. The paper also proposes an index to identify neighborhoods of the city that could have precedence in the implementation of NbS. The results highlight 10 neighborhoods where there is a high need of NbS implementation.",Not About Sufficiency
"The political economy of net-zero transitions: policy drivers, barriers, and justice benefits to decarbonization in eight carbon-neutral countries","This research looks at the political economics of decarbonization in eight nations that have already made the transition to a net-zero economy. Bhutan, Surname, Panama, Guyana, Comoros, Gabon, Madagascar, and Niue are among these nations. It makes use of an analytical approach that combines thematic analysis with a thorough, multidisciplinary, and organized assessment of the literature. The study looked at the political motivation and driving forces behind net-zero progress for each of these nations, as well as the benefits of decarbonization and its effects on equality and justice, as well as the historical background and obstacles that had to be overcome. This study's primary goals are to provide new empirical data on the strategy of energy policies in the real world by looking at the first eight countries to achieve net-zero success in the modern era. The study expanded the body of evidence on low-carbon transitions beyond the frequently and even over studied countries known as Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democracies or WEIRD countries. It is discovered that the nine policy interventions pertaining to waste management, renewable energy, and land use were employed in a comparable manner by all eight countries. Vulnerability to the impacts of catastrophic climate events, such as flooding and landslides, or the deterioration of ecosystems was a common barrier. Despite challenges, achieving netzero emissions positively impacts marginalized communities by distributing climate benefits more fairly, reducing health effects, and reducing social inequalities, especially in lowincome areas.",Not About Sufficiency

These countries are Bhutan, Suriname, Panama, Guyana, Comoros, Gabon, Madagascar, and Niue. It utilizes an analytical method of a rich, interdisciplinary and systematized literature review integrated with thematic analysis. For each of these countries, the study examines the drivers and political motivation behind net-zero progress, including the timeline of events; the barriers and challenges that had to be overcome; and the benefits of decarbonization and its impacts on equity and justice. The main objectives of the study are to broaden the evidence base on low-carbon transitions beyond often and even overstudied countries that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democracies, or WEIRD countries, and to offer new empirical data on the strategy of energy policies in the real world, examining the first eight countries to achieve net-zero success in the modern era. It finds that all eight countries used a similar mix of nine policy interventions involving land use, renewable energy, and waste management. Common barriers included vulnerability to the effects of extreme climate events either in the form of natural disasters (i.e. landslides and floodings) or ecosystems degradation (i.e. ocean acidification, coastal erosion and forests loss). Despite these barriers, achieving net-zero emissions positively impacted marginalized communities by providing a more equitable distribution of climate benefits, mitigating adverse health effects and reducing social inequalities, particularly in low-income areas.This study examines the political economy of decarbonization in eight countries over the period 2000 to 2021/2022 that have already achieved a national net-zero transition.

Solar potential for social benefit: Maps to sustainably address energy poverty utilizing open spatial data in data poor settings,"Access to affordable sustainable energy is a significant challenge for many low-income countries experiencing energy poverty. The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 aims to ""ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all."" Simultaneously, the European Union (EU) seeks to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030. Decarbonization policies must be carefully considered to avoid adverse effects on vulnerable groups experiencing energy poverty. Solar technology offers a viable solution to decarbonize the building sector, reduce energy dependence on fossil fuels, and provide financial benefits to the public. Mapping solar potential is crucial to determine where investment in solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is most advantageous to the populations who stand to benefit the most. We combine a solar potential mapping approach incorporating socio-economic indicators indicative of energy poverty, using off-the-shelf Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools that are easily replicated across cities facing energy poverty. Utilizing lowest common denominator data and analysis approaches, we offer creative and innovative mapping solutions. The socioeconomic factors help to contextualise the benefits of distributed PV systems and highlight the need for mapping solar potential, in combination with energy poverty indicators for sustainable planning and policymaking. Our results for a case study in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria, demonstrate high solar energy potential that could meet 29% of the city's electricity needs, save citizens about M<euro>43.84 annually, and pinpoint where to invest first for the highest gains. Finally, we offer suggestions on how to use these results to inform decarbonization policies to benefit low-income populations that are often missed in existing energy policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Tax measures to reduce food losses and waste in the United States and the European Union: a comparative analysis,"La meta 12.3 de la Agenda 2030 de las Naciones Unidas (ONU) es la siguiente ""Para 2030, reducir a la mitad el desperdicio mundial de alimentos per cápita a nivel de minoristas y consumidores y reducir las pérdidas de alimentos a lo largo de las cadenas de producción y suministro, incluidas las pérdidas posteriores a la cosecha."" La implementación de las metas específicas de la Agenda 2030 de la ONU, como ésta, supone un reto importante, ya que requieren acciones inmediatas, políticas públicas adecuadas y una colaboración sin precedentes entre entidades privadas, públicas y países. La meta 12.3 está intrínsecamente relacionada con muchas otras metas, por lo que su consecución tiene un impacto directo en varias de ellas. Por lo tanto, es vital alcanzarla con éxito, no sólo para reducir el hambre, sino también para lograr muchos otros objetivos de la Agenda y, en particular, para poder reducir nuestra huella medioambiental. La Prevención de Pérdidas y Desperdicios de Alimentos (FLW) es un objetivo dentro de la Economía Circular que puede considerarse central, ya que el objetivo 12.3 trata de prevenir la sobreproducción de alimentos con una mejor redistribución que no sólo reduzca los insumos, sino que también intente minimizar los desperdicios mediante la donación de productos alimentarios a entidades de la Economía Social (ES) que ayudan a los más necesitados. Dado que la Economía Circular contribuye a la resolución de los tres problemas ambientales más acuciantes la sobreexplotación de recursos, el calentamiento global y la pérdida de biodiversidad, además de todos los impactos negativos derivados de estos (ONU Medio Ambiente, 2019) prevenir las pérdidas y desperdicios de alimentos es también clave para asegurar la solución tanto de un profundo problema social, como de salud pública, además de los más importantes problemas medioambientales. A pesar de que resulta evidente la urgencia de una acción inmediata, diversos académicos, como Martín Río, Rogenhofer y Sandoval Alvarado (2022), destacan que la atención que este objetivo recibe por parte de la doctrina sigue siendo escasa. Por ello, el propósito de este trabajo es comparar estas políticas a ambos lados del Atlántico, proponer recomendaciones y ayudar a concienciar sobre el problema de las pérdidas y el desperdicio alimentario, siguiendo un enfoque holístico para todos los posibles actores implicados, ya que la comunicación es fundamental para alcanzar este objetivo. En este trabajo se presta especial atención a las políticas fiscales en los casos en los que se donan alimentos a Entidades de Economía Social como bancos de alimentos, fundaciones sin ánimo de lucro o comedores sociales, ya que los tributos pueden actuar como barreras o como facilitadores para alcanzar este objetivo; por lo tanto, es crucial aplicar las políticas tributarias correctamente para garantizar que actúan como verdaderos facilitadores.

Multiple pathways towards sustainable development goals and climate targets,"The UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris climate target require a holistic transformation towards human well-being within planetary boundaries. However, there are growing debates on how to best pursue these targets. Proposed transformation strategies include market- and technology-driven green-growth, shifting towards a sufficiency-oriented post-growth economy, and a transformation driven primarily by strong government action. Here we quantify three alternative sustainable development pathways (SDPs), Economy-driven Innovation, Resilient Communities, and Managing the Global Commons, that reflect these different societal strategies. We compare the quantifications from two integrated assessment models and two sectoral models of the buildings and materials sectors across a broad set of indicators for sustainable development and climate action. Our global multi-scenario and multi-model analysis shows that all three SDPs enable substantial progress towards the human development goals of the SDGs. They simultaneously limit global warming and prevent further environmental degradation, with the sufficiency-oriented Resilient Communities scenario showing the lowest peak warming and lowest reliance on carbon dioxide removal as well as the largest improvements in biodiversity intactness. The SDPs also alleviate the concerns about the biogeophysical and technological feasibility of narrowly-focused climate change mitigation scenarios. However, the shifts in energy and food consumption patterns assumed in the SDPs, ranging from moderate in Economy-driven Innovation to very ambitious in Resilient Communities, also lead to increased challenges regarding socio-cultural feasibility.",Not About Sufficiency
Socio-economic sustainability with circular economy - An alternative approach,"As the global population and living standards rise, it pushes the demand for basic amenities like food, health, and energy resources. Additionally, manufacturing automation has led to mass production and consumption, triggering waste production. The existing linear economy approach has led to increasing waste production and resource depletion, posing significant environmental and public health threats. To overcome these impediments, an alternative model called the circular economy concept has gained popularity in the global industry community. This closed-loop, restorative, waste-free concept has the potential to protect the environment and improve economics by reducing energy and resource consumption. Thus, major impetus should be given to strengthening the backbone of the economy where tools such as green technologies, decarbonization strategies, bio refinery processes, material flow analysis, life cycle assessment, ecological footprints (water, carbon, and material), substance flow analysis, circularity index, eco-designing, bioresource management, new business models, and policy play an essential role in the areas of socio-economic sustainability, ecological facts, and industrial aspects to enhance socio-economic growth in a sustainable manner.

"Socioeconomic influences on biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being: A quantitative application of the DPSIR model in Jiangsu, China","One focus of ecosystem service research is the connection between biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being as well as the socioeconomic influences on them. Despite existing investigations, exact impacts from the human system on the dynamics of biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being are still uncertain because of the insufficiency of the respective quantitative analyses. Our research aims are discerning the socioeconomic influences on biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being and demonstrating mutual impacts between these items. We propose a DPSIR framework coupling ecological integrity, ecosystem services as well as human well-being and suggest DPSIR indicators for the case study area Jiangsu, China. Based on available statistical and surveying data, we revealed the factors significantly impacting biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being in the research area through factor analysis and correlation analysis, using the 13 prefecture-level cities of Jiangsu as samples. The results show that urbanization and industrialization in the urban areas have predominant positive influences on regional biodiversity, agricultural productivity and tourism services as well as rural residents' living standards. Additionally, the knowledge, technology and finance inputs for agriculture also have generally positive impacts on these system components. Concerning regional carbon storage, non-cropland vegetation cover obviously plays a significant positive role. Contrarily, the expansion of farming land and the increase of total food production are two important negative influential factors of biodiversity, ecosystem's food provisioning service capacity, regional tourism income and the well-being of the rural population. Our study provides a promising approach based on the DPSIR model to quantitatively capture the socioeconomic influential factors of biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being for human-environmental systems at regional scales.

Our findings suggest that the intended decarbonization policy, aimed at accelerating technology transfer, may not always reduce carbon emissions. However, incorporating Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology into existing coal power plants and implementing a carbon tax could significantly reduce carbon emissions in all countries in the region. The paper suggests implementing carbon tax policy to reduce carbon emissions, retrofitting CCS technology in coal-based electricity powerplants, and developing renewable electricity at the same time as controlling emissions from non-renewable energy.

Social inclusion and the circular economy: The case of a fashion textiles manufacturer in Vietnam,"There has been significant growth in interest in the circular economy (""CE"") concept as a transformative solution to the prevailing linear economy, helping to solve various economic, environmental and social challenges. Nevertheless, pertinent issues such as societal inclusion, well-being and equity remain peripheral in the contemporary CE debate. Fulfilling human needs has been recognised as a prerequisite for sustainable development and was implicitly and explicitly prevalent in parts of the seminal material on which the CE is based. However, the contemporary use of the concept by business has left it bereft of any convincing evidence that a CE will satisfy needs in a radically different way to the existing linear economy. As a result, there are few practical cases for business learning, and even fewer in a developing world context. This study explores a unique business venture implemented by a Vietnam-based denim manufacturer, which simultaneously tackles two key development challenges: The inclusion of vulnerable communities and sustainable resource use. The venture employs persons with disabilities and utilises textile by-products from the core production to produce a range of upcycled items (e.g., bags, cushion covers etc). This forms part of a broader company-wide social sustainability and CE strategy.

SOCIAL ECONOMY AND THE TRANSITION TOWARDS CIRCULAR ECONOMY: A SURVEY BASED APPROACH,"Introduction. . European social economy employment is 6.3% of the European Union's (EU) working population. In Romania and other recent EU member states, it is responsible for less than 2% of the total employment. The need for a precise legal and political concept of social economy and social enterprise confused the Romanian population and made their measurement easier. Both concepts have been increasingly employed in Romania since 2005, following the new EU policy approaches for social inclusion. Consequently, the social economy has grown significantly in recent years, with a diverse range of actors pursuing various social goals. Aim and tasks. . The paper aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the social economy in Romania by showing the activity types and their involvement in the circular economy transition and then by examining the social enterprises' social and economic performance. Results. . The creation of social value and social impact of social enterprises, the response of organisations to entrepreneurial change, and the level of risk-taking were substantiated. The way these aspects are correlated with performance was determined. A quantitative analysis of the social economy and transition towards a circular economy in Romania yielded the following main findings: i) more than half of the surveyed enterprises did not understand the concept of a circular economy, and ii) there was a strong statistically significant correlation (R=0.61) between social performance and environmental receptivity. The correlation between social and economic performance is statistically significant, with an average intensity (R=0.32). The correlation between economic performance and responsiveness to the environment was also statistically significant for medium-to-high intensity (R= 0.28). Conclusions. . The social economy puts social and democratic objectives into practice, whereas a circular economy is essential for a sustainable transition. Various actors operate in different industries and geographic areas in the Romanian social economy. Social economy actors aim to contribute to a more inclusive economy and equitable society, inspiring the government and private sector to demonstrate and implement more inclusive and sustainable practices. These practices cover decent labour, more education, and secure lives.

Social Aspects of Electric Vehicles Research-Trends and Relations to Sustainable Development Goals,"E-mobility sustainability assessment is becoming more comprehensive with research integrating social aspects without focusing only on technical, economic, and/or environmental perspectives. The transportation sector is indeed one of the leading and most challenging greenhouse gas polluters, and e-mobility is seen as one of the potential solutions; however, a social perspective must be further investigated to improve the perception of and acceptance of electric vehicles. This could consequently lead to the European Green Deal's holy grail: faster decarbonization of the transportation sector. Another way to achieve it is by promoting more comprehensive sustainable development goals. Therefore, this paper combines a systematic review of recent research with research emphasis focused on social aspects of electric vehicles and their interconnection with specific UN Sustainable Development Goals. By knowing the current research focus mainly related with ""perception"" of electric vehicles and assessing their social ""impact"" as well as an emerging area of ""user experience"" and their relations with UN Sustainable Development Goals enables better insight on the current and future directions of electric vehicle social sustainability research. The current priority is identified as ""climate actions"".

Social and institutional factors associated with land use and forest conservation along two urban gradients in Massachusetts,"With the rate of suburban development now surpassing the amount of land protected nationally for conservation, the act of preserving land from development becomes a crucial need to support critical ecosystem services and human quality of life. While previous studies have quantified the loss of forest lands and open spaces along urban gradients, rarely have they quantified the connections between land use policies, actions and land use change. We examined social and institutional factors positively influencing land conservation efforts across two urban gradients in Massachusetts, one surrounding the large, economically growing city of Boston and the other surrounding the smaller, economically depressed city of Springfield. Despite their differences, the metropolitan areas of these two cities are both growing rapidly. We measured forest and open space protection for a sample of 15 towns, comparing this with quantitative assessments of town-level open space policies, investment in conservation planning, wealth, and social capital, in the form of local land trusts. We found significant differences between the two urban gradients, with greater land protection occurring in the Boston area towns. The towns with the largest proportion of protected land were at the urban end of both gradients. We found that land trusts played a significant role in the conservation of open spaces, and wealthier towns were more likely to have long-standing, active land trusts. This result suggests that fostering land trusts in lower-income communities could have a lasting positive impact on land conservation in the face of rapid suburbanization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Assessing Sustainability Impacts and Paradoxes of Large-Scale Solar Farms in Energy Infrastructure Project,"This study aims to determine the sustainability impact of large-scale solar PV farms and to recommend strategies for their sustainable development. Using a comprehensive assessment framework, we analyzed environmental, economic, and social dimensions through a combination of life cycle assessment (LCA), cost-benefit analysis, and respondent interviews. Our findings reveal that while solar farms significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, they also pose challenges such as land use conflicts, ecological disruption, and social equity issues. Specifically, the displacement of agricultural land and impacts on local biodiversity emerged as critical concerns. Additionally, although solar farms create jobs and reduce energy costs, these benefits are sometimes offset by high initial investment costs and long-term maintenance. The study underscores the importance of integrated planning and policy-making to address these challenges and enhance the sustainability of solar energy projects. These insights contribute to the broader discourse on balancing renewable energy development with sustainable land and community management practices.",Not About Sufficiency
Computed tomography of the brain in acute carbon monoxide poisoning,"Of 107 patients admitted to the South Western Hyperbaric Medical Centre with acute carbon monoxide poisoning for hyperbaric oxygen therapy 19 had cerebral imaging performed: 17 patients had CT, one patient had MRI and CT and one patient MRI alone. The role of brain CT is established in determining the prognosis from acute carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain imaging was indicated because of unconsciousness on admission and failure or delayed improvement in neurological status after initiation of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Of the 18 patients who underwent brain CT, seven were found to have the characteristic changes of bilateral low attenuation areas within the globus pallidus and six had low attenuation changes within cerebral white matter. In two patients there were both globus pallidus and cerebral white matter changes. Out of the total of the 19 patients who were studied, four patients died, 10 recovered fully and five had variable disabilities ranging from short term memory loss to more severe cognitive impairment and physical disability. The role of CT and the practicalities of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for acute carbon monoxide poisoning are discussed in the light of the experience from a regional dedicated medical diving centre. © 1996 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Not About Sufficiency
"Lymph, lymph glands, and homeostasis","Under aerobic conditions every respiring cell in the human body normally consumes oxygen to burn food and produce stoichiometric quantities of water which dissolves carbon dioxide and less soluble cell products. The effluent water and solutes appear in the form of lymph in the interstices between cells. The lymph effluent from all respiring cells flows to become the circulating lymph and blood plasma which coordinately sustain a steady state of homeostasis throughout the internal milieu. As a result, every living cell served by the vascular system has equal opportunity to partake of water and solutes emanating from or absorbed by remaining cells. Solute quantities available depend on cell location, regional plasma flow, local vascular permeability, molecular size, configuration, solubility and concentration, as well as avid cell receptors. Proportional to oxygen consumption, organized lymph glands develop in environments of relatively high oxygen tension around regional arteries to filter and process lymph coming from regional cells, and to produce effluent lymph rich in soluble globulins extruded by local mononuclear cells (especially macrophages, plasmacytes, lymphocytes), along with suspended small cytoplasm-poor lymphocytes. In turn, such dissolved globulins and remarkably motile small lymphocytes help feed, regulate growth and provide immunity to remaining cells. The lymph effluent from lymph glands and residua from capillary filtrates, along with newly absorbed solvent water, join the blood circulation during pulmonary inspiration in volumes proportional to the volume of air inspired with each breath.",Not About Sufficiency
GIS-based measures of environmental equity: Exploring their sensitivity and significance,"In order to determine whether principles of environmental justice have been violated, a large number of empirical studies have been carded out to ascertain whether minority and low-income populations are disproportionately exposed to industrial pollution. This study provides a comparative evaluation of two commonly employed proximity measures in GIS-based environmental equity assessment, examining their influence on the results of the analysis, and proposes a methodology for evaluating the significance of these results. 1990 census data on population characteristics and data from the 1995 EPA's toxic release inventory (TRI) for the City of Minneapolis, MN are used. These results also allow a preliminary assessment of environmental equity/inequity in potential exposure to airborne toxic chemicals for racial minorities, poor people and children in Minneapolis.

Who’s fighting for justice?: advocacy in energy justice and just transition scholarship,"Recent political, economic and policy change in the US, Australia, and Europe, in particular, have put transitions towards low-carbon energy futures at the forefront of local and national policy agendas. How these transitions are managed is likely to affect the feasibility, timing and scope of transition policy. Recognizing the existing maldistribution of the benefits and burdens of fossil fuel-based extraction, energy generation, and distribution, advocates and scholars increasingly call for policies that not only support decarbonization goals, but also those of equity. Proposals that do not contain such goals may be met with resistance. This review examines the politics of achieving more just outcomes by asking, what is our current understanding of justice advocacy and the impacts of such advocacy on the energy transition? In this study, we systematically review articles that include the key concepts of ‘just transition’ or ‘energy justice’ and that examine advocacy in energy transition contexts. We find advocates from diverse communities and affiliated with varied organizational types are involved in advocacy. Diverse issues motivate advocates and the most common advocate type in the literature are residents that are affected by local impacts of energy transition decisions. Extra-institutional tactics are the most common means of advocate action. We also find that advocacy is often motivated by issues related to decision-making processes and environmental degradation. These findings illuminate that: (a) energy systems and transitions are governed by processes and institutions that are often inaccessible, (b) advocates often attempt to affect change using tactics external to such processes and institutions, and (c) issues of environmental degradation are often prominent in advocacy discourse concerning the energy transition. Future research should seek to more clearly determine advocates’ primary motivations and the tactics and actions that ultimately aid or hinder more equitable outcomes.",Not About Sufficiency
Circular economy and inclusion as effective tools to prevent ecological threats in rural areas during military operations,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the context of war, rural areas of Ukraine have encountered serious environmental challenges that threaten not only the environment but also the resilience of communities. The primary aim of this study is to investigate how the implementation of circular economy principles and inclusive strategies can mitigate the risks associated with ecological threats, tackle resource utilization challenges, and promote ecological restoration in rural regions affected by conflict. The main objectives encompass evaluating the effectiveness of circular economy approaches and inclusive policies in addressing the aforementioned issues. METHODS: Diverse approaches were employed to assess the effects of circular economy and inclusivity on the environmental conditions in rural regions. The study was founded upon an extensive examination of scientific literature and a thorough analysis of prior studies. This approach facilitated the evaluation of the potential consequences of these factors on the environment. Quantitative data analysis was employed as the primary approach, utilizing regression modeling to ascertain the correlation between the degree of inclusion and the adoption of circular economy practices. This analysis further facilitated the identification of any alterations in the level of ecological threat. Additionally, the use of taxonomy allowed determining the level of ecological threaten, while cluster analysis was used to distribute territories based on the level of ecological threaten ecocide. Factor analysis was utilized to gain insights into the impact of circular economy practices and inclusion on ecological risks, while regression analysis was employed to validate the research hypotheses. FINDINGS: The study demonstrates integrating circular economy principles with active community engagement significantly mitigates ecological threats in wartime rural Ukraine, achieving a 45 percent risk reduction. Direct positive impact of circular economy practices and inclusivity on environmental health, marking a 30 percent ecological improvement, was discovered. Innovations and inclusive practices have been found to significantly enhance biodiversity, resulting in a remarkable 25 percent increase. Additionally, these advancements have also been observed to boost agricultural productivity by an impressive 20 percent. These findings underline the urgent need for a shifttowards a sustainable management model combining circular economy principles with extensive social inclusion, essential for ecological resilience and rejuvenation of rural Ukrainian areas amidst conflict. CONCLUSION: Implementing circular economy and inclusivity in rural Ukraine reduces ecological threats by 45 percent, enhancing biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Circular economy and inclusion are key strategies for ensuring ecological resilience and restoration in rural areas of Ukraine during war time. The resilience and recovery of affected regions can be enhanced through the adoption of circular economy practices, waste reduction strategies, resource reuse initiatives, the advancement of low-carbon technologies, and active community participation in environmental endeavors.",Not About Sufficiency
Shared and environmentally just responsibility for global biodiversity loss,"Human land use is the main driver of terrestrial biodiversity loss. It has been argued that producers and consumers have a shared responsibility for biodiversity loss because this land use is directly and indirectly driven by the local and global demand for products. Such responsibility sharing would be an important step for global biodiversity cooperation and conservation. Here, we use a global multiregional input-output framework to estimate consumption-based biodiversity loss, integrating with both the physical Food and Agriculture Biomass Input-Output (FABIO) dataset and a global monetary input-output table (EXIOBASE). We use an environmental justice framework for assigning biodiversity loss responsibility between producers and consumers. In this framework, we employ the Human Development Index (HDI) as a proxy of the weighting parameter for both producers and consumers. An environmental justice perspective may provide a fairer distribution of responsibility in a world where different nations have very different capabilities and see varying benefits from international trade. Environmentally just accounting increases the footprint of the Global North compared to other common approaches for sharing responsibility across all producers and consumers along international supply chains. We describe how environmental justice may inform cooperation in biodiversity protection between stakeholders along global supply chains.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying Social Justice in Energy Transition: A Policy-Driven Assessment Framework for China,"Addressing climate change and promoting social justice are crucial sustainable development goals. However, the quantitative assessment of how energy transition policies impact social justice remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we develop a novel Energy Transition Social Justice Framework (ETSJF) that integrates four dimensions (energy supply, energy demand, procedural justice, and distributive justice) and three perspectives (individual, group-organizational, and society). The ETSJF index is constructed to measure the progress of social justice in China’s energy transition from 2010 to 2021. The index exhibits a robust growth trend, increasing from 269 in 2010 to 965 in 2021, with an average annual growth rate of 12.9%. The years 2014 and 2020–2021 mark turning points, coinciding with the implementation of transformative policy initiatives and China’s carbon neutrality pledge. Employing multi-source data analysis, we evaluate the impact of energy transition policies on social justice using the Energy Transition Policy Impact Intensity (ETPII). Our analysis reveals that energy transition policies significantly positively impact overall social justice (ETPII: 1.133), with variations across dimensions. Energy supply shows the most potent effects (ETPII: 1.203), while procedural justice exhibits the weakest impact (ETPII: 0.804). These findings offer policy implications for achieving a just and inclusive energy transition. The proposed ETSJF and ETPII enable the systematic monitoring of social justice progress and offer methodological tools for policymakers to optimize energy transition policies through data-driven decision-making.",Not About Sufficiency
"Solid waste characteristics and management strategies at ST Theresa (STT) and Holy Cross (HC) hospitals in Chirumanzu rural District, Zimbabwe","Management of solid waste from rural hospitals is among major problems affecting developing countries. This is mostly attributed to inadequate data related to quantity and quality of hospital solid waste. Similarly, information related to rural hospital solid waste characteristics and management is limited in Zimbabwe. However, SDGs complemented by Zimbabwe Vision 2030, NDS 1 advocates for sustainable solid waste management. Hence, enough data related to characteristics of solid waste from rural hospitals are required to attain sustainability. This research focuses on hospital solid waste characteristics and management strategies at STT and HC rural hospitals. Descriptive cross sectional research design which triangulates qualitative and quantitative paradigms was utilized. Interviews, observations, questionnaires were used to collect data. Quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences whereas qualitative data were subjected to content analysis. Solid waste generated at STT encompasses non-hazardous (77.35%), hazardous waste (22.65%). At HC solid waste consists of non-hazardous (79%) and hazardous waste (21%). Respondents at STT (70.4%) and HC (72.7%) noted that solid waste was increasing. Solid waste was increasing due to various factors namely high use of disposable materials at HC (35.1%), STT (42.5%) and increase of patients at HC (30%) and STT (29.7%). Solid waste was indiscriminately stored in various types of containers although pedal operated bins and sharp containers were highly used at STT (72.4%) and HC (69.1%). Waste receptacles were transported to disposal sites using wheelbarrows and manual handling. Open pits and burning were among disposal strategies but incineration was regarded as the golden approach at STT (44.8%) and HC (41.8%). Inappropriate hospital solid waste management was due to shortage of finance at STT (38.1%) and HC (30.9%) and unawareness among health workers. Although it was worsened by lack of all stakeholder participation at STT (79.0%) and HC (76.4%). Consequently, the study recommended application of strategies which support circular economy, integrated approach, raising awareness of health workers and provision of enough resources to rural hospitals.",Not About Sufficiency

How the circular economy can revive the Sustainable Development Goals,"With progress on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) badly off track, international policymakers are scrambling for solutions that can both revitalize the current SDG agenda and drive more effective action on humanity’s big challenges in the future. The ‘circular economy’ offers clear potential in this area. This wide-ranging concept, which involves making economies less wasteful and less resource-intensive while contributing to human development and well-being, could hold the key to accelerating SDG delivery. A more formal role within the SDGs and any emerging post-2030 successor regime would also provide a catalyst for expansion of the circular economy itself. This paper explores how the circular economy could support each of the 17 SDGs, and argues for the concept to be put at the heart of emerging plans to drive sustainable development towards 2050. Doing so could help to foster resilient economies, reduce environmental impacts and ensure equitable resource distribution. The paper identifies five priorities for action: embedding principles of justice and inclusivity into the circular transition; increasing international policy coordination; reforming the financial architecture to ensure the circular economy gets the investment it needs; rewiring the global system of trade to make it easier to trade circular products and services; and developing common standards and metrics.",Not About Sufficiency

"Harry Stobbs Memorial Lecture, 1997 Rethinking high input systems of livestock production: A case study of nitrogen emissions in Dutch dairy farming","Livestock are essential in many farming systems where they provide income, food and power, or where they enhance soil fertility or the socioeconomic situation of farmers. However, livestock can also cause environmental degradation, pollution and social inequality. The contradiction between these views lies in differences between production systems, here called modes of agriculture. This paper starts, therefore, by giving a classification of livestock systems as a framework to rethink the role of livestock in high-input agriculture. The classification explains what is meant by high-input systems by placing them in a sequence of modes in agriculture that each face sustainability problems in different ways. Secondly, the paper discusses negative effects of livestock in high-input systems by zooming in on nitrogen surpluses in dairy farming of the Netherlands. It then elaborates ways to cope with these problems by distinguishing between linear and dynamic aspects. Linear aspects refer to reductionist approaches like other methods of feeding, housing and/or manure application. Dynamic aspects refer to holistic approaches which acknowledge that an intervention in one part of the system affects the functioning of the system elsewhere. Examples of practical and administrative measures regarding the rethinking of high-input systems are elaborated.",Not About Sufficiency

Scalar Containment of Energy Justice and Its Democratic Discontents: Solar Power and Energy Poverty Alleviation,"The threats climate change poses require rapid and wide decarbonization efforts in the energy sector. Historically, large-scale energy operations, often instrumental for a scaled and effective approach to meet decarbonization goals, undergird energy-related injustices. Energy poverty is a multi-dimensional form of injustice, with relevance to low-carbon energy transitions. Defined as the condition of being unable to access an adequate level of household energy services, energy poverty persists despite the emergence of affordable renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaics (PV). Historical injustices and the modularity of solar PV combine to offer new possibilities in ownership, production and distribution of cost-competitive, clean and collectively scalable energy. Consequently, emerging policy priorities for positive energy districts call into question the traditional large-scale modality of energy operations. We report from a case study of solar power in Lisbon, a frontrunner in urban energy transitions while also home to high energy poverty incidence. The study focuses on scalar aspects of justice in energy transitions to investigate whether and how solar PV can alleviate urban energy poverty. It features 2 months of fieldwork centered on community and expert perspectives, including semi-structured interviews and field observations. We mobilize a spatial energy justice framework to identify justice aspects of multi-scalar solar PV uptake. By showing how energy justice is shaped in diverse ways at different scales, we demonstrate ways in which scale matters for just urban energy transitions. We argue that small- and medium-scaled approaches to electricity distribution, an integral component of positive energy districts, can address specific justice concerns. However, even as such approaches gain attention and legitimacy, they risk structurally excluding socio-economically vulnerable users, and proceed slowly relative to large-scale solar rollout.",Not About Sufficiency

Economy and schemes of recurrence: Sustainability as an economic and ethical value,"Sustainability has become an important catch-word in several fields that has stimulated an important body of work on a wide variety of topics ranging from economic development and agricultural production to social equity and biodiversity. Few generalizations can be made about such a diverse body of work. However, one can say with some confidence that this reflection has come about in large part from a sense that certain activities constitute a threat to human well-being through the destruction of the necessary conditions of human survival. This fact has contributed to a rampant pessimism regarding prospects for the future and a rethinking of the meaning of sustainability in the fields noted above. However, acknowledging that sustainability is a rich concept in current thinking about economy, environment, and ecology does not mean that it is clearly understood. Indeed, the opposite is true. For example, John Pezzey, in a recent World Bank study, identified twenty-seven definitions of sustainability. Even a summary survey of the work about sustainability shows that the term is a multidimensional concept that comprises of a number of interrelated elements, including ecological, environmental, economic, technological, social, cultural, ethical, and political dimensions. © 1996, MCB UP Limited",Not About Sufficiency
Socioeconomic Impacts of Climate Mitigation Actions in Greece: Quantitative Assessment and Public Perception,"Appropriately designed and implemented climate mitigation actions have multiple co-benefits (yet some trade-offs cannot be excluded) that result in substantial social and economic value beyond their direct impact on reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions. Despite their wider acknowledgement by the research community, decision makers and the public have incomplete information on these multiple effects. This paper has a twofold objective: First, through analytical bottom-up approaches, it assesses, in quantitative terms, the macroeconomic effects and the public health benefits attributed to a variety of mitigation actions under consideration in the context of the Greek Energy and Climate Plan. Second, it investigates, through a social survey, how citizens perceive climate change and value these multiple impacts of mitigation actions, and to what extent they are willing to pay for them and support the adoption of policy measures aiming at the green transition of the Greek economy. We show that mitigation actions bring about significant health benefits, particularly in cities, and generate significant positive macroeconomic effects, particularly if mitigation actions focus on the decarbonization of the building sector and on the exploitation of local renewable sources. We also argue that most people do not realize that climate mitigation actions can have wider benefits for society, such as tackling energy poverty, improving public health, and creating new jobs. Unwillingness to pay tends to be the prominent attitude. People who are more reluctant to cover a part of the cost of environmental protection are less likely to perceive that climate change is one of the main challenges at global and national level and support the adoption of climate mitigation policies. In this context, the national strategy for climate change should focus on effectively informing and engaging the public in climate mitigation strategies, strengthening the public trust in government institutions, promoting mutually acceptable solutions with the local communities, and providing incentives for changing citizens’ behavior towards climate-related actions.",Not About Sufficiency
Safe and just operating spaces for regional social-ecological systems,"Humanity faces a major global challenge in achieving wellbeing for all, while simultaneously ensuring that the biophysical processes and ecosystem services that underpin wellbeing are exploited within scientifically informed boundaries of sustainability. We propose a framework for defining the safe and just operating space for humanity that integrates social wellbeing into the original planetary boundaries concept (Rockstrom et al., 2009a,b) for application at regional scales. We argue that such a framework can: (1) increase the policy impact of the boundaries concept as most governance takes place at the regional rather than planetary scale; (2) contribute to the understanding and dissemination of complexity thinking throughout governance and policy-making; (3) act as a powerful metaphor and communication tool for regional equity and sustainability. We demonstrate the approach in two rural Chinese localities where we define the safe and just operating space that lies between an environmental ceiling and a social foundation from analysis of time series drawn from monitored and palaeoecological data, and from social survey statistics respectively. Agricultural intensification has led to poverty reduction, though not eradicated it, but at the expense of environmental degradation. Currently, the environmental ceiling is exceeded for degraded water quality at both localities even though the least well-met social standards are for available piped water and sanitation. The conjunction of these social needs and environmental constraints around the issue of water access and quality illustrates the broader value of the safe and just operating space approach for sustainable development.

Role of water-energy-food nexus in environmental management and climate action,"The demand for water, energy, and food resources increased in tandem with the world's population, industrialization, and urbanization. Anthropogenic sources of environmental pollutants degrade the water resources while population expansion contributes to rising demand for non-renewable energy resources which further enhances the greenhouse gas emissions. Also, maintaining the food security/-safety is another challenge which needs to be addressed for securing 'planetary public health'. The sustainability programs, pragmatic studies, and strategies from regulatory/scientific institutions attempt to reduce the depletion of these resources and mitigate environmental challenges however, the individualistic approaches proves to be inadequate. Therefore, the present review emphasizes the use of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus as a tool to combat environmental degradation, address climate action, and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we investigate methodological paradigm and application of WEF Nexus in an inter-related framework through case studies on water resources, energy efficiency, urban food production, food waste reduction, cross-sectoral perspectives, and the circular economy. It has been widely observed that excessive exploitation of these resources influences the global food supply and demand, water availability, resilience in energy and socio-economic sector. Also, such perturbations in water, energy, and food sectors were found to be inextricably linked with climate change. The results further revealed that WEF nexus approach stimulates multilevel and inter-sectoral governance, thereby aiding to address the complexities and inefficiencies in achieving the SDGs. The prioritization of WEF Nexus strategy, especially under the event of COVID-19 can be a holistic approach to sustainably utilise natural resources to help achieve the environmental sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Population and relevant issues of the present social agenda,"Various mechanisms implicated in the interaction between population and the environment involve different demographic variables (population size, growth, and spatial distribution). Three factors were analyzed as they correlate to population: the environment, education, and decentralization. Mechanisms of interaction were identified and debated. One mechanism is related to the magnitude of population and the other is related to the rhythm of demographic increase. The geographic concentration of the population, as well as production and consumption, are other factors exerting a demographic influence on the environment. Migration also constitutes a relevant population-environment interaction mechanism both in urban and rural areas. The directions of policies on population, development, and the environment were also specified. Focus was centered on the market, fixed resources, inequality and dependence, and population as an intermediate variable. Population, development, and the environment were examined with methodological instruments and their use for policies: the impact of population, affluence, and technology (carrying capacity, environmental impact assessments). The basic interrelations of population and education relate to the impact of population trends on the demand for education, consequences of demographic trends on the educational conditions of the population (fertility and the composition of households), and the effects of changes in education on population variables. Instruments for the operative integration of population variables into educational policies and programs comprise: estimation methods and projection models of educational requirements; education as the inducer of sociodemographic behavior; the calibration of the impact of internal and international migration; and the role of local government. Aspects of population, decentralization, and public administration involve: decentralization and spatial distribution of the population; sociodemographic policies and decentralization; population, equity, and decentralization; population, decentralization, and the environment; and population, decentralization, and transformation of production.",Not About Sufficiency

Studying the trade-off between these two aspects helps ensure that current needs are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The present study aims to understand whether there is a trade-off between the Ecological Footprint (EF) and the Human Development Index (HDI), using data from 42 European countries from 2006 to 2018. Other variables were also employed (Financial Development Index, Globalization Index, Human Freedom Index, Urban Population, Biocapacity, Renewable Energy) in two main models, through several econometric tests (Interactive Fixed Effects, Common Correlated Effect Mean Group). Other models were estimated for robustness checks. It is concluded that there is a trade-off between the EF and the HDI. This leads to problems when trying to achieve human well-being and environmental sustainability simultaneously. This study is innovative as the relationship between human development and environmental degradation has not been analyzed using these two variables for European countries.

By understanding why individuals, households, nations and regions are vulnerable, and how they have buffered themselves against climatic and environmental fluctuations, present and future vulnerability can be redressed. Through case studies from around the globe, the authors explore past experiences with climate variability, as well as the likely effects of, and the possible policy responses to, the types of climatic events that global warming might bring. -Editors",Not About Sufficiency
CO2 emissions from passenger transport in Rio de Janeiro,"Transport externalities have generally been discussed at the local level perspective.

The study employed the pool mean group autoregressive distributive lag (PMG-ARDL), fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) techniques for the analysis. In the long-run, non-renewable energy and economic growth have a positive impact, whereas renewable energy and remittances have a negative impact on CO2 and ecological footprint. The impact of non-renewable energy on CO2 and ecological footprint is more significant than renewable energy in both the short- and long-run. Most of the variables have a bidirectional causality among each other. This highlights the need for a paradigm shift towards renewable energy in the top recipients specifically for developing countries.",Not About Sufficiency

Resource Recovery from Waste: Restoring the Balance between Resource Scarcity and Waste Overload,"Current societal patterns of production and consumption drive a twin environmental crisis of resource scarcity and waste overload. Positioning waste and resource management in the context of ecosystem stewardship, this article relates increasing resource demand and waste production to the violation of planetary boundaries and human rights. We argue that a transition towards a circular economy (CE) that contributes to a resilient environment and human well-being is necessary to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The transition requires scientific and technological progress, including the development of low-energy biogeochemical technologies for resource recovery, and multi-dimensional value assessment tools integrating environmental, social, and economic factors. While the urgency to adopt a CE is well-recognised, progress has been slow. Coordinated change is required from multiple actors across society. Academia can contribute through participatory action research. This article concludes with the participation strategy of the Resource Recovery from Waste programme, aiming for changes in mentality, industry practices, and policies and regulations in the waste and resource management landscape in the UK.",Not About Sufficiency
Resilience of and through urban ecosystem services,"Cities and urban areas are critical components of global sustainability as loci of sustainability progress and drivers of global transformation, especially in terms of energy efficiency, climate change adaptation, and social innovation. However, urban ecosystems have not been incorporated adequately into urban governance and planning for resilience despite mounting evidence that urban resident health and wellbeing is closely tied to the quality, quantity, and diversity of urban ecosystem services. We suggest that urban ecosystem services provide key links for bridging planning, management and governance practices seeking transitions to more sustainable cities, and serve an important role in building resilience in urban systems. Emerging city goals for resilience should explicitly incorporate the value of urban ES in city planning and governance. We argue that cities need to prioritize safeguarding of a resilient supply of ecosystem services to ensure livable, sustainable cities, especially given the dynamic nature of urban systems continually responding to global environmental change. Building urban resilience of and through ecosystem services, both in research and in practice, will require dealing with the dynamic nature of urban social-ecological systems and incorporating multiple ways of knowing into governance approaches to resilience including from scientists, practitioners, designers and planners.

Research on multi-stage strategy of low carbon building material's production by small and medium-sized manufacturers: A three-party evolutionary game analysis,"Using green technology by building materials manufacturers to produce low-carbon building materials is an effective way to control carbon emissions and promote traditional industries' green and low-carbon development. Based on the government, small and medium-sized building materials manufacturers, and scientific research institutes, this paper sets 15 variables that affect the strategy selection of game participants, establishes an evolutionary game model under the constraint of the carbon tax, explores the behavioral strategies of the three parties in the industry life cycle to produce low-carbon building materials, and analyzes the sensitivity of critical factors. Results: The government plays a leading role in the initial stage, which is gradually replaced by the market-leading mechanism as the low-carbon building materials industry develops to maturity. The government's decision-making behavior is almost unaffected by the two, and appropriate subsidies and carbon tax penalties at each stage of the industry life cycle can help improve the enthusiasm of the other two parties to participate in low-carbon behavior. Establishing a reasonable income distribution coefficient between small and medium-sized building materials manufacturers and scientific research institutes is more conducive to speeding up the stable state than transferring and selling technology.",Not About Sufficiency
Repair for a Broken Economy: Lessons for Circular Economy from an International Interview Study of Repairers,"The idea of replacing the broken linear economy with circular forms to help address the current sustainability crisis is gaining world-wide traction in policy, industry, and academia. This article presents results from an international interview study with 34 repair practitioners and experts in different fields. The article aims to improve understandings of the potential of repair so as to contribute to a more just, sustainable, and circular economy. Through a five-step qualitative method the results reveal and explore three tensions inherent in repair: first, repair activities constitute different forms of subjectivity; second, repair entails different and sometimes contested temporalities; and finally, even though repair is deeply political in practice, the politics of repair are not always explicit, and some repair activities are actively depoliticized. The opportunities and obstacles embodied in these tensions are generative in repair practices and debates, but poorly reflected in contemporary circular economy discourse. We conclude that a richer, more inclusive, and politicized understanding of repair can support environmental justice in the implementation of circular economy (CE) and provide greater opportunities for just and transformational sustainability strategies and policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Renewables but unjust? Critical restoration geography as a framework for addressing global renewable energy injustice,"A global transition toward a sustainable energy system, incorporating for example Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs), is essential for decarbonizing electricity production, meeting energy demands, and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, the growing scale of renewable energy development has exacerbated local environmental and social challenges; improper assessment of RETs has led to recorded conflicts and resource injustice in transitioning communities. The purpose of this study is to analyze global cases of renewable energy development resulting in conflict and environmental injustice, and to propose Critical Restoration Geography (CRG) as a framework strategizing for pre-emptive avoidance of RET-related injustices. Evidence of global environmental injustice in RET development was explored using recorded conflicts from the Global Atlas of Environmental Justice (EJAtlas). We synthesized global variations in affected demographics, land area and conflict resolution with respect to achievement of environmental justice by RET type (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal). Based on analysis of GEJA's 102 recorded cases of RET-related environmental (in)justice from 2001 to 2021, justice was either not achieved or ambiguous in 55 and 20 cases. Drivers for these injustices include displacement of Indigenous communities, exclusion of communities from decision making processes, and protection of business interests over biodiversity and community needs. The proposed CRG framework details seven principles for avoiding environmental injustice in global RET development; including recognition and deconstruction of power dynamics, incorporation of multiple knowledge systems, and promotion of social justice. These principles serve to inform environmentally just approaches to policymaking for future RET development in any geographical context.",Not About Sufficiency
Renewable energy transition and regional integration: Energizing the pathway to sustainable development,"This study examines the influence of renewable energy transition on sustainable development, with multidimensional regional integration as a moderator. Using various regression techniques, a balanced panel dataset was analyzed for 64 countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and three sub-regions (Asia, Europe, and Middle East-Africa) from 2005 to 2020. The findings reveal a positive relationship between renewable energy transition and sustainable development across the full panel and sub-regions of the BRI. Multidimensional regional integration also positively influences sustainable development. The interaction of regional integration with renewable energy transitions positively moderates sustainable development in Asia and Europe but negatively in the Middle East-African economies. Macroeconomic conditions, institutional quality, and population size positively affect sustainable development for the full panel, with mixed effects in sub-regions. Conversely, government consumption negatively impacts sustainable development for both the full and regional panels of the BRI. This study underscores important policy implications for promoting a balanced transition from conventional energy sources to renewables, thereby fostering green economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion.",Not About Sufficiency
Renewable energy proliferation for sustainable development: Role of cross-border electricity trade,"Electricity production is intrinsically linked to economic development. Energy is a necessity but fossil fuel-based energy sources, which are still globally predominant, are detrimental to the environment. Renewable energy offers a better alternative, but there are multiple barriers to its proliferation. Intermittency and reliability issues are a couple of major barriers to the growth of renewable energy. One strategy promoting renewable energy growth is to enhance cross-border electricity trade (CBET). In addition to addressing intermittency and reliability issues, CBET offers a larger market for the renewable energy. The paper tests these hypotheses and finds considerable empirical support for the same. A clear causal linkage has been found from CBET to renewable energy generation. We have applied nonparametric regression to establish the association between CBET and renewable energy generation. The method is less restrictive in the sense that no a priori functional form is assumed for the sought relationship. Having established the affirmative role of CBET in boosting renewable energy generation, we advocate for concerted policy intervention by trading partners to overcome the barriers promoting CBET. This should help in achieving sustainable development goal of affordable and sustainable energy for all.",Not About Sufficiency
"Renewable energy market in Africa: Opportunities, progress, challenges, and future prospects","The transition to renewable energy is crucial for addressing Africa's rising energy demand while fostering sustainable development. With abundant renewable resources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and biomass, Africa is uniquely positioned to play a key role in the global low carbon energy transition. This study investigates the role of renewable energy in supporting Africa's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and its alignment with the Paris Agreement's climate goals. Using a combination of empirical methodologies, including market analysis and cost-benefit evaluations, we assess the potential of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate energy poverty, and promote economic growth. Our findings show that harnessing just 25 % of Africa's renewable energy potential could significantly reduce energy poverty, contributing to a sustainable, low-carbon future. Furthermore, we highlights the declining costs of renewable energy technologies, driven by innovation, economies of scale, and market dynamics, making renewable energy increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources. This has led to lower consumer energy prices, improved market attractiveness, and enhanced profitability for renewable energy investments. By examining the socio-economic impacts of renewable energy adoption, the study provides key insights into the market dynamics, investment potential, and policy implications for accelerating Africa's renewable energy transition. Our findings suggest that targeted investments in renewable energy could drive a just transition, improve energy access, and foster long-term socio-economic development across the continent.",Not About Sufficiency

Fundamental aspects of social sustainability and well-being-a healthy, educated population, equality, good governance, and reasonable income distribution-are related to higher levels of logistics performance. In addition, while logistics performance is a driver of economic activity and success, it is also a contributor to environmental degradation in the form of harmful emissions.

"Relationship Study on Land Use Spatial Distribution Structure and Energy-Related Carbon Emission Intensity in Different Land Use Types of Guangdong, China, 1996-2008","This study attempts to discuss the relationship between land use spatial distribution structure and energy-related carbon emission intensity in Guangdong during 1996-2008. We quantized the spatial distribution structure of five land use types including agricultural land, industrial land, residential and commercial land, traffic land, and other land through applying spatial Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient. Then the corresponding energy-related carbon emissions in each type of land were calculated in the study period. Through building the reasonable regression models, we found that the concentration degree of industrial land is negatively correlated with carbon emission intensity in the long term, whereas the concentration degree is positively correlated with carbon emission intensity in agricultural land, residential and commercial land, traffic land, and other land. The results also indicate that land use spatial distribution structure affects carbon emission intensity more intensively than energy efficiency and production efficiency do. These conclusions provide valuable reference to develop comprehensive policies for energy conservation and carbon emission reduction in a new perspective.",Not About Sufficiency
Re-imagining the driver-pressure-state-impact-response framework from an equity and inclusive development perspective,"The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework has been used by environmental agencies and others to assess environmental challenges and policy responses. However, in doing so, social justice or equity issues tend to come as an afterthought, while there is evidence that environmental challenges and policy responses are not equity (including gender-) neutral. Hence, this paper addresses the question: why should, and how can, equity issues and environmental justice be incorporated into the DPSIR framework? It presents a structure for including equity within DPSIR and applies it. It reviews the literature to bring together data that demonstrates that there is a clear equity perspective along the entire DPSIR analysis. It concludes that although individual environmental policies may succeed to achieve their specific goal in the short term; if they ignore the equity aspects, the policy strategies as a whole are likely to be environmentally unjust, and lead to exclusive and unsustainable development, which, in turn, could further exacerbate environmental challenges. This highlights the need for an integrated approach in efforts to achieve environmentally sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency

Regional green total factor performance analysis of China's construction industry based on a unified framework combining static and dynamic indexes,"It has an important meaning to improve green total factor performance in the construction industry for China's green and high-quality development. In addition to the traditional desirable economic output and undesirable CO2 emission output, the indicators representing social welfare of China's construction industry were incorporated into the total factor framework. On this basis, a global non-radial DEA approach was employed to explore the sources and the key factors leading to changes in regional green total factor performance of China's construction industry from both static and dynamic perspectives. The results were concluded as follows: (1) The lower energy efficiency and CO2 emission efficiency were the main reasons for low level of green total factor efficiency. During the sample period, energy efficiency increased rapidly while capital efficiency remained almost unchanged. (2) The green total factor productivity demonstrated an increasing trend, which was driven by technological progress rather than technical efficiency. An in-depth decomposition revealed that the deterioration of technical efficiency was mainly caused by the negative effect of CO2 emissions. (3) Regional green total factor performance of China's construction industry demonstrated obvious spatial heterogeneity. Each province should comprehensively consider its own characteristics of green development in the construction industry to formulate the corresponding optimization strategy. These findings can help decision makers design specific policies on regional-oriented green development of China's construction industry.",Not About Sufficiency
Refocusing ecosystem services towards sustainability,"Ecosystem services and sustainability have become prominent concepts in international policy and research agendas. However, a common conceptual ground between these concepts is currently underdeveloped. In particular, a vision is missing on how to align ecosystem services with overarching sustainability goals. Originally, the ecosystem service concept focused on sustaining human well-being through biodiversity conservation. Nevertheless, studies within the field also consider appropriation beyond carrying capacities, and natural resource management that involves environmentally damaging inputs as ecosystem service provision. This brings the ecosystem service concept into conflict with the core goal of sustainability, i.e. achieving justice within ecological limits over the long term. Here, we link the ecosystem service concept to sustainability outcomes operationalized in terms of justice. Our framing positions sustainability as an overarching goal which can be achieved through seven key strategies: equitable (1) intergenerational and (2) intragenerational distribution, (3) interspecies distribution, (4) fair procedures, recognition and participation, (5) sufficiency, (6) efficiency, and (7) persistence. Applying these strategies has the potential to re-focus the ecosystem service concept towards the normative goal of sustainability. We identify research needs for each strategy and further discuss questions regarding operationalization of the strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency

Recycling Waste Plastic: An Implementation of the Circular Economy Principles or Just Pollution Shift,"As the demand for plastics increases, the international plastic waste trade has grown steeply during the last decades. Different studies have identified that plastic waste frequently travels from developed to developing/underdeveloped countries posing environmental burdens on them turning the issue into an environmental justice debate denoting the unequal distribution of social and environmental costs. With the recent implementation of China's waste import bans, different countries such as Turkey have become importers of large amounts of waste. From a Circular Economy (CE) perspective, this trade could be classified as an implementation of 9R principles, particularly in plastic recycling. However, the rapid change in waste flows in Turkey and the lack of waste management infrastructures have generated several problems in the economic, environmental, and social spheres of sustainability. Against this background, this paper analyses the plastic waste trade by employing a combined SWOT/ANP method to highlight the most important factors to reach an environmentally just recycling practice in line with the CE principles. After determining the main factors of the problem, a set of possible strategies were identified and evaluated. Preliminary findings indicate that mainstream practices i.e. recycling and reuse, are frequently classified as insufficient to reach a CE model that embraces an environmental justice perspective. Unless these approaches consider the matter holistically, material recovery ends up in shifting pollution to other countries, promoting a circular washing cycle and preventing the achievement of real sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Recycling scheme of carbon pricing for inclusive decarbonization and energy transition: A recursive computable general equilibrium analysis in China,"Revenue recycling is crucial for carbon pricing to achieve inclusive decarbonization and energy transition. Several studies have documented carbon pricing recycling, but few focused on mixed recycling schemes that allocate revenues across multiple institutions. To fill this knowledge gap, we employ a newly developed recursive computable general equilibrium model to explore the socioeconomic consequences of various recycling schemes in the context of China. We find that: (1) Although carbon pricing promotes renewable energy, it adversely affects social welfare and urban-rural equality. When executing the recycling scheme, this negative effect is alleviated. (2) All single recycling scenarios fail to yield a double dividend. They remain detrimental to social welfare and urban-rural equality. (3) Despite small welfare loss, a moderate-share renewables-based mixed recycling scheme reduces urban-rural inequality while favoring decarbonization and energy transition.

Recycling Carbon Tax under Different Energy Efficiency Improvements: A CGE Analysis of China,"Carbon emission reductions and sustainable development have become hot issues in international conferences. As the most direct instrument for carbon emission reductions, the carbon tax has not been favored by policymakers because of its negative effect on the economy. To achieve low-carbon sustainable development, we use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate carbon tax recycling under different energy transfer efficiency improvements to achieve triple dividends of carbon emission reductions and social welfare improvement. This paper contributes to the literature on recycling carbon tax for triple dividends in China. The simulation has three main findings: (i) the carbon tax revenue recycling toward reducing the resident income tax rate yields triple dividends without any energy transfer efficiency improvement; (ii) the losses of GDP and social welfare are exaggerated. Meanwhile, the carbon tax brings down carbon emissions and total carbon intensity of GDP with a mild impact on the Chinese economy; (iii) the improvement of energy transfer efficiency demonstrates the advantages of recycling carbon tax and is essential for achieving triple dividends. Thus, we propose the following policy recommendations: (i) the pilot carbon tax mechanism should be launched in high-carbon sectors (such as coal) and then implemented in other industries gradually; (ii) the government should strongly support the technological improvement of energy transfer efficiency in order to achieve sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency

Analysing and Predicting the Geospatial Transformation of the Rural-Urban Fringe of Delhi Region in India,"This research aims to understand the long-term, large-scale geospatial transformation of the rural-urban fringe of Delhi, a megacity in India. Globalisation coupled with industrialisation has triggered the urban growth in this rural-urban fringe in an unsustainable and unplanned manner. This unchecked growth results in vast land use land cover transformation, which impacts urban and surrounding rural-urban fringe areas. Such unorganised developments result in environmental degradation, spatial fragmentation, and loss of identity of the fringe. This is a critical challenge for Delhi which is poised to become the largest urban agglomeration in the world, with a population of nearly 43 million by 2035. The existing scholarships have mostly assessed Delhi within its administrative limits but failed to analyse and establish its rural-urban structure, land use and its relationship with the emerging cities in its vicinity.This thesis takes a quantitative approach and utilises current advancements in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing. The study area spans across three states and eighteen districts, covering an area of over 16700 km2. The geospatial analysis is carried out across four main stages. First, a retrospective approach is taken to understand the land use transformation in the last thirty years (1990-2020) across five land use classes (water, vegetation, built-up, agriculture, barren). Second, exploratory spatial analysis is conducted to understand its rural-urban structure, connectivity with the fringe and spatial metrics of the landscape. Third, a predictive urban growth model is created till the year 2040 to understand the future land use scenarios and their impact on the fringe. Fourth, a long-term environmental performance analysis (2001-2020) across four key environmental indices (NDVI, precipitation, evapotranspiration, land surface temperature) is conducted to assess their influence on each other and their impact due to rapid urban growth. In this process, the research also conducts an exploratory literature review to understand and highlight the global and the Indian perspective on the rural-urban fringe study.This thesis presents new knowledge by conducting up to date and in-depth geospatial analysis of Delhi beyond its administrative limits. The study renews the focus on the rural-urban fringe and explores its vulnerability and potential as a space with its own identity. The research also establishes that Delhi cannot be studied in isolation anymore, and its growth is very much dependent on its surrounding areas, which are rapidly expanding. The methodology of this thesis is fully scalable and can be utilised to study similar cities and megacities globally.

Rapid rise in urban sprawl: Global hotspots and trends since 1990,"Dispersed low-density development-""urban sprawl""-has many detrimental environmental, economic, and social consequences. Sprawl leads to higher greenhouse-gas emissions and poses an increasing threat to the long-term availability of many vital ecosystem services. Therefore, urban sprawl is in stark contradiction to the principles of sustainable land use and to the need for a sustainability transformation. This study presents the degree of urban sprawl on the planet at multiple spatial scales (continents, UN regions, countries, sub-national units, and a regular grid) for the period 1990-2014. Urban sprawl increased by 95% in 24 years, almost 4% per year, with built-up areas growing by almost 28 km(2) per day, or 1.16 km(2) per hour. The results demonstrate that Europe has been the most sprawled and also the most rapidly sprawling continent, by 51% since 1990. At the scale of UN regions, the highest relative increases in urban sprawl were observed in East Asia, Western Africa, and Southeast Asia. Urban sprawl per capita has been highest in Oceania and North America, exhibiting a minor decline since 1990, while it has been increasing rapidly in Europe, by almost 47% since 1990. The study revealed a strong relationship between urban sprawl and the level of human development as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI). The results suggest that it will be important for a more sustainable future to find a better balance between a high quality of life and using land more sparingly. There is an urgent need to stop urban sprawl, since current regulations and measures in developed countries are apparently not effective at limiting it. Monitoring urban sprawl can serve to guide policy development such as the implementation of targets and limits and to evaluate the effectiveness of urban growth management strategies at mitigating urban sprawl.",Not About Sufficiency

Sustainable development goal 12 and its synergies with other SDGs: identification of key research contributions and policy insights,"The relationships of SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) with other sustainable development goals (SDGs), both direct and indirect, necessitate a systematic analysis to understand its pivotal role in achieving other SDGs. This work focuses on a threefold investigation through a scientometric framework. Initially, the study sought to map and analyze the naturally formed linkages between SDG 12 and other SDGs by examining the literature specifically devoted to SDG 12, thereby revealing the SDGs that are strongly linked to SDG 12. The subsequent phase of the investigation identified prominent topics related to SDG 12 that require detailed exploration. Finally, the selected topics are mined through a methodical approach termed flow vergence gradient analysis, allowing for the revelation of significant contributions within each topic. Through the analysis of the SDG linkage map, SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and SDG 15 (life on land), among others, were recognized as closely linked to SDG 12. Following this identification, five major topics—Industrial Symbiosis, Electronic waste, Carbon emissions, Life Cycle Assessment, and Green products—were deemed suitable for comprehensive mining to extract pivotal contributions. As policy recommendations, adopting a multifaceted approach to e-waste management and sustainable practices is imperative. Implementing consumption-based accounting (CBA) to achieve SDG 12 holistically will be useful.

"Carbon Sequestration Potential of the Forest Ecosystems in the Western Ghats, a Global Biodiversity Hotspot","Global warming with the burgeoning anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (400 parts per million from 280 ppm CO2 emissions of pre-industrial era) has altered climate, eroding the ecosystem productivity and sustenance of water, affecting the livelihood of people. The anthropogenic activities such as burning fossil fuel, power generation, agriculture, industry, polluting water bodies and urban activities are responsible for increasing GHG footprint of which 72% constitute CO2. GHG footprint needs to be in balance with sequestration of carbon to sustain ecosystem functions. Forests are the major carbon sinks (about 45%) that aid in mitigating global warming. The current research focusses on the carbon budgeting through quantification of emissions and sinks in the forest ecosystems and changes in climatic conditions of Western Ghats. This would help in evolving appropriate mitigation strategies toward sustainable management of forests and mitigate impacts of global warming. The land-use land-cover (LULC) dynamics are the prime driver of climate change due to the loss of carbon sequestration potential as well as emissions. The Western Ghats are one among 36 global biodiversity hotspots and forests in this region sequester atmospheric carbon, which aid in moderating the global climate and sustaining water to ensure water and food security in the peninsular India. Assessment of LULC dynamics using temporal remote sensing data shows the decline of evergreen forest by 5% with an increase in agriculture, plantations and built-up area. The interior or intact forests have declined by 10%, and they are now confined to protected areas. The simulation of likely changes indicates that the region will have only 10% evergreen cover and 17% agriculture, 40% plantations and 5% built-up. Quantification of carbon reveals that the WG forest ecosystem holds 1.23 MGg (million gigagrams or Gt) in vegetation and soils. The annual incremental carbon is about 37,507.3 Gg, (or 37.5 million tons, Mt) and the highest in the forests of Karnataka part of WG. Simulation of the likely changes in carbon content indicates the loss of 0.23 MGg (2018–2031) carbon sequestration potential under business as usual scenario. The conservation scenario depicts an increase in carbon sequestration potential of WG forests with the protection. Sequestered carbon in WG is about INR 100 billion ($1.4 billion) at carbon trading of INR 2142 ($30) per tonne. Large-scale land-cover changes leading to deforestation has contributed to an increase in mean temperature by 0.5°C and decline in rainy days, which necessitates evolving prudent landscape management strategies involving all stakeholders for conservation of ecologically fragile WG. This will enhance the ability of forests to sequester atmospheric carbon and climate moderation, with the sustenance of ecosystem goods and services.",Not About Sufficiency
"Land Cover Change from National to Global Scales: A Spatiotemporal Assessment of Trajectories, Transitions and Drivers","Changes in global land cover (LC) have significant consequences for global environmental change, impacting the sustainability of biogeochemical cycles, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and food security. Different forms of LC change have taken place across the world in recent decades due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic drivers, however, the types of change and rates of change have traditionally been hard to quantify. This thesis exploits the properties of the recently released ESA-CCI-LC product – an internally consistent, high-resolution annual time-series of global LC extending from 1992 to 2018. Specifically, this thesis uses a combination of trajectories and transition maps to quantify LC changes over time at national, continental and global scales, in order to develop a deeper understanding of what, where and when significant changes in LC have taken place and relates these to natural and anthropogenic drivers. This thesis presents three analytical chapters that contribute to achieving the objectives and the overarching aim of the thesis. The first analytical chapter initially focuses on the Nile Delta region of Egypt, one of the most densely populated and rapidly urbanising regions globally, to quantify historic rates of urbanisation across the fertile agricultural land, before modelling a series of alternative futures in which these lands are largely protected from future urban expansion. The results show that 74,600 hectares of fertile agricultural land in the Nile Delta (Old Lands) was lost to urban expansion between 1992 and 2015. Furthermore, a scenario that encouraged urban expansion into the desert and adjacent to areas of existing high population density could be achieved, hence preserving large areas of fertile agricultural land within the Nile Delta. The second analytical chapter goes on to examine LC changes across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a complex and diverse environment, through the joint lenses of political regions and ecoregions, differentiating between natural and anthropogenic signals of change and relating to likely drivers. The results reveal key LC change processes at a range of spatial scales, and identify hotspots of LC change. The major five key LC change processes were: (i) “gain of dry forests” covered the largest extent and was distributed across the whole of SSA; (ii) “greening of deserts” found adjacent to desert areas (e.g., the Sahel belt); (iii) “loss of tree-dominated savanna” extending mainly across South-eastern Africa; (iv) “loss of shrub-dominated savanna” stretching across West Africa, and “loss of tropical rainforests” unexpectedly covering the smallest extent, mainly in the DRC, West Africa and Madagascar. The final analytical chapter considers LC change at the global scale, providing a comprehensive assessment of LC gains and losses, trajectories and transitions, including a complete assessment of associated uncertainties. This chapter highlights variability between continents and identifies locations of high LC dynamism, recognising global hotspots for sustainability challenges. At the national scale, the chapter identifies the top 10 countries with the largest percentages of forest loss and urban expansion globally. The results show that the majority of these countries have stabilised their forest losses, however, urban expansion was consistently on the rise in all countries. The thesis concludes with recommendations for future research as global LC products become more refined (spatially, temporally and thematically) allowing deeper insights into the causes and consequences of global LC change to be determined.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying Social Justice in Energy Transition: A Policy-Driven Assessment Framework for China,"Addressing climate change and promoting social justice are crucial sustainable development goals. However, the quantitative assessment of how energy transition policies impact social justice remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we develop a novel Energy Transition Social Justice Framework (ETSJF) that integrates four dimensions (energy supply, energy demand, procedural justice, and distributive justice) and three perspectives (individual, group-organizational, and society). The ETSJF index is constructed to measure the progress of social justice in China's energy transition from 2010 to 2021. The index exhibits a robust growth trend, increasing from 269 in 2010 to 965 in 2021, with an average annual growth rate of 12.9%. The years 2014 and 2020-2021 mark turning points, coinciding with the implementation of transformative policy initiatives and China's carbon neutrality pledge. Employing multi-source data analysis, we evaluate the impact of energy transition policies on social justice using the Energy Transition Policy Impact Intensity (ETPII). Our analysis reveals that energy transition policies significantly positively impact overall social justice (ETPII: 1.133), with variations across dimensions. Energy supply shows the most potent effects (ETPII: 1.203), while procedural justice exhibits the weakest impact (ETPII: 0.804). These findings offer policy implications for achieving a just and inclusive energy transition. The proposed ETSJF and ETPII enable the systematic monitoring of social justice progress and offer methodological tools for policymakers to optimize energy transition policies through data-driven decision-making.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying air quality co-benefits to industrial decarbonization: the local Air Emissions Tracking Atlas,"Introduction Many decarbonization technologies have the added co-benefit of reducing short-lived climate pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), creating a unique opportunity for identifying strategies that promote both climate change solutions and opportunities for air quality improvement. However, stakeholders and decision-makers may struggle to quantify how these co-benefits will impact public health for the communities most affected by industrial air pollution.Methods To address this problem, the LOCal Air Emissions Tracking Atlas (LOCAETA) fills a data availability and analysis gap by providing estimated air quality benefits from industrial decarbonization options, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). These co-benefits are calculated using an algorithm that connects disparate datasets that separately report greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants at U.S. industrial facilities.Results Version 1.0 of LOCAETA displays the estimated primary PM2.5 emission reduction co-benefits from additional pretreatment equipment for CCS on industrial and power facilities across the state of Louisiana, as well as the potential for VOC and NH3 generation. The emission reductions are presented in the tool alongside facility pollutant emissions information and relevant air quality, environmental, demographic, and public health datasets, such as air toxics cancer risk, satellite and in situ pollutant measurements, and population vulnerability metrics.Discussion LOCAETA enables regulators, policymakers, environmental justice communities, and industrial and commercial users to compare and contrast quantifiable public health benefits due to air quality impacts from various climate change mitigation strategies using a free and publicly-available tool. Additional pollutant reductions can be calculated using the same methodology and will be available in future versions of the tool.",Not About Sufficiency
"Pursuing China's provincial sustainable development goals within a safe and just operating space: Past, present and future","As emphasized by the challenging sustainable development agenda, countries are facing a complicated combination of environmental stress and social challenges, leading the Earth system towards an unsustainable path. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately assess past fluctuations contributing to current situations and apprehend plausible future implications. This study integrates safe and just operating space (SJOS) with Sustainable Development Goals to depict multiple ""windows"" of environmental and social evolution in different historical periods, with 31 provinces in China as a case study. Then, we track the spatiotemporal evolution trajectory of environmental performance and social well-being in each province from 2012 to 2021. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is utilized to capture the temporal relationships between various indicators and to forecast the spatial trends of SJOS in the provinces from 2022 to 2030. Research findings indicate that: (1) over the 2012-2021 period, the environmental performance of the majority of provinces far exceeds the warning thresholds, with no province falling within all threshold boundaries simultaneously. The phosphorus cycle is the most challenging boundary, with only 6.8% of provinces within the safe boundary over the past 10 years. In comparison, freshwater use performs the best, with 80% of provinces staying within the threshold. (2) Social well-being generally improves across all provinces from 2012 to 2021, but the spatial and temporal trajectories are more varied. All provinces meet the thresholds for the food security and employment indicators. However, none of the provinces meet the standard for the social equity indicator. (3) Over the 2022-2030 projection period, environmental performance and social well-being trend in opposite directions across provinces. This culminates in no province being entirely within the safe and just space by 2030. Sanitation shows the most significant change compared to other indicators. Xinjiang had the largest improvement at 59.12%, while Tianjin had the most significant downward trend at 53.88%. Adjustments in national policies and priorities are essential if China wants to accomplish the sufficiency of biophysical resources whilst ensuring social equity in the access and exploitation of these resources.",Not About Sufficiency
Public Policies for Renewable Energy: A Review of the Perspectives for a Circular Economy,"The development and implementation of public policies towards renewable energies are crucial in order to address the contemporary challenges faced by humanity. The 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle), as a circular economic practice, are often cited as one of the best solutions for sustainable development. Therefore, this study analyzed public policies for renewable energy from the perspective of the circular economy. Accordingly, a systematic review of the literature was carried out with respect to the beneficiaries and convergences of circularities, with a focus on public policies for renewable energies. The sample had public policies classified into three types (distributive, redistributive, and regulatory policies). The results showed that the first studies began in 1999, with a significant increase in publications during the 2010s, in which Germany was the country with the greatest contribution. The analyses associated with space showed the countries committed to the use of renewable energies and the 3Rs of the circular economy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The economic analyses revealed that the circular economy for the generation of renewable energy has a positive economic return in terms of social well-being and the mitigation of environmental degradation. There is a barrier to the circular economy's development posed by the cost of its implementation in the private sector and the resistance to raising awareness in society, requiring strong public sector engagement in decision making and the constant evaluation of public policies. It is concluded that the circular economy facilitates more efficient, productive structures and public policies, promoting alternatives for energy security and sustainability for the world energy matrix.",Not About Sufficiency
Public participation GIS scenarios for decision-making on land-use requirements for renewable energy systems,"BackgroundThe transition to renewable energy is crucial for decarbonising the energy system but creates land-use competition. Whilst there is consensus on the need for local responsibility in achieving climate neutrality, debates continue over where to implement renewable energy plants. The Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) scenario approach can facilitate these debates and improve equity and procedural and distributive justice.ResultsThe findings highlight the effectiveness of the PPGIS method in assessing the spatial impact of technologies on agriculture and landscapes. The approach was tested in a rural German municipality to help stakeholders and citizens recognise the potential for land-based solar energy even under strict constraints. These insights were shared to support decision-makers on land-use changes to increase renewable energy production.ConclusionsThe findings indicate that the PPGIS scenario approach is valuable for improving equity and mutual understanding in local decision-making processes. Incorporating stakeholders' and citizens' perspectives into renewable energy planning enhances the transparency, legitimacy, and acceptability of land-use decisions. The ability to visualise and quantitatively assess different scenarios makes PPGIS particularly useful for addressing the complexities of public debates on land-use requirements for renewable energy systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Provisioning for sufficiency: envisaging production corridors,"This article deepens the framework of a sufficiency economy, defining sufficiency as the space between a floor of meeting needs and a ceiling of ungeneralizable excess. This framework can be applied to the domains of consumption and production. Complementing existing research on consumption corridors, our aim is to conceptualize the idea of a production corridor. To develop this notion, we survey a range of helpful concepts starting with objective and universal human needs to establish a “floor” and planetary boundaries to establish a “ceiling.” We then assess in some detail a range of conceptual debates that pertain to production: 1) Marxian categories of labor, 2) the production boundary, 3) provisioning and the foundational economy, 4) social reproduction, and 5) unnecessary labor. These debates permit us to start identifying essential production, which enables the satisfaction of human needs within planetary boundaries, and excess production, which contributes neither to need satisfaction nor human flourishing but drives planetary overshoot. This distinction further allows for an “in-between” domain of the economy, situated between the floor and ceiling. This discussion concludes with a more detailed model of production embedded in the framework of the sufficiency economy. We then “dynamize” this model to sketch a production corridor under climate-mitigation imperatives. It considers in turn the essential economy, the excess economy, and the in-between economy. The final section summarizes our depiction of the production corridor leading to rapid but fair decarbonization of the economy.",Not About Sufficiency

Provincial equity and enhanced health are key drivers for China's 2060 carbon neutrality,"China's ambitious 2060 carbon neutrality target necessitates innovative strategies to address the country's status as the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. This study employs the Global Change Analysis Model to develop a provincial-differentiated control strategy (EQU scenario) that not only aims to meet the national carbon neutrality goal but also enhances population health and environmental equity. The EQU scenario forecasts substantial reductions in average population weighted PM2.5 and O3 concentrations to 7 mu g/m3 and 34 ppb, respectively, by 2060. In comparison to a baseline scenario (NEU), the EQU scenario offers more equitable air quality improvements and significant health benefits, potentially preventing 39 thousand PM2.5-related and 10 thousand O3-related premature deaths, with minimal additional cost. The Gini coefficient, indicating CO2 emission distribution inequality among provinces, is projected to decrease from 0.58 in NEU to 0.37 in EQU. This scenario anticipates about one-third of provinces achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, with a harmonized provincial carbon neutrality capacity. The study highlights the critical importance of integrating provincially differentiated controls within national decarbonization strategies, advancing equitable deep decarbonization and reinforcing environmental justice in China.",Not About Sufficiency
Projecting spatial interactions between global population and land use changes in the 21st century,"Previous research on global urban land expansion has primarily focused on accommodating the growing population without adequately considering the trade-offs between urban land and ecological services. Consequently, it is important to investigate the effect of this expansion on the ecological service system, while also examining the potential trade-offs between population growth and available urban land. Here, we quantify how different global land expansion options contribute to reconciling global population changes and to compliance with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and human settlements. Using an integrated framework for projecting global land consumption with the trade-off strategy between global land expansion and population under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), we aim to bridge the knowledge gap in this area. The results of our study suggest that implementing a trade-off strategy between global land expansion and population growth can successfully reduce the levels of global land consumption in the future. Under the SSP1 scenario, for instance, our findings indicate that implementing trade-off policies can significantly reduce land consumption while increasing carbon sinks and protecting the global ecological service system. Specifically, converting land to forest or grassland can help decrease land consumption by 8.07% by the end of the 21st century. These insights can be valuable in designing land use policies that incorporate data-based solutions and address the challenges of sustainable urban development while also accommodating population growth.",Not About Sufficiency

Principles for a sustainable circular economy,"The pressure that the human species exerts on the natural environment through the extraction of materials and generation of wastes is widely recognised. Circular economy has emerged as a potential solution to make better use of resources. Positioned as a technology-focused concept that can generate economic gains while alleviating pressure on the environment, circular economy enjoys a positive reception by organisations in public, private and civic sectors and, increasingly, academia alike. However, concerns have been raised regarding some purported circular economy practices being promoted as 'sustainable' yet resulting in detrimental impacts on environment and society. We briefly revisit the systems ecology literature that construed the context for both circular economy and sustainable development. Values and principles in core sustainable development literature are analysed to offer a foundation against which circular economy can be discussed. We then analyse and critically reflect upon the strengths, shortcomings and theoretical flaws within the values and principles that emerged from the evolving circular economy literature. We propose a value framework and set of ten principles for the design, implementation and evaluation of a sustainable circular economy. We finish with a call for action for both practitioners and a research agenda for academia. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Pricing Strategy and Social Welfare in a Supply Chain With Different Rights Structure Under Carbon Tax Policy,"Aiming at the pricing and emission reduction decision-making problem of a two-level supply chain consisting of multiple manufacturers and multiple retailers, this paper proposes a consistent pricing mechanism based on multi-agent structure to coordinate the supply chain, and the operation of supply chain participants from competition to cooperation. The proposed algorithm is distributed and collaborative, thus eliminating the need for a central snap-ins, central price coordinators, or leaders. Firstly, a two-level supply chain social welfare model with multi-agent structure is established, and the system nodes in this model are scalable. Then, the pricing and carbon tax policies of the supply chain under different dominant rights are discussed to determine the optimal transaction price and carbon tax policies in order to maximize social welfare. The research results show that the transaction price increases with the increase of the carbon tax rate, and the social welfare decreases with the increase of the carbon tax rate, so the government should formulate the carbon tax within a reasonable range. It is also found that the overall social welfare obtained when there is no dominant node is higher than the social welfare obtained when there is dominant node. It can guide the market to optimize the allocation of resources according to production needs, so as to achieve the maximum efficient use and social welfare.",Not About Sufficiency
Pricing decisions and social welfare in a supply chain with multiple competing retailers and carbon tax policy,"This paper investigates whether implementing carbon tax policy alters supply chain members' pricing decisions and social welfare. We also consider consumer environmental awareness (CEA), which is currently growing, and we focus on the impact of CEA, retail competitive intensity and other factors on the optimal carbon tax rate and social welfare. We address the issue from the point of view of a policy planner whose goal is to maximize social welfare. Additionally, we consider two different market scenarios: a bilateral monopoly situation and a scenario with multiple competing retailers. In terms of the impact on pricing, the retail price and wholesale price increase with the carbon tax rate in both scenarios. The market demand for the retailer that sells a more environmentally friendly product relative to other competing retailers will increase with the carbon tax rate in the scenario with competing retailers. Additionally, the government's carbon tax regulation at the optimal tax rate can effectively improve social welfare when carbon emissions per unit of product are large or the price of carbon dioxide is high in both scenarios, regardless of the extent of CEA. Further, when the competitive strength of an industry in the retail market is high, the government can also implement carbon tax regulation to reduce social welfare losses. Moreover, compared with the monopoly situation, the intuitive carbon tax rate is closer to the optimal carbon tax rate in the competitive situation, and thus, it will be better able to reduce social welfare losses.

Predicting land use changes and ecosystem service impacts with CA-Markov and machine learning techniques,"Urban ecosystem services play a vital role in increasing resilience against environmental challenges, providing human well-being benefits, and conserving biodiversity within rapidly urbanizing areas. This study investigates land use and land cover (LULC) changes across three districts in Telangana -Medchal-Malkajgiri, Warangal, and Ranga Reddy-over the past several decades, specifically their effects on ecosystem service values (ESV). Utilizing the Benefit Transfer Methodology, we assessed the effects of urban expansion on ESV by measuring significant increases in built-up areas that have replaced natural landscapes. This transformation has resulted in decreased capacity to provide essential ecosystem services such as climate regulation, water quality regulation and biodiversit & Aring;y conservation. Water bodies emerged as key contributors to ecosystem services provision-emphasizing their significance for urban resilience. Medchal-Malkajgiri, Warangal and Ranga Reddy districts in Telangana are experiencing rapid urbanization as a result of Hyderabad's expansion and rapid infrastructure development. This transformation of agricultural lands into urbanized spaces threatens ecosystem services such as water resources and biodiversity while jeopardizing long-term environmental sustainability-this study evaluates these effects and offers essential insight for planning sustainable urban environments. Our results reveal a responsive relationship between ecosystem services (ESV) and land use change (LULC), such that changes to land use directly impact ecosystem service availability and quality. Our findings offer actionable insights to policymakers by emphasizing the necessity for urban planning strategies which prioritize ecosystem preservation alongside development to foster sustainable urban growth.",Not About Sufficiency
Green Growth Analysis of Social Development in OECD Countries,"This paper seeks to elucidate the inter and intrarelationships between a selected set of OECD green growth indicators (GGI). In addition to the selected GGI, the analysis includes the Human Development Index (HDI) and its sub-indicators. The novelty of the analysis comes from the incorporation of these established indicators, which have been utilised and developed to reflect human well-being and prosperity for decades. Production-based CO2 intensity and emission change are significantly correlated to average length of schooling across the 36 countries that were members of the OECD in the year 2019. Longer years spent in school on average can facilitate the green transition of countries. The correlations among intra-GGI also suggest where OECD countries are lagging in terms of green transition. For example, renewable energy supply share in energy and air transport-related CO2 per capita are positively correlated in the countries. This indicates that countries with a successful path toward green energy are not paying much attention to their high level of CO2 emissions caused by aviation. Infrastructural and technological advancement as well as increased public awareness are needed to challenge such issues.",Not About Sufficiency
Powering a Sustainable and Circular Economy-An Engineering Approach to Estimating Renewable Energy Potentials within Earth System Boundaries,"This study proposes a method to estimate the appropriability of renewable energy resources at the global scale, when Earth system boundaries/needs and the human demand for chemical energy are respected. The method is based on an engineering approach, i.e., uncertainties of parameters and models are considered and potentials calculated with 99% confidence. We used literature data to test our method and provide initial results for global appropriable technical potentials (ATP) that sum up to 71TW, which is significantly larger than the current global energy demand. Consequently, there is sufficient renewable energy potentially available to increase energy access for a growing world population as well as for a development towards increasingly closed material cycles within the technosphere. Solar energy collected on the built environment (29%) and in desert areas (69%) represent the dominant part of this potential, followed in great distance by hydro (0.6%), terrestrial heat (0.4%), wind (0.35%), and biomass (0.2%). Furthermore, we propose indicators to evaluate an energy mix on different levels, from an energy mix in single products to the mix used by the global economy, against the estimated RE potentials, which allow an evaluation and consideration in the design of sustainable-circular products and systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Poverty Alleviation Through Accounting and Partnerships: A Systematic Review and Future Research Directions,"This study analyzes carbon accounting (CA) and true cost accounting (TCA) to measure decarbonization practices to meet the sustainable development goal (SDG) 1 (end poverty in all its forms everywhere). These tools can empower firms to achieve insightful data to pursue a balance between economic, environmental, and social goals. This study also investigates the role of partnerships (SDG 17) in sharing resources and knowledge while adopting decarbonization practices to achieve SDG1. Leveraging SDG17 to meet SDG1 and the overall business model, this study introduces the concept of poverty alleviation business models. This study analyzed 172 articles published between 1990 and 2024 from the Scopus database and Google Scholar using descriptive, bibliometric, and network analyses as well as content analysis. The results highlight that CA helps firms develop decarbonization strategies to promote sustainable practices for SDG1 based on partnerships. This study also highlights that TCA evaluates the economic, social, and environmental impacts of firms' activities, enabling sustainable decision-making and identifying opportunities for poverty alleviation business models. This study provides a pioneering analysis of corporate decarbonization by examining how firms can develop a balanced business model that integrates economic, environmental, and social goals, specifically SDG1. This study explores on the one hand CA and TCA as managerial tools for measuring decarbonization practices through new technologies and renewable resources and, on the other hand, SDG17, particularly Target 17.G, to advance SDG1. This study contributes a novel conceptual framework for poverty alleviation business models that has not been adequately addressed in the history of accounting research.",Not About Sufficiency
"Potentials for prosperity without growth: Ecological sustainability, social inclusion and the quality of life in 38 countries","Recent contributions to ecological economics and related social sciences indicate that issues such as climate change, resource depletion and environmental degradation cannot be effectively addressed under conditions of continued economic growth. This paper aims at empirically identifying structural potentials and policy challenges for prosperity at scales where economic development remains within ecological carrying capacities. Building on the growing literature that interprets prosperity 'beyond' economic growth, the paper presents a three-dimensional concept to operationalise prosperity in terms of ecological sustainability, social inclusion, and the quality of life. These dimensions are measured using data from sources such as The World Bank, the Global Footprint Network and the OECD. The results of cluster and correspondence analyses indicate the existence of five 'prosperity regimes' and demonstrate that all aspects of prosperity - including (unsatisfactory) ecological performance - are linked to economic development. However, our findings also indicate that in order to achieve a decent minimum of prosperity moderate levels of the material living standard are sufficient Further increases in the material living standard do not lead to significant additional prosperity; instead they cause greater environmental harms. The paper concludes by highlighting potentials for prosperity for each of the 'prosperity regimes' and corresponding policy challenges. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Politicising Circular Economy: what can we learn from Responsible Innovation?,"The 'Circular Economy' has become a new buzzword in debates about sustainability. Circularity, however, is usually presented in terms of scientific and technological challenges that often neglect the socio-political aspects related to the transition towards more sustainable futures, such as participation, co-creation and social justice. We argue that the Circular Economy agenda might greatly benefit from the field of Responsible Innovation. This argument is at the centre of the EU funded project, 'A Just Transition to Circular Economy' (JUST2CE), which aspires to address the present shortcomings of Circular Economy literature and practices. JUST2CE aims at understanding, in a critical way, under which conditions a responsible, inclusive and socially just transition to a Circular Economy is possible and desirable, what technical, political and social factors can enable or hamper such transformation and how these aspects can contribute to the development of transitional policy measures.",Not About Sufficiency
Policies for energy conservation and sufficiency: Review of existing policies and recommendations for new and effective policies in OECD countries,"There is a strong consent among scholars and policy makers that limiting current global energy demand and gradually reducing it towards a sustainable level of consumption is a key component of any strategies and pathways to reach the Paris Agreement climate target, and, in particular, carbon neutrality by mid-century. Given the stringency and urgency of the climate target and the current global increase of energy demand, in addition to investments in energy efficiency technologies, there is the need for a change of energy end-users behaviour and life style to obtain additional energy savings by limiting the demand for services. Traditionally, energy efficiency policies have mainly targeted and promoted energy efficient technologies (e.g., energy performance standards for vehicles, appliances and buildings, financial incen-tives for new technologies, etc.). In some cases, the energy savings achieved have been less than expected, due to a rebound effect, or because external factors (e.g., growth in populations or economies) have increased energy consumption. The ""traditional"" energy efficiency policies are still very necessary, but are not sufficient for reaching the Paris Agreement target and the rapid reduction of the energy demand. Policies focusing on energy conservation and sufficiency principles complement efficiency policies, in particular those aiming at changing end-user consumer behaviour and lifestyle by imposing some limi-tation to the demand for energy services. The article first reviews the concept of energy savings compared to energy efficiency and introduce the concept of energy sufficiency. Then the article explores and dis-cusses some existing and new policy instruments that can address energy conservation and sufficiency such as: personal carbon allowances; energy/carbon taxation; progressive appliance and vehicles stan-dards, and progressive building codes. The article's focus is mainly on individual end-users and on resi-dential buildings. Finally, the article provides an ex-ante assessment of the policies analysed, including their limitations, and offers some policy recommendations, based on a combination of instruments.(c) 2022 The Author.

"Pluralizing energy justice: Incorporating feminist, anti-racist, Indigenous, and postcolonial perspectives","Justice represents not only a moral obligation but can enhance the legitimacy and acceptance of a rapid push toward global decarbonization. Innovations in technology, even those geared toward sustainability, can both reinforce and introduce new inequalities and disparities across populations, while also perpetuating environmental degradation. The concept of energy justice has emerged as a conceptual, methodological, and empirical tool to both highlight and remediate many of these concerns, with an emphasis on what is morally just or right. But much of this body of scholarship fails to adequately account for gender, Indigeneity, race, and other intersecting inequalities. Feminist, Indigenous, anti-racist and postcolonial approaches to justice offer an important remedy to theories of justice with underlying colonial, liberalist, majoritarian, utilitarian, or masculinist assumptions. Our Perspective is grounded in these four core, but often misperceived or even radical, approaches to justice. We first provide an overview of each of these approaches and then synthesize them into a set of themes, principles, and questions, which can guide future energy justice research and practice.",Not About Sufficiency
Playing for the Planet? A Serious Game Approach to Land Use Planning with Students in Rural Iceland,"Effective nature conservation and citizen participation are essential for sustainable development and biodiversity preservation. This paper introduces the 'Land Use Game', a prototype serious game designed to engage citizens-particularly younger demographics-in participatory land use planning. Developed within the context of the EU Horizon 2020 PHOENIX project, the game was tested with students in two rural Icelandic municipalities as part of a pilot study. The game enables participants to assign land use preferences through interactive mapping, supporting a better understanding of land use complexities while promoting active learning and dialogue. The study evaluates the game's feasibility, technological features, and practical applications, highlighting insights from gameplay observations, participant feedback, and spatial analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of serious games to collect meaningful data, support inclusive decision-making, and empower citizens to contribute to sustainable policies. By incorporating such tools, planners can enhance public understanding, promote equitable land use, and strengthen participatory democracy.",Not About Sufficiency
"Plastic Pollution, Waste Management Issues, and Circular Economy Opportunities in Rural Communities","Rural areas are exposed to severe environmental pollution issues fed by industrial and agricultural activities combined with poor waste and sanitation management practices, struggling to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in line with Agenda 2030. Rural communities are examined through a ""dual approach"" as both contributors and receivers of plastic pollution leakage into the natural environment (through the air-water-soil-biota nexus). Despite the emerging trend of plastic pollution research, in this paper, we identify few studies investigating rural communities. Therefore, proxy analysis of peer-reviewed literature is required to outline the significant gaps related to plastic pollution and plastic waste management issues in rural regions. This work focuses on key stages such as (i) plastic pollution effects on rural communities, (ii) plastic pollution generated by rural communities, (iii) the development of a rural waste management sector in low- and middle-income countries in line with the SDGs, and (iv) circular economy opportunities to reduce plastic pollution in rural areas. We conclude that rural communities must be involved in both future plastic pollution and circular economy research to help decision makers reduce environmental and public health threats, and to catalyze circular initiatives in rural areas around the world, including less developed communities.",Not About Sufficiency
Plant Power: Opportunities and challenges for meeting sustainable energy needs from the plant and fungal kingdoms,"Societal Impact Statement Bioenergy is a major component of the global transition to renewable energy technologies. The plant and fungal kingdoms offer great potential but remain mostly untapped. Their increased use could contribute to the renewable energy transition and addressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 ""Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all."" Current research focuses on species cultivated at scale in temperate regions, overlooking the wealth of potential new sources of small-scale energy where they are most urgently needed. A shift towards diversified, accessible bioenergy technologies will help to mitigate and adapt to the threats of climate change, decrease energy poverty, improve human health by reducing indoor pollution, increase energy resilience of communities, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. SummaryBioenergy derived from plants and fungi is a major component of the global transition to renewable energy technologies. There is rich untapped diversity in the plant and fungal kingdoms that offers potential to contribute to the shift away from fossil fuels and to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) ""Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all."" Energy poverty-the lack of access to modern energy services-is most acute in the Global South where biodiversity is greatest and least investigated. Our systematic review of the literature over the last 5 years (2015-2020) indicates that research efforts have targeted a very small number of plant species cultivated at scale, mostly in temperate regions. The wealth of potential new sources of bioenergy in biodiverse regions, where the implementation of SDG7 is most urgently needed, has been largely overlooked. We recommend next steps for bioenergy stakeholders-research, industry, and government-to seize opportunities for innovation to alleviate energy poverty while protecting biodiversity. Small-scale energy production using native plant species in bioenergy landscapes overcomes many pitfalls associated with bioenergy crop monocultures, such as biodiversity loss and conflict with food production. Targeted trait-based screening of plant species and biological screening of fungi are required to characterize the potential of this resource. The benefits of diversified, accessible bioenergy go beyond the immediate urgency of energy poverty as more diverse agricultural landscapes are more resilient, store more carbon, and could also reduce the drivers of the climate and environmental emergencies.",Not About Sufficiency
Planetary Boundaries for Forests and Their National Exceedance,"Achieving forest sustainability is a declared sustainable development goal (SDG 15). Measuring the safe operating space-planetary boundaries-of global forests is essential to determine global forest pressure and manage forests sustainably. Here, we quantify the forestry planetary boundary (FPB) and national forestry boundaries. Results show that, in 2015, the FPB was 7.1 billion m3 of forest stock increments. Global timber harvests account for 58.7% of the FPB. Timber harvests of 47 nations, mostly in Africa and Asia, have exceeded their national forestry boundaries. Their boundary-exceeding timber harvest is mainly driven by the final demand of developed nations (e.g., the United States and Japan) and emerging economies (e.g., India and China) through global supply chains. This study highlights the importance of the FPB in global forest management and trade-related policymaking. The findings can guide global and national forest harvesting activities and help promote international cooperation to mitigate global deforestation.",Not About Sufficiency
Bio-energy and the environment: Land of possible misunderstanding,"Climate change, environmental degradation, agriculture decline burdened with heavy socio-economic implications and increasing energy needs for sustainable development and economic growth, have stimulated a frenetic search for acceptable solutions to improve this critical situation.

Piercing the corporate veil: Towards a better assessment of the position of transnational oil and gas companies in the global carbon budget,"In recent years, research in climate science has increasingly emphasized the need to reduce fossil fuel supply in order to avoid an overshoot of the global carbon budget and to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global warming 'well below 2 degrees C'. This article aims to outline a balanced appreciation of the particular responsibility held by transnational oil and gas companies in the global challenge to organize an equitably managed decline in fossil fuel extraction. It does so by focusing on a case study. The latter consists of the stylized reconstruction of the internal social dynamics that shape the power structure of the French firm Total and of questioning its ability to make investment decisions aligned with the imperative to preserve the stability of the climate system, as its public position makes clear. The persistence of short-termed compensation schemes in the higher corporate hierarchy impedes the elaboration and implementation of deep decarbonization strategies at the firm level. These would imply a significant upscaling of investments in renewable energy and/or carbon-capture storage technologies, in order to avoid the foreseeable destruction of corporate jobs linked to oil and gas extraction in an increasingly carbon-constrained world.",Not About Sufficiency

Science and policy implications of defining environmental justice,"Although 'environmental justice' is an increasingly important issue for policy makers and researchers, it remains for many a vague and abstract notion that is hard to define in practical, real-world terms. Part of the problem is that environmental justice is a complex, multidimensional construct that cannot easily be defined. Our aim in this article is to identify fundamental dimensions of environmental justice and highlight the resulting questions that are an inherent part of putting principles into practice. We argue that to have a constructive and informed debate about this emotionally charged topic, it is necessary to have a clear and workable definition of environmental justice. We do not propose our own definition, but instead point out that there are many possible legitimate definitions depending on one's beliefs, opinions, and values. The central point is not that a particular definition is right or wrong, but rather that choosing a definition has distinct implications for the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of both policy and science. These critical choices should be made explicit so that public dialogue can focus on the substance of this important policy issue.",Not About Sufficiency
Do sustainable development goals (SDGs) boost green productivity in national marine fisheries? International evidence,"ObjectiveThis study examines the determinants of green total factor productivity in marine fisheries, considering the role of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) in promoting sustainable marine resource utilization and conservation.MethodsThis study employs panel data from 57 countries between 2001 and 2021 to estimate efficiency scores through the directional distance function and the Malmquist–Luenberger model by incorporating inputs (labor, fishing vessels, and energy consumption) and outputs (gross ocean product and carbon dioxide emissions). A truncated regression analysis is conducted to explore the relationship between SDG 14 and green total factor productivity (GTFP) while controlling for financial resources and macroeconomic indicators.ResultThe findings indicate that SDG 14 significantly enhances both constant returns to scale (CRS) technical efficiency and variable returns to scale (VRS) pure technical efficiency, underscoring the importance of marine conservation and sustainable resource management. Additionally, financial resources (like green lending and government investment), research and innovation (like research and development, the number of researchers, and foreign funds), and macroeconomic factors (like the gross ocean product, gross domestic product, and inflation) positively influence green productivity.ConclusionThe results underscore the importance of marine conservation and sustainable practices for enhancing GTFP in fisheries. Integrated policies focusing on financial investment, innovation, and macroeconomic stability are essential to achieve greater sustainability and efficiency in this sector.",Not About Sufficiency
Personal Mobility Choices and Disparities in Carbon Emissions,"This study demonstrates the existinggaps in mobility justiceand climate justice in the largest Canadian metropolitan area. The promotion of sustainable mobility choices is a crucialelementof transport decarbonization.

In this study, we quantifiedpersonal mobility-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the GreaterToronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) and their associations with variousland use, built environment, and socioeconomic factors. Our studycaptured personal, household, and neighborhood-level characteristicsthat are related to high emissions and disparities in emissions acrossthe study region. We observed that the top 30% of emitters generated70% of all transportation GHG emissions. Household income, familysize, and vehicle ownership were associated with increased mobilityemissions, while increased population density was associated withlower emissions. The percentage of visible minorities in a neighborhoodwas associated with lower emissions, but this effect was small. Wefurther contrasted the spatial distribution of traffic-related airpollution with mobility GHG emissions.

Perceived social welfare as a driver of green products consumption: Evidences from an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture production,"This study investigated consumers' perceptions of green products derived from a circular economy production, by shedding light on the role of perceived social welfare. Furthermore, the paper considered two moderators: perceptual variables on green products and psychological variables on the environment. The analysis was per-formed in the aquaculture sector-specifically referring to Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) pro-duction as a research setting. Respondents received a structured questionnaire containing scales that measured perceived social welfare, environmentalism, green product's perception (in terms of price, quality and useful-ness), purchase intention, and word-of-mouth. The results revealed an inverse relationship between perceived social welfare and the behavioral variables. Consumers were more attracted to and focused on the green product's usefulness than its price and quality. Moreover, the study found that environmentalism (in terms of environmental concern and perceived consumer effectiveness) moderate the effect of perceived social welfare on dependent variables. By exploring the role of perceived social welfare as a regressor, this study improves our understanding of consumers' behavior toward green products.",Not About Sufficiency
"Impact of Land Use Change on the Habitat Quality Evolution in Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China","Habitat quality (HQ) is an important indicator to characterize the level of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and can reflect the quality of the human living environment. Changes in land use can disturb regional HQ. Current research mostly focuses on assessing the good or bad quality of regional habitats, and less on the spatial response relationship between land use change and HQ, and even fewer studies on finely distinguishing the impact of land use types on HQ. Therefore, taking Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) of China as the study area, this paper first analyzes the land use change of study area by using the land use transfer matrix, land use rate model and landscape pattern index, and then combines the InVEST model with the multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model to build a refined assessment framework to quantitatively assess the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of HQ, and then analyse in detail the spatial response relationship of each land use type change on the impact of HQ. The results showed that from 2000 to 2020, the land use in the TGRA shows a changing state of “urban expansion, cultivated land shrinkage, forest land growth, and grassland degradation”. With the change in land use, the habitat quality index (HQI) in the study area showed an “ increase first and then decline” change characteristics, and the HQ degradation was more obvious in the areas with intense human activities. The impact of land use change over the past 20 years on HQ in the TGRA has significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with changes in paddy and dryland having mainly negative impacts on HQ, and changes in sparse land, shrubland, and medium-cover grassland having mainly positive impacts on HQ. This paper mainly provides a research framework for refined assessment, and the results can provide scientific support for land planning and ecological protection in the TGRA, and the research methods and ideas can provide references for similar research.",Not About Sufficiency
Pathways to zero emissions in California's heavy-duty transportation sector,"California contributes 0.75% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and has a target of reaching economy-wide net zero emissions by 2045, requiring all sectors to rapidly reduce emissions. Nearly 8% of California's GHG emissions are from the heavy-duty transportation sector. In this work, we simulate decarbonization strategies for the heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) fleet using detailed fleet turnover and air quality models to track evolution of the fleet, GHG and criteria air pollutant emissions, and resulting air quality and health impacts across sociodemographic groups. We assess the effectiveness of two types of policies: zero emission vehicle sales mandates, and accelerated retirement policies. For policies including early retirements, we estimate the cost of early retirements and the cost-effectiveness of each policy. We find even a policy mandating all HDV sales to be zero emission vehicles by 2025 would not achieve fleetwide zero emissions by 2045. For California to achieve its goal of carbon neutrality, early retirement policies are needed. We find that a combination of early retirement policies and zero emission vehicle sales mandates could reduce cumulative CO2 emissions by up to 64%. Furthermore, we find that decarbonization policies will significantly reduce air pollution-related mortality, and that Black, Latino, and low-income communities will benefit most. We find that policies targeting long-haul heavy-heavy duty trucks would have the greatest benefits and be most cost-effective.",Not About Sufficiency

Techno-environmental analysis to valorize the secondary energy resources from refuse-derived fuel-based waste to energy plant,"The present study quantifies the environmental and sustainability impacts associated with municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in India which plays a vital environmental issue in recent times. The upsurge in population has resulted in massive waste generation, leading to a concerning rise in the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, the sustainable management of MSW has been discussed and highlights the conversion of MSW into refuse-derived fuel (RDF) to identify its potential for generating electricity in waste-to-energy (WtE) plants. The life cycle assessment (LCA) study has been done to identify and compare the environmental impacts associated with different scenarios (SC) as SC1: landfilling without energy recovery, SC2: open burning and SC3: processing of RDF in WtE plant by considering the nine impact categories from the inventory data obtained over a period of 12 consecutive months (Jan 2021–Jan 2022). The results exhibited that the global warming potential caused by emissions of GHG are in the order of SC1 (1188 kg CO2 eq) > SC2 (752 kg CO2 eq) > SC3 (332 kg CO2 eq), respectively from 1 t of MSW. It is concluded that the WtE plant can help in the reduction of environmental issues, strengthening the capacity of electricity generation and improving the aesthetic view of the city which is socially acceptable as well. Thus, WtE technology can help in achieving sustainable development goal 12 to regenerate the sustainable secondary resources for the twenty-first century and minimize global climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
International justice and environmental policy: tradeable permits for carbon emissions,"Several proposals have been put forward for the restriction of global carbon emissions as being justified in the interests of environmental justice or other ethical grounds. In the first part of this paper the more popular of these are discussed, and it is argued that their ethical foundations are, in fact, very flimsy. This is followed by an examination of the concept of ""environmental justice', which is explicit or implicit in much of the literature on equity aspects of environmental policy, and it is concluded that such a concept, as distinct from justice in general, is not a useful one. The main central section of the paper goes on to discuss, more generally, what principals of international justice can be identified that might have practical application to problems such as those of sharing internationally the burdens of environmental protection. A final section of the paper puts forward some concrete proposals for the initial allocation of carbon emissions, and argues that these represent a reasonable compromise between alternative equitable criteria. -from Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Toward a just circular economy: conceptualizing environmental labor and gender justice in circularity studies,"Over the past decade, the concept of circular economy (CE) has gained political traction as a potential solution to economy-environment tradeoffs. However, critical social scientists have raised concerns that CE may not address the root causes or consequences of environmental degradation, thus remaining ineffective. Concurring with this critique, this article highlights three constituent elements of the linear economy that remain unaddressed in CE frameworks: environmental, labor, and gender inequalities. Building upon scholarship from environmental justice, environmental labor studies, and feminist ecological economics, we elaborate a conceptual framework to interrogate the existing literature. Our analysis shows that current CE models 1) are mainly concerned with return on capital investment and sustained growth of gross domestic product (GDP) rather than with redressing the North/South inequalities embedded in the linear economy model; 2) present a limited perspective on labor, with a primary focus on the number of jobs to be created, rather than their quality, or workers’ leadership; and 3) overlook gender inequalities and the sexual division of labor, thus reproducing the devaluation of care that lays at the roots of socioecological crises.

"Barriers, Challenges, and Opportunities in the Adoption of the Circular Economy in Mexico: An Analysis through Social Perception","This study explores the transition toward sustainable economic models through the circular economy (CE) in Mexico. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, this research incorporates a comprehensive literature review and analyzes responses from 42 stakeholders, gathered through surveys and focus groups. These stakeholders comprise a diverse group including PhD students, professors, researchers, industry professionals in sustainability and the environment, and government advisors and coordinators from the Mexican Secretary of Environment. This representative sample provides a broad perspective on the barriers, opportunities, and societal perceptions regarding CE. The findings reveal significant challenges such as economic barriers, regulatory inadequacies, and a lack of awareness and education, all of which hinder the adoption of CE practices. Despite these challenges, there is a generally optimistic view among stakeholders about CE’s potential to positively impact societal needs, suggesting robust opportunities for innovation and policy enhancement to foster sustainable development. Key recommendations include intensifying educational programs to elevate public understanding and engagement, formulating supportive policies that facilitate CE adoption, and promoting intersectoral collaboration to leverage collective expertise and resources. Additionally, the research underscores the necessity of integrating CE principles into urban planning and policy frameworks to effectively address specific local challenges such as waste management, pollution, and urban sprawl. By providing a detailed analysis of the current state and potential of CE in Mexico, this paper contributes valuable insights to the global discourse on sustainability. It proposes strategic actions to overcome existing hurdles and capitalize on opportunities within the CE framework, charting a path forward for Mexico and serving as a model for other regions facing similar sustainability challenges",Not About Sufficiency
Land Cover Implications on Ecosystem Service Delivery: a Multi-Scenario Study of Trade-offs and Synergies in River Basins,"Land cover change scenarios hold far-reaching implications for ecosystem services (ES), highlighting the need for understanding the trade-offs and synergies underlying the provision of multiple ES. The insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms governing the relationships among multiple ES, along with the lack of information on trade-offs among ES under different scenarios, restricts the ability to provide effective information for decision-makers. To fill this gap, we assessed the interplay among six ES: climate regulation, habitat creating and maintaining species diversity, cultivated crops, regulation of the chemical condition of freshwaters by living processes (water quality), water yield, and control of erosion rates, within three river basins in northwest Portugal. We employed the InVEST to map the state of these ES in 2018, along with three projected land cover scenarios for 2050: business-as-usual, farmland return, and afforestation. Our findings indicated the business-as-usual scenario could lead to detrimental impacts on climate regulation, habitat creating and maintaining species diversity, and control of erosion rates. In contrast, the farmland return scenario showed less drastic decreases in habitat-creating and maintaining species diversity and control of erosion rates compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Afforestation emerged as the most favorable scenario, with a 13.6% increase in climate regulation and a 1.3% improvement in habitat-creating and maintaining species diversity. Cluster analysis allowed the identification of six levels of spatial synergies between ES, with regions of high forest cover showing extreme synergy and populated areas exhibiting the lowest levels of synergy, suggesting that a well-planned combination of these practices could yield substantial benefits for future ES provision. These results provide crucial insights for decision-makers to enhance ecosystem management and promote societal well-being. Importantly, our findings underscore the significance of considering multiple ES and their interrelationships in land use planning to achieve sustainable development objectives.",Not About Sufficiency

A health financing policy agenda for climate mitigation and adaptation,"The international community increasingly acknowledges the contribution of health systems to climate change and environmental degradation: globally, the health sector contributed approximately 5% to greenhouse gas emissions in 2019.1 This contribution is mainly due to energy-intensive production and transportation of supplies such as drugs, commodities and equipment, as well as energy consumption within health facilities and waste treatment.2 Conversely, climate change, pollution and related consequences, including psychological stress, also affect human health in numerous ways. Among others, higher temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns lead to prolonged droughts or floodings as well as higher transmission rates of vector-borne and waterborne diseases, increasing healthcare needs and often leading to increased out-of-pocket health expenditure.3 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2030, the additional direct costs for the health sector alone will be 2-4 billion United States dollars (US$) per year globally.2Climate change also has implications for health financing. The way health financing policies are designed can contribute to mitigation. Mitigation measures are actions that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - thus tackling the main cause of climate change. At the same time, various health financing arrangements need to be adapted to address the rising health needs and expenditure. Some of these adaptations also support the necessary changes to make the health system resilient. Adaptation measures serve to adjust to actual or expected climate change and its effects, and to reduce vulnerability.Sparse documentation is available on how climate financing is (or can be) used for the health sector.4 The recent WHO Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems2 covers financing for climate change and health interventions. Here, we link to this WHO work and delve further into the health financing functions, that is, revenue raising, pooling and purchasing (Box 1). This paper is geared towards health financing policy-makers. To contribute to the conceptualization, awareness raising and agenda setting of the role of health financing, this article provides an initial overview of policy options for mitigation and adaptation measures within health financing that national or subnational governments could and/or already apply, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries. Finally, we identify some key questions that can help advance the policy and research agenda for health financing to support climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems. We emphasize that such health financing policy measures are only one part of the overall government and societal response, and need to be closely aligned with wider government action.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimal decisions for competitive manufacturers under carbon tax and cap-and-trade policies,"With the gradual increasing of deepening of people's understanding of sustainable development, governments and enterprises have come to attach great importance to carbon emissions. Cap-and-trade (C&T) and carbon tax policies are widely regarded as two effective mechanisms for reducing carbon emissions. In this paper, considering consumer environmental awareness (CEA), we study the carbon emission reduction (CER) of two competitive manufacturers given the carbon tax and C&T policies. The two manufactures have two competitive behaviors: Cournot and Collusion. Four models are respectively constructed for different behaviors and policies, and the optimal decisions are obtained. Furthermore, comparison of the optimal solutions and parametric sensitivity analysis are discussed under two scenarios. The results indicate that the C&T policy is more sensitive to CEA than is the carbon tax policy. When manufacturers improve the efficiency of CER, compared with carbon tax policy, the C&T policy can more effectively curb carbon emissions, improve social welfare, and enhance the competitiveness of manufacturers. The fiercer CER competition leads to lower emissions and social welfare but higher total carbon emissions. The manufacturers' collusion behavior cannot make them achieve a win-win situation.",Not About Sufficiency

"Operative System for Strategic Sustainable Development-Coordinating Analysis, Planning, Action, and Use of Supports Such as the Sustainable Development Goals, Planetary Boundaries, Circular Economy, and Science-Based Targets","The number of sustainability supports keeps growing. However, they are typically not capable of bridging planetary-to-organizational scales and therefore in themselves provide limited guidance for how organizations can contribute strategically to global sustainability. This is severe since the power of change that organizations represent is essential for humanity to succeed with the transition to sustainability. Furthermore, a specific sustainability support typically lacks a clear description of what gap it is designed to fill. This may add confusion to an already complex area and can result in organizations selecting supports that are not the most appropriate for the organization's purpose and transition plan. The aim of this study was therefore to prototype an approach for SWOT analyses of sustainability supports and for guiding effective and coordinated use of them. We tested the approach for some examples of supports that are currently receiving much attention: the sustainable development goals, planetary boundaries, circular economy, and science-based targets. We argue that the tested approach can be generalized and makes it possible to clarify limitations and value of any support from a systemic, systematic, and strategic sustainability perspective and, therefore, also to clarify how the supports relate to each other and can be selected and used in an effective and coordinated way.

OPAL: An open-source software tool for integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services into impact assessment and mitigation decisions,"Governments and financial institutions increasingly require that environmental impact assessment and mitigation account for consequences to both biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here we present a new software tool, OPAL (Offset Portfolio Analyzer and Locator), which maps and quantifies the impacts of development on habitat and ecosystem services, and facilitates the selection of mitigation activities to offset losses. We demonstrate its application with an oil and gas extraction facility in Colombia. OPAL is the first tool to provide direct consideration of the distribution of ecosystem service benefits among people in a mitigation context. Previous biodiversity-focused efforts led to redistribution or loss of ecosystem services with environmental justice implications. Joint consideration of biodiversity and ecosystem services enables targeting of offsets to benefit both nature and society. OPAL reduces the time and technical expertise required for these analyses and has the flexibility to be used across a range of geographic and policy contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, they can strengthen the three pillars of sustainable development: the economy, by boosting productivity; social welfare, by improving living standards and enhancing safety and security; and the environment, by reducing indoor and outdoor pollution and remediating environmental degradation. Many factors that need to be considered and appropriately addressed in moving towards energy sustainability in Nigeria are examined in this article. These include full exploitation and promotion of renewable energy resources and application of energy conservation measures in various sectors such as manufacturing industrial set-up, office and residential buildings and transportation.

Social Aspects of Electric Vehicles Research—Trends and Relations to Sustainable Development Goals,"E-mobility sustainability assessment is becoming more comprehensive with research integrating social aspects without focusing only on technical, economic, and/or environmental perspectives. The transportation sector is indeed one of the leading and most challenging greenhouse gas polluters, and e-mobility is seen as one of the potential solutions; however, a social perspective must be further investigated to improve the perception of and acceptance of electric vehicles. This could consequently lead to the European Green Deal’s holy grail: faster decarbonization of the transportation sector. Another way to achieve it is by promoting more comprehensive sustainable development goals. Therefore, this paper combines a systematic review of recent research with research emphasis focused on social aspects of electric vehicles and their interconnection with specific UN Sustainable Development Goals. By knowing the current research focus mainly related with “perception” of electric vehicles and assessing their social “impact” as well as an emerging area of “user experience” and their relations with UN Sustainable Development Goals enables better insight on the current and future directions of electric vehicle social sustainability research. The current priority is identified as “climate actions”. Increasingly important “sustainable cities and communities” shows potential for becoming one of the future research, policy, and community priorities.",Not About Sufficiency
"Dynamics of land use and land cover changes in Huluka watershed of Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia","BackgroundLand use and land cover changes in urbanized watersheds of developing countries like Ethiopia are underpinned by the complex interaction of different actors, driving forces, and the land itself. Land conversion due to residential development, economic growth, and transportation is identified as the most serious environmental pressure on urbanized landscapes of the world. It results in the degradation of natural vegetation and significant increases in impervious surfaces. The purpose of the study was to analyze spatio-teporal changes in land use and land cover in the Huluka watershed with implications to sustainable development in the watershed.ResultsForest land, cultivated land, urban built-up, bush/shrub land, bare land, grassland, and water body were identified as the seven types of land use and land cover in the Huluka watershed. Forest land decreased by 59.3% at an average rate of 164.52 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Bush/ shrub land decreased by 68.2% at an average rate of 318.71 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Grassland decreased by 32.7% at an average rate of 228.65 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Water body decreased by 5.1% at an average rate of 1.06 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Urban built-up area increased by 351% at an average rate of 16.20 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Cultivated land increased by 105.3% at an average rate of 692.76 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Bare land increased by 41.9% at an average rate of 4.00 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Infrastructural and agricultural expansion, increased demand for wood, local environmental and biophysical drivers, rapid human population growth, economic drivers, technological drivers, policy and institutional drivers, and local socio-cultural drivers were perceived by residents as drivers of land use and land cover changes. Increased flooding risk, increased soil erosion, increased sedimentation into water resources like lakes and rivers, decrease in soil fertility, loss of biodiversity, loss of springs, decrease in annual rainfall, and increase in heat during the dry season were perceived by residents as negative local effects of land use and land cover changes.ConclusionsChanges in land use and land cover in the study water shade imply the need for integrating sustainable watershed planning and management into natural resources management strategies. In other words, practices of appropriate land use planning and management, family planning, participatory planning and management, appropriate environmental impact assessment (EIA), and proper planning and management of development projects and programmes are of paramount importance to promote sustainable development in the Huluka watershed and beyond.",Not About Sufficiency
"Of renewable energy, energy democracy, and sustainable development: A roadmap to accelerate the energy transition in developing countries","The world faces two pressing challenges: on the one hand, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C; on the other hand, enabling socio-economic development that is inclusive and equitable. These two challenges should not be seen as conflicting and should be addressed simultaneously. This is particularly true as we look forward to a post-COVID recovery efforts. The solution may partially rest on the transition to sustainable and renewable energy systems. The energy transition comprises presumptions of energy efficiency, affordability, reliability, and energy independence. And in developing countries, in particular, it also entails expectations of economic development, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. Since most of the remaining renewable energy potential lies in developing countries, these countries will play a crucial role. This paper reviews the status of the energy transition in the Global South, by surveying scientific and grey literature and synthesising the wide scope of alternatives available to accelerate and enhance the transition to renewable energy systems. The alternatives and approaches found are encapsulated in three dimensions: technology, society, and policy. A roadmap presents the potential synergies that could be established across dimensions and sectors to aid the energy transition in developing countries. Concisely, the transition can be achieved by adopting and implementing technologies already commercially-available that improve the efficiency, affordability, and reliability of energy systems, by redefining and reclaiming citizens' participation in energy planning and policy-making, and by democratically restructuring institutions and monitoring to boost transparency, accountability, and trust.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impacts of Small-Scale Gold Mining on Food Security in Ghana,"Small-scale gold mining has expanded in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world including Peru and the Philippines, over the last two decades. Numerous factors, including rising gold prices, agricultural poverty, and administrative difficulties, have been cited as explanations for the rapid growth. The rapid growth of small-scale gold mining has a plethora of implications for agriculture, particularly smallholder farming. This is because the primary resource (land) on which mining, and agriculture are based is scarce, and mineral deposits frequently coincide with land suitable for agriculture. Additionally, mining and agriculture both consume large amounts of water and are labour intensive. Thus, a direct link between the expansion of small-scale gold mining and its impact on smallholder agriculture has been established in various countries throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, though opinions vary on whether the relationship is complementary or competitive. Additionally, the impacts of these connections on food security have received relatively little attention, and they are heavily underrepresented in the literatures on small-scale mining and food security. This thesis closes this knowledge gap by shedding light on the impact of small-scale gold mining on food security and contributing to the debate over the relationship between small-scale gold mining and smallholder farming. I argue, using a mixed method case study in Ghana, that mining has a negative impact on food security and that women and children bear a disproportionate share of the burden. Additionally, I demonstrated how competitive and conflict-ridden the relationship between small-scale mining and smallholder farming is.This study was guided by a novel synthesis of the capability approach and a political ecology perspective. I begin by examining how structural and economic reforms have influenced mining and agricultural activities in Ghana over time, as well as the consequences of these reforms, with a particular emphasis on the often-overlooked ecological footprints. Second, I quantify and predict the pattern of land use and land cover change that would occur under various scenarios, as well as the factors that would cause these changes. Thirdly, I examine the factors affecting miners and smallholder farmers' access to critical resources (land, water, and labour), as well as the key actors in the mining and smallholder farming subsectors, as well as their power hierarchy and relationship. Finally, I examine the relationships between mining and smallholder farming and the state of individual food security (availability, access, utilisation, and stability).The key findings are as follows: first, that the promotion of export-oriented commodities such as gold and cash crops such as cocoa and oil palm at the expense of peasant farmers' food crops is associated with severe ecological impacts that remain shielded in the absence of required environmental legislation until they exacerbate. There are also flashpoints of conflict between mining and smallholder farming, which has been aggravated by recent reforms and lays the groundwork for future conflicts. Second, four distinct periods of land use and land cover dynamics for mining footprints were identified using a combination of social science and geospatial methods: periods of none to limited increase, gradual to accelerated increase, sharp increase, and gradual decrease in mining footprints. These land use and land cover dynamics were found to be associated with three major ecological impacts of mining: land degradation, deforestation, and water pollution. Over a 34-year period, a total of 27,333 ha (36% of forest cover) was lost, along with severe land degradation and water pollution. If mining activities continue at their current pace, the study predicts increased ecological impacts. Third, the previously coexisting mining and smallholder farming subsectors are now fiercely competing for access to critical resources (land, labour, and water), a situation shaped by unequal power relations between the two subsectors' key actors. Finally, small-scale gold mining significantly contributes to food insecurity and, as a result, to the poor health and well-being of many people, particularly women and children. Half of the study participants experienced moderate food insecurity, while 13% experienced severe food insecurity. Additionally, 79% of women of reproductive age (15 to 49) were unable to meet the Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD) requirements, a measure of micronutrient adequacy and, thus, food quality. Furthermore, local challenges with food availability, as well as associated challenges with food access and utilisation, erode food stability over time, forcing more people to adopt alternative coping strategies.The findings of this study provide novel empirical evidence on the impacts of small-scale gold mining on food security and highlight the importance of integrating mixed and geospatial methods. Additionally, the findings demonstrate the value of combining political ecology and capability approaches in natural resource governance and food security research.",Not About Sufficiency
Nudging and boosting for equity? Towards a behavioural economics of energy justice,"With climate mitigation and energy transition impacts on vulnerable individuals becoming increasingly evident, justice considerations take on heightened relevance for energy governance. Yet, energy justice remains under-investigated in relation to the potential of behavioural economics. Behavioural economics provides evidence that individuals exhibit systematic and predictable patterns of decision-making that depart from the assumptions of rational choice theory, thus giving policy-makers a richer model of human behaviour. Adopting such a model will impact energy justice outcomes, hence understanding potential dynamics is timely. How can policy-makers complement traditional energy poverty alleviation measures with behaviourally informed ones to enhance vulnerable individuals' cognitive capacity? What implications does this carry for energy justice? Supportive choice architecture for individuals exposed to higher risks related to energy access and use must improve their outcomes, without shifting the responsibility for vulnerability to them, neglecting their intrinsic capabilities, or obscuring structural injustice. This article analytically illustrates whether and how behavioural economics can support individual behaviour and promote collective action, in combination with a policy shift to substantive claim-making processes, to address the unfair distribution of energy use burdens. Using nudging and boosting as tools for energy poverty alleviation, it discusses how behavioural economics can enhance energy justice.",Not About Sufficiency
No Sustainable Development in the Lack of Environmental Justice,"Environmental justice is defined in a broader sense as, ""The fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies."" In view of this definition, it is fair to say that no nation can achieve sustainable development if it lacks environmental justice. Sustainability or sustainable development is defined as, ""The development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs."" Accordingly, it is really difficult to maintain sustainable development without having environmental justice. The acts of many governments (particularly those of industrial countries) have, unfortunately, resulted in poisoning of communities and lands, and in genocides of peoples and the environment. As we are concerned here with the environmental status in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), it is important to focus on the injustices and oppressions practiced by the state of Israel and its successive governments, army, settlers, and industries against the environment in Palestine. This article sheds light on the issues of environmental justice (injustice) and sustainable (unsustainable) development in the OPT, in view of the Israeli violations of international law and international treaties, as well as the local and regional agreements related to the environment. Israel, since it occupied the Palestinian territories in June 1967, has committed what is believed to be racism and genocide against the environment and its constituents (land, soil, water, air, and biodiversity). In view of the above, certain principles of environmental justice should be universally affirmed and adopted, taking into account the tremendous violations of the Israeli authorities against the environment in the OPT, in particular, and in Historic Palestine, in general.",Not About Sufficiency
"Effect of the brown shrimp Crangon crangon L. on endobenthic macrofauna, meiofauna and meiofaunal grazing rates","The effect of natural densities (50 and 100 ind·m-2) of juvenile (<20 mm) Crangon crangon on abundance of endobenthic macrofauna and meiofauna and on meiofaunal grazing rates was investigated in two experiments using an outdoor flow-through system with sandy sediment. The experiments differed in duration (3 wk and 7.5 wk), and in time of the year (August - September and July - August). Macrofaunal biomass differed by a factor of 10 between the experiments, and was depressed by shrimp in both experiments. Neither total meiofaunal biomass, nor the biomass of the dominant taxon (nematodes), was significantly affected by the presence of Crangon in the shorter experiment. However, harpacticoid copepods and other meiofauna taxa (mainly ostracods, foraminiferans and juvenile bivalves) decreased in the presence of Crangon. In the longer experiment, no significant effect of Crangon on meiofauna was seen, and the biomass of most meiofaunal groups increased in all treatments. Meiofaunal grazing rates in microalgae and bacteria, measured with a dual-labelling method, using 14C-bicarbonate and [methyl-3]]-thymidine as tracers, were 0.7 to 4.7% of algal biomass per day, and 0.8 to 7.9% of bacterial biomass per day. Generally, grazing rates were lower in the presence than in the absence of Crangon. In terms of carbon ingested, microalgae constituted a more important food source than bacteria for all three meiofaunal groups (nematodes, harpacticoids and other meiofauna). No individual growth of Crangon was found in the high-density treatment in the longer experiment, suggesting that intraspecific competition occurred. The difference between the two experiments in the effect of Crangon on meiofauna is thought to be caused by the large difference in macrofaunal biomass between the experiments; the shrimp ate mainly juvenile macrofauna in the longer experiment. Overall, the effect of Crangon on the sediment system was weak, suggesting that other factors (physical and chemical) are more important than epibenthic predation in setting the overall limits for production in this sediment. © 1993.",Not About Sufficiency
Agrivoltaics: Integration of Reused PV Modules,"This study evaluates the integration of reused PV modules within an agrivoltaic system designed for sustainable horticultural production, focusing on energy performance and agricultural outcomes. The experimental setup included both new and partially repaired PV modules, installed over tomato crops under real operating conditions. The results demonstrate that reused PV modules exhibit a strong and consistent energy performance, achieving correlations between irradiance and energy output comparable to new panels. Despite slightly lower performance ratios, reused modules maintained stable efficiency and operational viability, emphasizing their potential for sustainable applications. On the agricultural side, shading provided by PV panels protects the crop yield. This study highlights the environmental and economic advantages of incorporating reused PV modules into agrivoltaic systems, including reductions in raw material extraction, electronic waste generation, and overall environmental impact. By leveraging the circular economy principles, agrivoltaics with reused PV modules provide a sustainable pathway to balance energy production and food security while optimizing land use efficiency. These findings establish the potential of agrivoltaics as a key technology in advancing the sustainable energy transition.",Not About Sufficiency
Rural land systems both support and hinder the Sustainable Development Goals across Europe,"Achieving sustainable rural land systems, including farms and forestry, is essential to achieve the European Union’s goal of fair and healthy food systems while becoming climate-neutral and halting biodiversity loss. Here we quantitatively assess the environmental and socioeconomic sustainability of rural land systems in Europe using spatial hotspot analyses based on 15 environmental and 9 social sustainability indicators from the European Sustainable Development Goals and the Common Agricultural Policy. We find high subsidy support for under-performing sustainability areas and low sustainability performance in areas producing the most calories. However, we identified two brightspots with good environmental and socioeconomic performance (Nordics and Central Europe), and five dragspots hindering sustainability: the Balkans, the Lowlands, Northern Italy, Southern Italy and Malta, and Southern Spain. Redirecting support to reward social and environmental benefits from land use can help achieve sustainability goals.European agricultural subsidies are mainly allocated to rural regions where agriculture is intensified such as southern Europe, the Lowlands, and the Balkans, instead of Nordic and Central Europe which are more sustainable, according to a spatial hotspot analysis of 24 sustainability indicators",Not About Sufficiency
Nexus and synergy between the low-carbon economy and circular economy: A systematic and critical review,"The circular economy and low-carbon economy are closely interconnected as pillars of global sustainable development. However, no consensus exists on how to maximize the carbon reduction benefits of circular practices. This paper illustrates the nexus and identifies synergy paths between low-carbon actions and circular practices via a systematic and critical review. Results show that the mutual promotion relationship is the most studied in the existing literature (63.48%), followed by the parallel status (38.20%) and the trade-offs (3.37%). To enhance synergy mechanisms such as urban-industrial symbiosis and critical raw material cycles, challenges related to cost/risk reduction, urban/industrial planning and inter-system barriers should be addressed. Potential trade-offs arise mainly from carbon-intensive electricity, circular economy rebound and raw material scarcity, requiring a comprehensive consideration of the territorial energy supply structure and circular economy chains. Fiscal and informational interventions from the government, and the technological and business innovations they foster, are the shared drivers. Low-carbon actions and circular practices work together to serve the sustainable development of entities under various scales and dimensions. Three principles are proposed for decision-makers to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs: (1) prioritize non-end-of-life strategies to meet the surging de-mand for critical raw materials in the short term, (2) adjust the mix of circular practices following the pace of low-carbon energy transition, and (3) implement more bio-projects that contribute to a win-win situation for the transition to renewable energy and integrated bio-waste management. Briefly, circular practices reduce carbon emissions more effectively when tailored to local and immediate conditions. Future research should focus more on the time-varying features of different circular practices, factors behind household and individual behaviors, and social sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency

Findings highlight that while local wisdom-based practices like “Tri Hita Karana” and customary land-use regulations are effective in mitigating environmental damage, scaling these approaches across diverse communities remains a challenge. Additionally, law enforcement against forest burning, coupled with traditional restorative justice, has shown promise in reducing environmental degradation. This review identifies significant gaps in policy integration, particularly in aligning local wisdom with national climate goals.

Necessary or oversimplification? On the strengths and limitations of current assessments to integrate social dimensions in planetary boundaries,"With the Earth system being about to leave Holocene conditions and thus the known safe operating space for humanity, frameworks such as the Planetary Boundaries (PBs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide quantitative metrics to guide sustainability transformations. In order to strive, not only for compliance with the PBs but also for societal well-being, some approaches attempt to combine both PBs and SDGs within a single assessment. We focus on two prominent examples, the ""Doughnut"" by Kate Raworth and the #SDGinPB project of the 2018 report to the Club of Rome, which are not only aimed at public outreach, but also at guiding policy-making. To meet these objectives, the approaches should possess a certain accuracy in determining the progress in achieving the SDGs and in complying with the PBs. We evaluate, by using a multi-indicator approach for comparison, whether both approaches' limited set of indicators can still represent the SDGs' complexity. This comparative approach estimates the progress in achieving SDGs, especially in the Global North, to be significantly lower. Based on these results and against the approaches' purposes, we discuss their simplifications and at which point the results are no longer reliable. We conclude that global assessments can be an important factor in initiating transformative processes by stimulating public discourse, but that the actual implementation of these would require approaches with greater recognition of local particularities.",Not About Sufficiency
National-level consumption-based and production-based utilisation of the land-system change planetary boundary: patterns and trends,"To achieve responsible consumption and production under UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12, national agri-food consumption and production need to be assessed against environmental limits. We downscaled the land-system change planetary boundary and allocated national-scale cropland environmental limits for agri-food consumption via fair-share allocation based on population, and for agri-food production via biophysical allocation based on available arable land. We assessed country-level utilisation of the land-system change planetary boundary via quantifying national cropland footprints (including imports/exports) using an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output model. Consumption-based footprints were assessed against fair-share cropland limits and production-based footprints were assessed against biophysical cropland limits. Most countries' agri-food consumption footprints exceeded their fair-share cropland limit while production utilisation of biophysical limits was less pronounced. Conversely, China and India's cropland consumption footprints were safely within their fair-share environmental limits (utilisation percentages of 80% and 74%, respectively), while their cropland production footprints exceeded biophysical limits (utilisation percentages of 132% and 165%, respectively). Assessing country-level utilisation of the environmental limit for cropland can provide a basis for countries to act as individual entities, or collectively, to develop policies that mitigate their global cropland demand and minimise the risks associated with the exceedance of the land-system change planetary boundary.",Not About Sufficiency
Role of organic amendments in improving physiological and yield parameters of okra grown under saline conditions,"Purpose: Salinity is a devastating abiotic stress that poses serious risks to agricultural sustainability and global food security. The yield of okra [Abelmoschusesculentus (L.) Moench] is adversely affected by salinity stress. The research was conducted to evaluate the effects of organic amendments on the physiological and yield parameters of okra plants under saline conditions.Method: In a pot experiment, okra plants were grown in non-saline and saline (50 mM sodium chloride) soil supplemented with municipal solid waste compost, farmyard manure (FYM), and press mud, each applied individually or in various combinations (Compost + FYM, FYM + Press mud and Compost + Press mud).Results: Salinity stress significantly reduced relative water content, membrane stability index, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, photosynthetic rate, fruit length, fruit diameter, no. of fruits per plant, fruit fresh weight, fruit dry weight, fruit yield per plant, no. of seeds per pod and 100 seeds weight of okra plants, compared to control. Under saline conditions, 5% (FYM + Press mud) was the most effective treatment in significantly improving stomatal conductance, intercellular carbon dioxide concentration, no. of fruits per plant, fruit dry weight, and fruit yield per plant of okra, compared to saline soil.Conclusion: Application of 5% (FYM + Press mud) could improve the physiological and yield parameters of okra grown in saline soil (50 mM Sodium chloride) by mitigating adverse effects of salinity and could be used as a cost-effective and bio-rationale approach for alleviation of salinity stress in crops to attain agricultural sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring the Presence and Absence of Academic Discourse on Public Participation in the European Green Deal: A Central and Eastern European Perspective,"The European Green Deal (EGD), a complex policy program meant to address climate change and ensure a “just, fair and inclusive” transition into a more sustainable and greener Europe, was launched by the EU in 2019. It was clear from the very beginning that the opportunities and costs of the ambitious green transition would be very uneven geographically, not only within the EU but also among its regions and locations. Regions with higher environmental stress and/or less technological and economic capacities will inevitably be disadvantaged. The EGD requires large-scale public acceptance, which comes with democratic innovations and participative practices, which are less embedded in many regions. The former socialist bloc still struggles today with establishing decent levels of public participation, as well as with adopting and implementing democratic community principles in practice. The main aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we intend to give an assessment of where Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries stand in the process of the green transition and what the major focus areas affecting them are, based on the existing academic literature. On the other hand, we intend to give a clear overview of the causes for and aspects of the weakness of civil society in the post-communist bloc and reasons why the adaptation of democratic innovations is lagging in this region. For this purpose, a systematic literature search and bibliometric analysis was performed based on articles indexed in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Altogether, 172 articles published in the region were filtered and systematically analyzed according to the main themes of the papers related to the EGD. Research findings show that the interests of researchers in CEE countries largely differ from those in the mainstream academic discourse. Research topics, high on the agenda in Western countries, are hardly present in the academic discourse in CEE countries. On the other hand, issues like energy efficiency, urbanization’s impacts on green growth and renewable energy development, and innovations towards a circular economy dominate the research agenda. This region started the green transition process with major handicaps compared to the West, connected to path dependency and the legacy of socialist structures. The paper analyses the bibliometric aspects of articles published on these topics and highlights the highly sectoral and country-focused approaches taken with regard to the EGD. In our paper, we highlight the importance of the region on a geographic scale, which goes beyond the initial framework and offers a different approach to addressing the issue. The paper proves that the presence of EGD-related participation processes is significantly lacking in academic literature in the CEE region. However, the most important finding of our paper is the identification of an academic gap regarding democratic innovations and deliberation, as well as regarding active involvement and participation of people in EGD-related programs. This gives an even more important base for the assessment of the region in terms of the EGD, which faces growing populism and advancing authoritarian regimes, such that public participation and citizen control have become vitally important for the implementation of the green transition.",Not About Sufficiency
Evolving Roles for International Social Work in Addressing Climate Change,"Global warming and ozone layer depletion signal the onset of climate change, a “slow-onset” disaster exacerbating poverty and social inequality. Addressing this requires global cooperation, as exemplified by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 13, which focuses on climate action.

Social workers play a crucial role in climate change adaptation, engaging in community resilience, advocacy, and policy influence. Their work spans individual counseling, social protection, and addressing environmental refugee crises. As climate change impacts intensify, social workers must expand their roles internationally, advocating for human rights, social justice, and disaster risk reduction. Human rights frameworks guide social workers in addressing climate-related health and social inequalities, emphasizing empowerment and equity.

The question of women and environment in the Sudan: inquiries into eco-feminism and feminist environmentalism.,"This article discusses a theoretical framework suggested by Agarwal on eco-feminism in the context of Sudan and the Kordofam region of Sudan. The paper focuses specifically on one aspect of eco-feminism that is discussed by Shiva (1988). Eco-feminism is the link between the domination and suppression of women and the domination and exploitation of nature. Women are identified with nature, while men are closer to culture, which places women in an inferior position. Because of the link of women with nature, women have a vested interest in restructuring the domination of nature. Feminism and environmentalism both reflect egalitarian and nonhierarchical systems. This analysis tests whether women are the central actors of environment and whether women's and environmental interests can be advanced simultaneously. The Indian experience reflects the class and gender process that results in loss of knowledge and livelihoods among poor rural women. The impact is related to the interaction between ideology and political and economic power. Grass-roots resistance to environmental degradation is strong, and women are engaged due to threats to survival. Sudanese women's role, position, status, and relation to the environment is shaped by the patriarchal order, class, ethnicity, and the sexual division of labor. The Shiva concepts apply to Sudan and the Kordofan region. The marginalization of traditional farming and pastoralism has pushed the growing population into marginal environmental zones. The focus on cash-oriented development, political instability, and insufficient and corrupt bureaucracies have aggravated the environmental crisis. Social inequality has increased. Shiva's theories do not fit Sudanese society and Agarwal's perspective is too general. Some Sudanese women have accumulated wealth, commercial interests, and exploited land.",Not About Sufficiency
The economics of complex humanitarian emergencies: preliminary approaches and findings,"This paper, a draft from the early stages of an ongoing UNU/WIDER research project, outlines hypotheses for the economic cause of humanitarian disasters. Complex humanitarian emergencies are considered to be man-made crises, in which large numbers of people die and suffer from war, physical violence, disease, hunger, or displacement. The study identifies four sets of economic factors responsible for emergencies: stagnation and protracted decline in incomes, unequal of immiserizing growth, rapid population growth during substantial environmental degradation and resource depletion, and large and abrupt shifts in income and wealth distribution during adjustment and liberalization programmes. The strategies of elites to maintain or expand power and benefits, in the midst of adverse economic changes and mass reaction to these changes, are instrumental in determining the potential for humanitarian disasters. A goal of the paper is to discuss, in a preliminary way, cases that fit an economic model of the causes of emergencies, setting the stage for further case studies to test how much we can generalize on the hypotheses and examples from this paper.",Not About Sufficiency
Modelling the impact of past and future land-use changes on land cover degradation at territorial level in Eastern DR Congo,"Land use and land cover (LULC) changes are recognized as drivers of environmental changes at the local, regional, and global levels. Detecting these changes is essential in developing land management plans and strategies. More particularly, the LULC changes constitute one of the sub-indicators used for setting the baseline for land degradation neutrality (LDN) planning and assessing the progress toward the sustainable development goal 15.3. This study aims to determine the implication of LULC dynamics on land cover degradation in Eastern DR Congo. This region has been subjected to uncontrolled LULC changes over the last three decades but the impact of these changes on land degradation has not been assessed yet at the territorial level. To fill this gap, the territory of Kalehe has been used as a case study to monitor the LULC changes during the 1987–2020 period based on the classification of Landsat images, to forecast the future LULC for the 2030–2070 period through the hybrid Markov-Support Vector Machine modeling, to determine the extent of land cover degradation associated with these changes and to assess the impact of biophysical and socio-economic factors on the occurrence of land cover degradation using the binary logistic regression model. The results reveal that the overall trends of LULC changes during the 1987–2020 period are the increasing of built-up area, shrubland, and cropland at the expense of forestland, wetland, and grassland. This situation is expected to continue in the future and contribute to the degradation of land cover within the study area. Under the current situation of LULC changes, 34.17% of the land has been subjected to potential degradation. Furthermore, under the business-as-usual scenario 28.28%, 27.28%, and 33.65% of the land will be degraded by 2030, 2050, and 2070 respectively. This land cover degradation is more likely to occur in the proximity of roads, localities, highly populated areas, mining concessions, and high-altitudinal zones. Since the current land use system is unsustainable, there is a necessity to implement sustainable land management strategies that take into account the biophysical and socio-economic specificities of this region to reverse the problem of land cover degradation.",Not About Sufficiency
Performance Analysis of a Conventional and Renewable Energy based Electric Power Generation Systems – A Comparative LCA Study,"Electricity, a readily usable form of energy is much in demand in developing countries like India due to the increase in human population and their improved lifestyles.

It is a common knowledge that renewable systems have better energy efficiency as they do not consume fuel energy as input and also have lower carbon emissions. This study projects what extent they are better for a unit of electricity produced by both competing systems in terms of predefined metrics such as ERR/EPBT, GWP and GWMP in terms of CO2 equivalents and Green Rating for comparative purposes. The study results may be useful for policymakers as a component in the comprehensive decision-making process for energy planning to meet the future human need or greed for electricity with sustainability and also to achieve circular economy goals.",Not About Sufficiency
The Cairo crunch.,"The emphasis on excessive population growth in developing countries has diverted attention from the equally significant issue of excessive consumption in developed countries. For example, the rich nations, which contain only 22% of the world's population, cause 74-87% of major pollutants and consume 76-92% of global natural resources each year. While the world's wealthiest 1 billion people have doubled their consumption of meat, energy, steel, copper, and timber since 1950, there has been no increase among the poorest 1 billion. The worldwide value of luxury goods is equivalent to two-thirds of the gross national products of all Third World countries. Although the mass media's introduction into the Third World has raised the aspirations of the world's poor, stores of nonrenewable raw materials would be depleted within a decade if the standard of living were to be equalized. Even if per capita consumption worldwide declines to 2% per year from its current level of 3%, the sustainable capacity of the Earth is in jeopardy. The threat to the continued ability of the planet to sustain life and to the dignity of the have-nots could be ameliorated by a combination of measures, including zero population growth in developed countries, increased foreign aid to population programs in the Third World, production of goods that require fewer raw materials and generate less pollution, and reduced consumption in the North.",Not About Sufficiency
Public support and willingness to pay for a carbon tax in Hungary: can revenue recycling make a difference?,"BackgroundTo curb human-made carbon-dioxide emissions, the European Union will introduce carbon pricing for buildings and transport in 2027. Central and East European (CEE) countries are pressured to embark on ambitious decarbonization pathways leading to carbon-neutral economies by 2050. This paper is the first to investigate the public acceptance of and the willingness to pay (WTP) for a carbon tax in a CEE country, Hungary. It analyzes the support-increasing effects of five revenue-recycling mechanisms (tax cuts, green spending, support for poor households, funding for health care and education, and debt reduction), a wider range than covered in previous studies. A national face-to-face survey of 3013 adults on public attitudes to climate change, conducted in summer 2022, is the main method of data collection. This is combined with secondary analysis of related statistics and documentary analysis of relevant materials.ResultsThe results show low public acceptance, with only a modest increase from 20.3% to 27.3% due to revenue recycling. This is accompanied by low WTP values and WTP increases. All these are lower than those found in Western surveys. A novel empirical result is the relative popularity of public health care and education in revenue recycling, though differences in revenue-recycling preferences are apparent between those who accept a carbon tax even without a redistribution mechanism and those who are willing to pay only if redistribution is included. Green spending also performed relatively well, while supporting the poor fared less well, albeit with relatively high WTP values. Reducing taxes and public debt were the least likely to instigate carbon-tax acceptance.ConclusionsThe results highlight the importance of carefully assessing the distributional impact of implementing carbon pricing mechanisms and thoroughly integrating social considerations into climate policy. Based on this, as well as the analysis of the social conditions and political economy of climate policy development in Hungary, policies—such as a gradually increasing carbon tax, social cushioning, legal earmarking of carbon-tax revenues, and policy bundling—are proposed to make carbon pricing socially tolerable and politically acceptable. The findings and conclusions might also be relevant for other parts of the CEE region.",Not About Sufficiency
Modeling future land use and land cover under different scenarios using patch-generating land use simulation model. A case study of Ndola district,"Accurate predictions of changes in Land-use and Land-cover (LULC) are crucial in climate modeling, providing valuable insights into the possible effects of land-use alterations on Earth's intricate system. This study focuses on forecasting and examining future LULC changes in the Ndola district from 2022 to 2042, considering three scenarios: Traditional mode (TM), Ecological Preservation (EP), and Economic Development (ED). TM reflects past land use changes, EP prioritizes environmental conservation, and ED emphasizes economic growth and urbanization. Using the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model, we achieved precise predictions of LULC changes in Ndola district. The model, which combines LEAS rule-extraction with a CA model using CARS, addresses limitations of previous models like CLUE-S, CA-Markov, and FLUS by accurately simulating scattered LULC patterns and the mutual attraction and evolution of open space and urban land under different policies. Using LULC data from the livingatlas platform for the base period (2017–2022), the model demonstrated a Kappa coefficient of 78% and a FoM value of 0.34. Key findings indicate significant trends, such as reductions in forest and agricultural lands in the TM and ED scenarios, with rangeland expanding consistently across all scenarios, particularly in the ED scenario. The decline in agricultural and forest lands raises concerns about household food security, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, and diminished ecosystem services. Urban sprawl onto other land uses could further strain urban infrastructure and public services. Future research should incorporate uncertainty analysis methods such as fuzzy logic or Bayesian methodologies to quantify and differentiate uncertainties related to modeling simulations.",Not About Sufficiency
Multiple pathways towards sustainable development goals and climate targets,"The UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris climate target require a holistic transformation towards human well-being within planetary boundaries. However, there are growing debates on how to best pursue these targets. Proposed transformation strategies include market- and technology-driven green-growth, shifting towards a sufficiency-oriented post-growth economy, and a transformation driven primarily by strong government action. Here we quantify three alternative sustainable development pathways (SDPs), Economy-driven Innovation, Resilient Communities, and Managing the Global Commons, that reflect these different societal strategies. We compare the quantifications from two integrated assessment models and two sectoral models of the buildings and materials sectors across a broad set of indicators for sustainable development and climate action. Our global multi-scenario and multi-model analysis shows that all three SDPs enable substantial progress towards the human development goals of the SDGs. They simultaneously limit global warming and prevent further environmental degradation, with the sufficiency-oriented Resilient Communities scenario showing the lowest peak warming and lowest reliance on carbon dioxide removal as well as the largest improvements in biodiversity intactness. The SDPs also alleviate the concerns about the biogeophysical and technological feasibility of narrowly-focused climate change mitigation scenarios. However, the shifts in energy and food consumption patterns assumed in the SDPs, ranging from moderate in Economy-driven Innovation to very ambitious in Resilient Communities, also lead to increased challenges regarding socio-cultural feasibility.",Not About Sufficiency
Multidimensional spatial inequality in China and its relationship with economic growth,"Spatial inequality erodes social cohesion and political stability, impacting global sustainable development and human well-being. This study examines spatial inequality in China across economic, social, environmental, infrastructural, and innovation dimensions, exploring how these inequalities evolve with economic development. Drawing on the Sustainable Development Goals and Chinese planning goals, we selected 13 indicators pertinent to human well-being. We employed the population-weighted coefficient of variation, Gini coefficient, and Moran's I to assess spatial inequalities and analyzed their relationship with economic growth. The findings reveal that China currently exhibits the highest spatial inequality in innovation and the lowest in the social dimension. Since 1990, most indicators have trended towards decreasing spatial inequality, except for unemployment rates and carbon emissions, which have increased. The economic and innovation gap between the eastern coastal regions and the central and western regions has widened, whereas disparities in housing, healthcare, roads, and digitalization have narrowed. China's experience demonstrates that Williamson's inverted U-shaped hypothesis extends beyond the economic domain to encompass education, healthcare, infrastructure, and digitalization, providing policy insights for addressing regional inequalities in China in the post-pandemic era.",Not About Sufficiency
Movements shaping climate futures: A systematic mapping of protests against fossil fuel and low-carbon energy projects,"In this article we undertake a systematic mapping of 649 cases of resistance movements to both fossil fuel (FF) and low carbon energy (LCE) projects, providing the most comprehensive overview of such place-based energy-related mobilizations to date. We find that (1) Place-based resistance movements are succeeding in curbing both fossil-fuel and low-carbon energy projects. Over a quarter of projects encountering social resistance have been cancelled, suspended or delayed. (2) The evidence highlights that low carbon, renewable energy and mitigation projects are as conflictive as FF projects, and that both disproportionately impact vulnerable groups such as rural communities and Indigenous peoples. Amongst LCE projects, hydropower was found to have the highest number of conflicts with concerns over social and environmental damages. (3) Repression and violence against protesters and land defenders was rife in almost all activities, with 10% of all cases analysed involving assassination of activists. Violence was particularly common in relation to hydropower, biomass, pipelines and coal extraction. Wind, solar and other renewables were the least conflictive and entailed lower levels of repression than other projects. The results caution that decarbonization of the economy is by no means inherently environmentally innocuous or socially inclusive. We find that conflicts and collective action are driven by multiple concerns through which community mobilization seeks to reshape the energy regime and its impacts. These include claims for localization, democratic participation, shorter energy chains, anti-racism, climate-justice-focused governance, and Indigenous leadership. Climate and energy policymakers need to pay closer attention to the demands and preferences of these collective movements pointing to transformative pathways to decarbonization.",Not About Sufficiency
Global review of human waste-picking and its contribution to poverty alleviation and a circular economy,"Across the globe, the livelihood of millions of people relies on the recovery and sale of valuable materials previously discarded as waste. In developed countries, this is mainly incorporated into the official recycling and resources recovery sector, while in developing countries the informal waste picking activities often make a major contribution. Waste picking provides important opportunities to people who have few or no marketable skills and education and no alternative sources of income to survive. However, waste pickers’ living conditions remain deplorable, and their working conditions continue to be dangerous due to hazardous waste. Given the social, economic, and environmental benefits waste pickers bring, and particularly their contribution to circular economy goals in developing nations, the role of waste pickers has mostly been undervalued on the development agenda. This paper examines the literature on waste pickers around the world, their working and living conditions, and explores the issue of formalisation. A total of 45 papers published from 1994 to 2022 were reviewed, covering case studies on waste pickers from 27 different countries. We analyse the content of these papers based on a list of key themes: poverty, health, stigma, environmental factors, informality, and formalisation. We find that the informal status of waste pickers, and the question of them being formalised into a Municipal Solid Waste Management sector is discussed extensively in the literature, and we delve deeper into this theme. Formalisation can potentially bring considerable improvement to the lives of waste pickers, including legal recognition, safe working conditions and fair bargaining mechanisms. In practice however, we find that formalisation policies take significantly different forms from one country to another and often fail to provide these benefits.",Not About Sufficiency

Modeling expected air quality impacts of Oregon?s proposed expanded clean fuels program,"The public health burden of traffic-related air pollution falls most heavily on the population living closest to major transportation corridors, which leads to exposure disparities between different socio-economic groups across the United States. The state of Oregon has adopted climate policies to reduce transportation fuel carbon intensity (CI). These climate policies have the potential co-benefit of reducing air pollution exposure disparities for different socio-economic groups. Here we analyze the emissions and air quality outcomes of three future year (2035) scenarios for transportation fuels in Oregon: (i) a Business as usual (BAU) scenario, (ii) a Clean Fuels Program (CFP) scenario that represents adoption and successful achievement of a proposed 25% reduction in carbon intensity in 2035; and (iii) a maximum ambition scenario (CFP MAX) that builds on the CFP scenario to achieve a 37% CI reduction by adopting low carbon fuels more aggressively, especially for heavy duty vehicles. Transportation emissions under all scenarios were estimated using the MOVES model for every county in Oregon. Detailed emissions with 4 km spatial resolution were then developed for each scenario by scaling the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for the year 2017 based on the emissions derived from the MOVES analysis. Air quality in 2035 was simulated using the UCD/CIT chemical transport model that enables a detailed analysis of PM2.5 and PM0.1 components and sources. Exposure fields were analyzed using the BenMAP model to predict public health outcomes. Environmental justice analysis was conducted by race/ethnicity categories and income categories obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS). Results suggest that adoption of low-carbon transportation fuels will improve air quality in Oregon, yielding public health benefits equivalent to approximately $80M/yr. Adoption of low carbon transportation fuels will also reduce disparities in exposure to transportation-related air pollution between residents in different race/ethnicity categories by -14% in Portland and -20% in Salem. Adoption of low-carbon fuels reduces PM2.5 mass disparity by 10% in Salem, but does not have a significant effect in Portland, because on-road mobile sources contribute to less than 3% of the total PM2.5 mass disparity in this city. The analysis reveals that the spatial distribution of each race/ethnicity group in each city is the primary factor that determines the impact of low carbon fuel adoption on exposure disparity.",Not About Sufficiency

To fulfill the quota obligations, many countries have adopted environmental policies such as carbon tax (CT) and feed-in tariff (FIT) in their electricity sectors. This paper aims to examine the impacts of different environmental policies on the electricity market competition and the social welfare. For this purpose. Cournot equilibrium models for electricity wholesale market competition are developed taking into account the CT and the FIT policies. The nonlinear complementarity approach is employed to solve these equilibrium problems. In addition, an environmental policy that combines the carbon tax and the feed-in tariff (CT&FIT) is also proposed in this paper.

Mitigating inequality with emissions? Exploring energy justice and financing transitions to low carbon energy in Indonesia,"Many countries around the globe demonstrate a growing commitment to achieve universal electrification in alignment with Sustainable Development Goal 7. Indonesia is among the countries that have made a concerted effort to alleviate energy poverty, mindful that around 25 million of its citizens live without access to electricity. This article examines Indonesia's efforts to realize its vision of energy justice by mobilizing private finance for renewable rural electrification. In particular, it investigates to what extent and in what ways Indonesia has addressed energy justice issues and their social implications. Interviews and document analysis reveal that Indonesia's energy justice vision has manifested in policies and initiatives that focus narrowly on distributive energy justice in terms of energy accessibility and affordability. However, procedural and recognition aspects of energy justice remain unaddressed. Such a myopic interpretation of energy justice has resulted in policies that prioritize large scale and on-grid solutions and substantially reduce financial options for small and distributed renewable energy initiatives. It also perpetuates spatial inequality and reinforces the exclusion and disempowerment of energy poor communities from energy decisions. The findings suggest that for a broader energy justice vision to be realized, it will be necessary to design and implement energy policies that holistically address all elements of energy justice and facilitate the use of diverse forms of finance to address energy poverty.",Not About Sufficiency

Our critical review of the literature synthesizes lithium supply chain dynamics and interdisciplinary critiques of lithium extractivism. It exposes the contradictions and challenges in relying on lithium for climate solutions. Key issues include high water usage, toxic waste, COQ emissions, and deepening global inequalities along racial and class lines.

Mexican cities and environmental discrimination: the challenges of urban environmental justice,"Urban environmental justice combines social and environmental elements, based on the recognition that the unequal spatial and social distribution of negative environmental impacts and the positive implications derived from the application of norms and environmental public policies on protection coexist. The instruments of urban planning have been key to provoking, by action, that socio-environmental inequity. The objective of this work is to relate the environmental and social issue in the framework of urban planning. The urban development has been created from the existence of two phenomena: socio-spatial segregation and environmental injustice, causing in Mexican cities and in many other territories, disadvantaged and vulnerable groups suffer, by government decision, a disproportionate and unequal burden of the effects of environmental degradation due to the authorization low cost housing in sites that present high levels of direct contamination. Worse yet, these same groups do not have the same access to environmental goods.

Methods for assessing social impacts of policies in relation to absolute boundaries,"There is an urgent need for designing truly sustainable policies supporting transformational change, and consequently for integrated tools to avoid burden shifting from different dimensions of sustainability. The Safe and Just Operating Space concept holds potential to support sustainable design of policies and decision making, using both the planetary boundaries framework and key social dimensions on an absolute perspective. Yet there is a lack of associated quantitative social assessment approaches. A new methodology is developed to evaluate the social sustainability of a policy against absolute boundaries. First, the methodology quantifies the state of a system, in 15 social dimensions defined systematically. Second, it estimates the social impacts of a new policy and observes if it will contribute to reduce the social shortfall. A geothermal energy development policy in Uganda is taken as an illustrative example for proof-of-concept. In the metrics of the Social Foundation of the Just Operating Space, the implementation of the policy would substantially improve the social performance of Energy and Health. Conclusively, this methodology holds potential to help early-phase policy design that do not unintentionally shift burdens between social dimensions, albeit further work remains to test the methodology and apply it in absolute integrated assessments.",Not About Sufficiency
"Metals for energy & digital transition in Spain: Demand, recycling and sufficiency alternatives","This study employs Material Flow Analysis (MFA) to comprehensively forecast metal demand in alignment with energy and digital transition policies at the country level, focusing on Spain. Our analysis spans eight technologies and ten metal groups, projecting metal demand and end-of-life recycling by 2050. We apply ambitious collection and recycling rate objectives, providing estimates of primary extraction requirements. We define and evaluate six scenarios targeting circular economy and sufficiency alternatives aimed at reducing primary extraction. Our results highlight electric mobility as the predominant driver of future metal demand, accounting for 54-92 % of cumulative demand for aluminum, copper, manganese, cobalt, nickel, lithium, dysprosium, and neodymium. From a global justice perspective, the 'equitable fraction of global reserves' for lithium and cobalt is surpassed. Ambitious recycling efforts could potentially cover 23-68 % of the cumulative metal demand between 2020 and 2050, while implementing circular economy and sufficiency alternatives might reduce primary extraction requirements by 11-61 %.",Not About Sufficiency
Bitter fruit: Attractive supermarket displays of tropical fruit conceal ugly environmental and social costs,"Within the context of globalization and trade liberalization, many countries of the South have been compelled to increase their dependence on the global economy. Food security in particular has been affected by new structural conditions and trading patterns. In the long term these trading patterns undermine self-sufficiency in the South. Food security is further eroded by the environmental degradation resulting from the clearing of land for plantations, and the heavy and often indiscriminate application of agrochemicals. While Northern consumers are increasingly concerned about pesticide residue on their fruits and vegetables, southern farm workers and their families suffer more immediate, acute and often long-term health effects. This situation is often exacerbated by low wages, employment insecurity, bans or restrictions on labour organization, and human rights violations. Restoring environmental health and human dignity requires responses on several levels. At the global level numerous groups are involved in halting the process of corporate globalization and unfair trade liberalization and their pernicious effects on national self-sufficiency. They include, among others, the Council of Canadians, Amnesty International, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, OXFAM, Food First, and the International Forum on Globalization. Trade agreements such as the proposed Multi-lateral Agreement on Investment are frequently the first target of such groups. At the same time, numerous grassroots organizations including growers co-operatives are working to promote justice and environmental health especially among small growers. For example, in Ecuador, the Union Regional de Organizaciones Campesinas del Littoral (UROCAL) is encouraging environmental improvements and promoting fair trade ventures among small producers of bananas.

"Energy: An Overview of Type, Form, Storage, Advantages, Efficiency, and Their Impact","ABSTRACTRecently, energy has been a research area due to increasing awareness of its advantages. Energy is essential for all daily activities and helps the mind and body grows; it has the ability to determine the growth of an economy and the development of a country. However, energy has its disadvantages. Nonrenewable energy is energy such as fossil fuel, which is the main cause of air pollutant emissions, such as carbon dioxide, synthetic fluorinated gases, water vapor, and methane gases; and nuclear energy, its wastes are the main cause of air pollutant. They are also the main cause of global warming, human health, climate change, and environmental degradation from the extraction up to use. Nowadays, fossil fuel energy is used in production and use of energy in all sectors of the world. Nuclear energy is the most powerful energy source. Renewable energy, such as solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, tidal, wave, and hydrogen energy, produces zero greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels, reducing air pollution and combating climate change, improving public health, mitigating smog and acid rain, and long‐term sustainability. The production and use of this renewable energy has been increasing, but it is not sufficient to meet the demand of all sectors in the world. Hydrogen energy is the future of fossil fuels and nuclear energy, free of CO2 emissions, and radioactive waste. The hydrogen economy envisions using hydrogen as a clean, versatile, and sustainable energy carrier to replace fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We must control the impacts of energy first by knowing the types of energy and their impact, and then totally replace nonrenewable energy with renewable energy in the future by increasing the efficiency of renewable energy. To increase the efficiency of energy production, energy storage (storing high amount of energy in a small space) uses nanomaterials and green nanomaterial technologies. International cooperation and policy alignment will be essential for driving global transition to a sustainable energy future. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the energy sector becomes more sustainable, efficient, and resilient, supporting the transition toward a low‐carbon future. Harmonizing energy policies, sharing best practices, and aligning climate commitments can facilitate the development of a coordinated approach to addressing energy challenges on a global scale. By incorporating these considerations into energy planning and decision‐making, stakeholders can work toward building a future energy system that is sustainable, resilient, and capable of meeting the energy needs of a rapidly changing world. In this study, a critical review of the type, form, storage, advantages, efficiency, respective, and their impact are reviewed.

Measuring the Doughnut: A good life for all is possible within planetary boundaries,"Humanity is continuing a path towards ecological instability. While resource consumption is unprecedented, significant parts of the human population are still deprived of decent living. The safe and just operating space postulates that it is possible to simultaneously stay within ecological limits and fulfil basic needs. However, evidence that such a state can be achieved given existing population and available technologies is lacking. Here, we attempt to show whether a safe and just space exists by modelling material and energy requirements for satisfying basic needs with various technological scenarios. Environmental impacts of a basket of products representing basic needs satisfaction are measured through life cycle analysis and compared to planetary boundaries for the first time. We find that all planetary boundaries considered can be respected for 8.0 and 10.4 billion people with a probability of 81% and 73% respectively. However, this requires a fossil-free energy system, and an essentially vegan diet as well as no additional cropland conversion. To actually create and enlarge a safe and just operating space, carbon dioxide emissions, biodiversity, Phosphorus and Nitrogen emissions would need to be further reduced, mainly by improved agricultural practices and material circularity. Significance Statement The purpose of this study is to find out if humanity can fulfil basic needs for all humans without destabilizing the Earth system. This information is relevant for identifying pathways to futures in which all humans can live good lives without compromising the livelihoods of future generations. Our results show that it is theoretically possible to satisfy the basic needs of 10.4 billion people within ecological limits.

Measuring sustainable development - Nation by nation,"Sustainable development represents a commitment to advancing human well-being, with the added constraint that this development needs to take place within the ecological limits of the biosphere. Progress in both these dimensions of sustainable development can be assessed: we use the UN Human Development Index (HDI) as an indicator of development and the Ecological Footprint as an indicator of human demand on the biosphere. We argue that an HDI of no less than 0.8 and a per capita Ecological Footprint less than the globally available biocapacity per person represent minimum requirements for sustainable development that is globally replicable. Despite growing global adoption of sustainable development as an explicit policy goal, we find that in the year 2003 only one of the 93 countries surveyed met both of these minimum requirements. We also find an overall trend in high-income countries over the past twenty five years that improvements to HDI come with disproportionately larger increases in Ecological Footprint, showing a movement away from sustainability. Some lower-income countries, however, have achieved higher levels of development without a corresponding increase in per capita demand on ecosystem resources. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Nexus between environmental sustainability, energy intensity and food security: evidence from emerging economies","PurposeGrowing food insecurity is a leading cause of fatalities, particularly in developing nations like Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. However, the rising energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are mostly associated with food production. Balancing the trade-offs between energy intensity and food security remains a top priority for environmentalists. Despite the critical role of the environment in food security, there is a scarcity of substantial studies that explore the statistical connections among food security, CO2 emissions, energy intensity, foreign direct investment (FDI) and per capita income. Therefore, this study aims to provide more precise and consistent estimates of per capita CO2 emissions by considering the interplay of food security and energy intensity within the context of emerging economies.Design/methodology/approachTo examine the long-term relationships between CO2 emissions, food security, energy efficiency, FDI and economic development in emerging economies, this study employs correlated panel-corrected standard error, regression with Newey–West standard error and regression with Driscoll–Kraay standard error models (XTSCC). The analysis utilizes data spanning from 1980 to 2018 and encompasses 32 emerging economies.FindingsThe study reveals that increasing food security in a developing economy has a substantial positive impact on both CO2 emissions and energy intensity. Each model, on average, demonstrates that a 1 percent improvement in food security results in a 32% increase in CO2 levels. Moreover, the data align with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory, as it indicates a positive correlation between gross domestic product (GDP) in developing nations and CO2 emissions. Finally, all experiments consistently demonstrate a robust correlation between the Food Security Index (FSI), energy intensity level (EIL) and exchange rate (EXR) in developing markets and CO2 emissions. This suggests that these factors significantly contribute to environmental performance in these countries.Originality/valueThis study introduces novelty by employing diverse techniques to uncover the mixed findings regarding the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic expansion. Additionally, it integrates energy intensity and food security into a new model. Moreover, the study contributes to the literature by advocating for a sustainable development goal (SDG)-oriented policy framework that considers all variables influencing economic growth.",Not About Sufficiency

Uncertainties in the link between global climate change and predicted health risks from pollution: Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) case study using a fugacity model,"Industrial societies have altered the earth's environment in ways that could have important, long-term ecological, economic, and health implications. In this paper, we examine the extent to which uncertainty about global climate change could impact the precision of predictions of secondary outcomes such as health impacts of pollution. Using a model that links global climate change with predictions of chemical exposure and human health risk in the Western region of the United States of America (U.S.), we define parameter variabilities and uncertainties and we characterize the resulting outcome variance. As a case study, we consider the public health consequences from releases of hexachlorobenzene (HCB), a ubiquitous multimedia pollutant. By constructing a matrix that links global environmental change both directly and indirectly to potential human-health effects attributable to HCB released into air, soil, and water, we define critical parameter variances in the health risk estimation process. We employ a combined uncertainty/sensitivity analysis to investigate how HCB releases are affected by increasing atmospheric temperature and the accompanying climate alterations that are anticipated. We examine how such uncertainty impacts both the expected magnitude and calculational precision of potential human exposures and health effects. This assessment reveals that uncertain temperature increases of up to 5°C have little impact on either the magnitude or precision of the public-health consequences estimated under existing climate variations for HCB released into air and water in the Western region of the U.S.",Not About Sufficiency

Material flow accounting for an Irish rural community engaged in energy efficiency and renewable energy generation,"Sustainability transitions have been embraced in regions throughout the world in response to climate change fears, economic decline, public health concerns and environmental degradation. There is increasing evidence to support the idea that the best way of ensuring communities can become more resilient to the effects of climate change and environmental degradation is for them to become more sustainable up to and including an ability to become carbon neutral and energy sufficient. At the core of any sustainability transition is community leaders and stakeholders. These are the people that have first-hand knowledge of what their communities need and what they can offer in terms of local knowledge, services and supports. Urban and rural regions are responding to inadequate actions at national and international level by initiating their own action plans. Community based projects may have an important role to play in promoting the ideals of sustainability and sustainable communities. Community based projects have been shown to have a greater ability to engage and empower local actors and stakeholders than top-down initiatives which, in many instances, have failed. Ballynagran in Ireland serves as a rural case study.

Their service in separating and recycling this waste creates a ""circular flow"" of the economy, a ""cradle-to-cradle"" model as mandated by the UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals, to be achieved by 2030. Presented here is an organization development case study that identifies the path and vital factors for social innovation by a non-governmental organization NGO which has reduced the health and climate change risk by organizing the waste pickers and ushering in women empowerment, behavioral change, social inclusion, and social innovation. Professionals and academicians can formalize the model presented for further evolution in organization development and practice in this nascent sector.",Not About Sufficiency

Neutral and negative effects of policy bundling on support for decarbonization,"Decarbonization policies are frequently combined with other policies to increase public support or address related societal issues. To investigate the consequences of policy bundling, we conducted a survey experiment with 2,521 U.S. adults. We examined the effects of bundling decarbonization with policies favored by liberals (social justice and economic redistribution), broad bipartisan coalitions (infrastructure), and conservatives (pausing EPA regulations) on public support and polarization. Bundling with pausing EPA regulations decreased support and polarization by reducing liberal support without significantly increasing conservative support. Bundling with social justice decreased support while increasing polarization by reducing conservative support without significantly increasing liberal support. Bundling with economic redistribution and infrastructure did not significantly change support or polarization. Policy bundling thus risks decreasing public support for decarbonization policies by alienating one ideological side of the electorate without gaining support from the other side. This risk exists even when policy bundling reduces polarization.",Not About Sufficiency
"Poverty, income distribution and policy making","This paper deals with the key distributional issues arising from the regulation of the environment and the management of natural resources. The paper is divided into a section dealing with poverty and a section dealing with broader income distribution effects. Although there is much discussion of the linkages of poverty to environmental degradation, empirical studies establishing these linkages are few. The relationship is critically dependent on the institutional structures in the countries concerned and how they respond to changing environmental pressures. On the broader distributional impacts, the papers focusses on the analysis of ganiers and losers from environmental regulations. The analysis is complex because the direct incidence is not the same as the final incidence. Much of the work has looked only at the former. In addition, the political economy of regulation needs to pay greater attention to impacts on key and vulnerable groups; more so than can be done by looking at broad income bands.; This paper deals with the key distributional issues arising from the regulation of the environment and the management of natural resources.

Impact of Land Use Changes on Ecosystem Services Supply: A Meta Analysis of the Italian Context,"Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are caused by several factors, including climate change, socio-demographic dynamics, human pressures and urban sprawl. These factors alter the structure and functionality of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services to society. The study of LULC changes is important for understanding the dynamics of relationships between environmental, social and economic components and for analyzing the factors affecting natural capital. Including ecosystem services (ES) in spatial planning tools and sectoral policies is useful for improving governance. In this paper, the impact of LULC changes on ES provision has been estimated. To this end, we carried out a literature review (Step 1) to select the biophysical and economic coefficients of ES supply by land cover classes and collect them in a database (Step 2). We subsequently aggregated the economic and biophysical coefficients by macro classes (Step 3) and, using the benefit transfer approach, we estimated the change in the supply of ESs concerning permanence and transition phenomena in Italy from 1990 to 2018 (Step 4). The transition phenomena analysis also allowed us to evaluate the consequences of urbanization and urban green space governance on ES supply. Indeed, these urban green spaces can help reduce risks to people’s health and safety and mitigate the effects induced by climate change. In total, approximately 800 coefficients (biophysical and economic) of ESs supplied by Corine Land Cover classes were acquired. The results show a reduction in the annual supply of ecosystem services of EUR 927 million (2022) caused by LULC changes between 1990 and 2018. This research proposes a methodology to improve knowledge of ESs concerning anthropogenic impacts and to support land-use planning policies regarding Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals.",Not About Sufficiency
"Analysis of Research on the SDGs: The Relationship between Climate Change, Poverty and Inequality","Since its adoption in September 2015, the 2030 Agenda has laid the foundations for a model of shared prosperity for a sustainable world. The current global pandemic highlights profound inequalities affecting our economies, health, and quality of life. For this reason, the aim of this study was to present the current state of scientific research related to inequality, poverty, and climate change, and to propose lines of improvement that can contribute to achieving three of the 17 SDGs (end poverty, SDG 1; reduce inequality, SDG 10; and climate action, SDG 13), proposed in the 2030 Agenda. For this purpose, we undertook a systematic literature review. The results show that the subject of poverty, inequality, and climate change has been little studied or articulated by researchers, and significant differences exist between the different areas studied. The highest number of publications (51.7%) is associated with topics related to sustainability—environment and economics. The remainder are distributed among 12 other research areas. Another relevant finding is that the effects of climate change are more pressing for more vulnerable populations, including impoverished women from rural areas and children from underdeveloped countries. This gender and social inequality has been rarely addressed in studies. Food security and energy poverty is another under-researched area. According to the results obtained in this work, we consider that the circular economy may improve these indicators, constituting a line of future research. Thus, one of the main objectives of this approach is to eliminate negative externalities, specifically the existing social inequalities within the current linear economy model.",Not About Sufficiency
Preface: The 6th International Conference on Environmental Resources Management (ICERM) 2024,"Anthropogenic pressure and climate change are the main issues of environmental degradation, posing significant challenges to sustainable landscape [1,2]. These issues are recognized as major global risks with long-lasting consequences [3]. Landscape management is an integrated approach that may be helpful to address these issues by combining policies and practices to address environmental degradation and promote sustainable land use planning [4]. This approach plays an important role in achieving sustainable livelihoods by integrating multiple objectives such as ecological, economic and social [5,6]. Proper landscape management can lead to numerous ecological benefits, including improved land restoration, increased forest cover, enhanced ecosystem services, and maintain the biodiversity [5,6,7]. In the economic and social context, land management can be beneficial for promoting food security, reducing vulnerability to climate change, and improving welfare [5,6,7].Department of Environmental Geography, the Faculty of Geography Universitas Gadjah Mada, has a long history of conducting research on environmental management. The concept of sustainable land management aligns with the department’s research framework, which emphasizes the analysis of land, water, social, and economic factors to improve population welfare and reduce risk. To address current issues and discuss efforts related to sustainable land management, the department is organizing the 6th International Conference on Environmental Resources Management (ICERM) to showcase the latest scientific advancements.List of Conference Committee is available in this pdf.",Not About Sufficiency
Mapping ecological distribution conflicts: The EJAtlas,"This article describes the origins of the terms ""environmental justice"" and ""environmentalism of the poor and the indigenous"" since the 1980s. In 2012 the collection of ""ecological distribution conflicts"" (EDC) in an Atlas of Environmental Justice (the EJAtlas) started. The EJAtlas reached 3350 entries by January 2021. Such conflicts arise because the industrial economy is not circular, it is entropic. Since the industrial economy is entropic, it continuously looks for new energy and material sources at the ""commodity extraction frontiers"", and for waste disposal sites. There are counter-movements of resistance, which become also ""valuation system contests"" since the participants in such movements (environmental organizations, indigenous peoples, peasants, neighbors and citizens) display different values. Examples recorded in the EJAtlas are given from different continents while answering the questions: Why did the world movement for environmental justice come into being, and which type of social movement is it? The relevance of the EJAtlas for research on comparative, statistical political ecology but also on business economics and management, is noticed.",Not About Sufficiency
Land degradation in South Africa: Justice and climate change in tension,"Land degradation is a global problem impacting biodiversity and livelihoods, with profound effects on resource‐based livelihoods. As such, it impedes progress towards sustainable development goals (SDGs) and overcoming climate‐related poverty. Interrelated biophysical and social factors are driving further land degradation, and, internationally, there is a range of policies and initiatives designed to address these.In this paper, we argue that analysis of land degradation must encompass three key dimensions: firstly, that the causes are both physical and social; secondly, that they are shaped by historically unjust land tenure and resource allocations; and thirdly, that outcomes are the result of entwined processes at the global, national and local levels. To do this, we modify an analytical framework derived from structuration theory and populate it with illustrative material from the case of rangeland management in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. In this way, we show how understanding land degradation requires an analytical approach that is simultaneously bio‐social, historically informed and multiscalar.Land degradation caused by woody encroachment is a major bio‐social issue for the rangelands of South Africa, exacerbated by intersecting factors including climate change, historical land tenure policies and post‐apartheid reforms. However, contemporary land use policies in South Africa designed to redress historic land injustices and enhance rural livelihoods are not directly connected with those which prioritise the protection of ecosystems and biodiversity, or climate mitigation. Finally, South African policymakers face the challenge of reconciling political commitments to improve the lives of local populations whilst meeting international targets to address degradation, carbon emissions and SDGs.Whilst the South African case is unique, many countries face the simultaneous challenges of trying to prevent ecological degradation whilst mitigating historical patterns of unjust access to land and natural resources. More broadly, this talks of the global challenge of reconciling goals of poverty alleviation with climate mitigation.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.",Not About Sufficiency
Managing the global land resource,"With a growing population with changing demands, competition for the global land resource is increasing. We need to feed a projected population of 9-10 billion by 2050, rising to approximately 12 billion by 2100. At the same time, we need to reduce the climate impact of agriculture, forestry and other land use, and we almost certainly need to deliver land-based greenhouse gas removal for additional climate change mitigation. In addition, we need to deliver progress towards meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, all without compromising the many ecosystem services provided by land and without exceeding planetary boundaries. Managing the land to tackle these pressing issues is a major global challenge.

Smart web-based geospatial decision support systems (S-DSSs) for land use planning and management is a useful tool for sustainable development. Forensic soil science can also contribute to cold case investigations, both in providing intelligence and evidence in court and in ascertaining the provenance and safety of food products.

"Managing and mitigating future public health risks: Planetary boundaries, global catastrophic risk, and inclusive wealth","There are two separate conceptualizations for assessing existential risks: Planetary Boundaries (PBs) and global catastrophic risks (GCRs). While these concepts are similar in principle, their underpinning literatures tend not to engage with each other. Research related to these concepts has tended to be siloed in terms of the study of specific threats and also in terms of how these are assumed to materialize; PBs attribute global catastrophes to slow-moving and potentially irreversible global changes, while GCRs focuses on cataclysmic short-term events. We argue that there is a need for a more unified approach to managing global long-term risks, which recognizes the complex and confounded nature of the interactions between PBs and GCRs. We highlight where the PB and GCR concepts overlap and outline these complexities using an example of public health, namely, pandemics and food insecurity. We also present an existing indicator that we argue can be used for monitoring and managing risk. We argue for greater emphasis on national and global ''inclusive wealth'' as a way to measure economic activity and thus to monitor and mitigate the unintended consequences of economic activity. In sum, we call for a holistic approach to stewardship aimed at preserving the integrity of natural capital in the face of a broad range of global risks and their respective regional or global manifestations.",Not About Sufficiency

MachIne learning for nutrient recovery in the smart city circular economy-A review,"Urbanisation is leading to a concentration of growing city populations that contribute significantly to economic growth, while becoming epicentres of waste generation, greenhouse gas emissions, and food consumption. Nutrient smart city circular economy is currently an understudied intersection of growing city populations of food consumers, nutrient recovery technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), and agriculture. Meanwhile, machine learning has exploded with popularity over the years, with many circular economy literatures examining its usefulness in its predictive qualities to support management, optimisation, and recovery of useful resources from organic waste. This review paper examines advancements in machine learning for macronutrient recovery in city organic waste systems for a circular economy. The use of ML will greatly improve the scalability, transparency, productivity and accuracy of nutrient: recovery technologies, logistics, dissemination, and reuse. ML can also be combined with hardware to automate tedious waste separation, recovery and agricultural tasks using drones, hydroponics and satellites.

Cost-effectiveness of removing the last 10%–20% emissions of China’s power sector,"Power system decarbonization is central to achieving global net-zero emissions goals. While existing studies highlight the technological complexities, flexibility challenges, and cost implications of achieving carbon neutrality, mitigating the last 10%–20% of power system emissions in China has not been sufficiently addressed. Here, we estimate the impacts of eliminating the last 10%–20% of CO2 emissions on new capacity, the transmission network, system costs, and climate and public health benefits. We find that although system costs slightly increase (less than 1%) under deep decarbonization in China, climate and health benefits are substantial. We further investigate the role of three important emission mitigation technologies (nuclear, offshore wind, and carbon capture and storage) in power system deep decarbonization. Our analysis shows that none of these technologies would significantly affect future system costs but they influence both the quantity and location of renewable energy installations and the expansion of China’s transmission network. With China’s power system, the world’s largest, we demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of achieving a net-zero electricity sector and offer insights on implications for renewable development and transmission expansion when prioritizing decarbonization technologies.",Not About Sufficiency
Accelerating China’s power sector decarbonization can save lives: integrating public health goals into power sector planning decisions,"China, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter in 2022, aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The power sector will play a major role in this decarbonization process due to its current reliance on coal. Prior studies have quantified air quality co-benefits from decarbonization or investigated pathways to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector. However, few have jointly assessed the potential impacts of accelerating decarbonization on electric power systems and public health. Additionally, most analyses have treated air quality improvements as co-benefits of decarbonization, rather than a target during decarbonization. Here, we explore future energy technology pathways in China under accelerated decarbonization scenarios with a power system planning model that integrates carbon, pollutant, and health impacts. We integrate the health effects of power plant emissions into the power system decision-making process, quantifying the public health impacts of decarbonization under each scenario. We find that compared with a reference decarbonization pathway, a stricter cap (20% lower emissions than the reference pathway in each period) on carbon emissions would yield significant co-benefits to public health, leading to a 22% reduction in power sector health impacts. Although extra capital investment is required to achieve this low emission target, the value of climate and health benefits would exceed the additional costs, leading to $824 billion net benefits from 2021 to 2050. Another accelerated decarbonization pathway that achieves zero emissions five years earlier than the reference case would result in lower net benefits due to higher capital costs during earlier decarbonization periods. Treating air pollution impacts as a target in decarbonization can further mitigate both CO2 emissions and negative health effects. Alternative low-cost solutions also show that small variations in system costs can result in significantly different future energy portfolios, suggesting that diverse decarbonization pathways are viable.",Not About Sufficiency

Quantifying food security and mitigation risks consequential to climate change impacts on crop yields,"Climate change is expected to impact crop yields globally, with some regions benefiting from favorable conditions and CO2 fertilization, while others face adverse effects from altered precipitation and higher temperatures. Changes in crop yields can destabilize the global food system and pose challenges to food security. Moreover, crop production is crucial, as biofuels are becoming increasingly important contributors to climate change mitigation measures aimed at limiting global warming. This study uses the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment integrated assessment model framework to analyze different indicators related to food security and climate change mitigation under varying climate change impacts on crop yields. Twelve spatially explicit crop productivity projections were taken from the full archive of the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison of 120 climate-crop model combinations, forced by CMIP6-based climate scenarios. The selection includes two average-performing climate-crop model combinations, two pessimistic combinations that perform one standard deviation below the mean, and two optimistic model combinations that perform one standard deviation above the mean. To single out the effect of climate change on productivity changes, we drew samples from two representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). These productivity projections were applied within an otherwise uniform scenario (SSP2) and analyzed for their effect on total calorie demand, crop prices, and number of people at risk of undernourishment to quantify food security. Risks to climate change mitigation targets were explored by modeling the total bioenergy supply, emissions, and global mean temperature. The results revealed significant differences in the risk of food security and mitigation potential between different regions and climate change scenarios. Across scenarios, the crop area extent can vary up to 2 million km2 due to changing crop yields. The projected change in global hunger ranges from 60 to 160 million undernourished people, indicating uncertainty between climate and crop model combinations. Low-income regions are especially impacted because of their high sensitivity to changes in food prices. Global climate change mitigation ambitions can also deviate by the latter part of the 21st century, as changes in yields will impact biofuel production as well as agriculture, forestry and other land use emissions. The quantitative insights generated by this study highlight the need for global policy efforts to make the agricultural system more adaptive to climate change to handle potential negative impacts.",Not About Sufficiency

Low carbon energy and its role in reducing the energy poverty: A case study of China,"The global shift towards low-carbon energy systems is accelerating, driven by initiatives like Green Deals that offer significant techno-economic advantages. However, the transformation of energy infrastructure involves complex socio-technical challenges, particularly when integrating principles of energy justice into energy policy. This study addresses these challenges by examining the concept of ""just transitions,"" which aims to align decarbonization efforts with goals of social justice and equality. This research specifically focuses on the issue of energy poverty, defined as the lack of access to adequate energy services, and propose that addressing this issue is essential for equitable energy transitions. Through a theoretical framework, this study analyzes three scenarios of evolving energy infrastructure, illustrating how cross-sectoral strategies can effectively reduce energy poverty while promoting sustainable development. Our findings reveal that prioritizing energy justice not only enhances social welfare but also supports the broader objectives of decarbonization. The research underscores the importance of inclusive energy policies that address both environmental and social dimensions, ensuring that the benefits of low-carbon transitions are equitably distributed.

Socio-environmental impacts of mineral mining and conflicts in Southern and West Africa: navigating reflexive governance for environmental justice,"Mineral mining activities in Africa have long been associated with a myriad of socio-environmental impacts and conflicts, posing significant challenges to sustainable development and environmental justice. This paper explores the complex interplay between mineral mining, socio-environmental impacts, and conflicts in the Southern and West African region, with a focus on the imperative of reflexive governance for achieving just transitions and environmental justice. Drawing on a comprehensive literature review and cases from Southern and Western African countries, this paper examines the multifaceted nature of socio-environmental impacts resulting from mineral mining. These impacts encompass ecological degradation and social inequalities, among others. Furthermore, the paper delves into the dynamics of conflicts arising from mineral mining and competing interests such as natural resources and land rights. Additionally, the paper examines governance structures aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and environmental sustainability. The paper concludes by highlighting the implications of reflexive governance as a transformative tool for addressing the socio-environmental impacts of mineral mining and conflicts in Southern and West Africa.

Multidimensional spatial inequality in China and its relationship with economic growth,"Spatial inequality erodes social cohesion and political stability, impacting global sustainable development and human well-being. This study examines spatial inequality in China across economic, social, environmental, infrastructural, and innovation dimensions, exploring how these inequalities evolve with economic development. Drawing on the Sustainable Development Goals and Chinese planning goals, we selected 13 indicators pertinent to human well-being. We employed the population-weighted coefficient of variation, Gini coefficient, and Moran’s I to assess spatial inequalities and analyzed their relationship with economic growth. The findings reveal that China currently exhibits the highest spatial inequality in innovation and the lowest in the social dimension. Since 1990, most indicators have trended towards decreasing spatial inequality, except for unemployment rates and carbon emissions, which have increased. The economic and innovation gap between the eastern coastal regions and the central and western regions has widened, whereas disparities in housing, healthcare, roads, and digitalization have narrowed.

Linking inequalities and ecosystem services in Latin America,"Latin America exhibits one of the highest rates of biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) loss worldwide along with a remarkable asymmetry in the access to ES benefits (ecosystem services inequality, ESI hereafter). The objective of this manuscript is to propose and validate a conceptual model to understand the links between ESI and ecosystem services supply. First, previous ES frameworks were expanded to acknowledge the role of the unequal access to ES on socio-ecological system dynamics. Second an ESI conceptual model was posed to testing feed-back mechanisms between ESI and natural capital. Finally, independent information and expert opinions on ten case studies of five Latin American countries were used to quali-quantitatively validate the ESI model. The most rated ESI impacts were landscape and seascape transformations driven by the markets, overuse of natural capital, ecosystems degradation, and biodiversity loss. This study highlights that ESI may enhance the vulnerability of the socio-ecological systems, describing a self-reinforcing mechanism that differentially affects the well-being of the most economically disadvantaged beneficiaries (ESI traps). However, while the occurrence of ESI traps was inferred for half of the examined cases, remaining cases suggest that potential ESI traps did not operate, or that they were dampened by governance mechanisms.",Not About Sufficiency
Linking individuals' ecological footprint to their subjective well-being,"Sustainable development poses a major challenge to Western societies as many of their citizens have lifestyles with resource use beyond the earth's carrying capacity. Sustainability transitions will be easier to implement if they also increase individuals' well-being.

Our results suggest that a lower footprint does not reduce well-being in the sense that we find no significant correlation. In a next step, we investigate the direct impacts of the different ecological footprint components on subjective well-being. Switching to a more environmentally friendly diet and not using electricity for domestic heating create win-win situations as these actions decrease the ecological footprint while increasing reported levels of well-being. Finally, we investigate the socio-demographic determinants of the ecological footprint and subjective well-being to look for indirect impacts. Having a relationship and being a house owner increase subjective well-being and decrease the ecological footprint. Better social life and health and living in a pleasant environment increase subjective well-being with no cost in terms of ecological footprint. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The paper rests on several key arguments: First, a preliminary case is made for a more explicit recognition of the theoretical and empirical links between the socioeconomic problems of agricultural regions stemming from chronically low levels of producer surplus retention and similar problems of social welfare associated with reduced levels of remunerated labor in the industrial sector. Second, there is a parallel need for connecting the negative social and environmental costs of capitalist agriculture. The case study uses the evolving production process on individual farms as a means of exploring the causal relationship between the movement towards capitalist social relations and environmental degradation resulting from intensive patterns of synthetic chemical use. And third, the role of agency among family farmers faced with a regional economic crisis emerges from the case study analysis. In the 1980s, a small minority of Iowa farmers would adopt, perfect and disseminate a low-chemical input system of production attuned to the logic of family farm social relations. The contribution of the state-sponsored research institutions was notably absent. The case example highlights the process of technological change as a socially-constructed phenomenon subject to alternative forms of rationality that emerge from different syntheses of ecological conditions and social relations. © 1995.",Not About Sufficiency
Lifecycle social impacts of lithium-ion batteries: Consequences and future research agenda for a safe and just transition,"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are essential in the low-carbon energy transition. However, the social consequences of LIBs throughout the entire lifecycle have been insufficiently explored in the literature. To address this gap, this study conducted a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed literature, grey literature, and conflicts in the Global Atlas of Environmental Justice associated with LIBs lifecycle. The UNEP Social Lifecycle Assessment framework was utilised for categorisation of stakeholders and social impacts categories. The socio-ecological dynamics and consequences of the global production of LIBs were analysed from the perspective of the Safe and Just operating spaces of the Doughnut Economics (DE). The main results indicate that Worker, Local community, and Society are the most investigated stakeholders, while Consumers, Value chain actors and Children are overlooked. Social impact subcategories related to Safe and healthy living conditions and Access to material resources receive more attention due to social concerns about environmental and social degradation associated with raw material extraction in the LIBs lifecycle. The analysis from DE framework reveals that the increased business as usual production of LIBs can hinder the achievement of a safe and just transition due to undesired socio-ecological consequences, such as increased CO2 emissions, air pollution, land degradation, biodiversity loss, and water pollution that leading to increase poverty, inequality, discrimination (gender and race), health damage, corruption, and conflicts. More research is needed to understand and simulate social consequences of LIBs lifecycle. To this end, a holistic future research agenda is provided.",Not About Sufficiency
Monitoring spatiotemporal changes in land use/land cover and its impacts on ecosystem services in southern Zambia,"Ecosystems play a vital role in human well-being, yet the widespread loss of ecosystem services due to human activities, including agricultural expansion and deforestation, remains a significant concern. Despite the wealth of research highlighting the importance of ecosystem conservation in Zambia, a critical gap exists in understanding the interplay between the conservation of ecosystem services and the socio-economic needs of local communities. This study presents a comparative analysis of ecosystem services in two distinct landscapes within southern Zambia: the protected area of Kafue National Park (KNP) and the agricultural landscape of Kalomo district between 2000–2020. Employing a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, we evaluate the impacts of land/use and land cover (LULC) changes on selected ecosystem services, with a particular focus on carbon storage and the habitat quality of the trumpeter hornbill. The results of the comparison indicate that: (1) the Kalomo district has suffered from extensive land conversion, with forest changing to cropland, while KNP was well protected from encroachment, with forest area increasing over time; (2) carbon stocks and the habitat quality of trumpeter hornbills continually decreased in the Kalomo district but improved in KNP; (3) Kalomo district has suffered rapid environmental degradation due to an imbalance between economic development and environmental conservation, while strict enforcement in KNP has preserved ecosystems. The findings underscore the importance of integrated and inclusive land-use planning and natural resource governance for maintaining and enhancing ecosystem services in Zambia. To progress towards landscape management that is both sustainable and equitable, aligning with the objectives of the Global Biodiversity Framework, it is proposed that a comprehensive approach be adopted in the region. This approach should encompass a more thorough consideration of local livelihood requirements, as well as the wider political-economic and social factors at play.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Land Use Types on the Soil Erosion Resistance in the Arid Valley Region of Southwest China,"Changes in land use can alter the physicochemical properties of soil, thereby leading to variations in soil erosion resistance. In the past few decades, land use has changed very rapidly in the arid valley region in the Anning River Basin of Southwest China, but the impact of these changes on soil erosion resistance is still not yet clear. Thus, five typical land use types in this region, namely woodland, cropland, orchard land, abandoned land, and grassland, have been selected to explore the impact of land use types on soil erosion resistance, including factors such as the mean weight diameter (MWD), dispersion rate (DR), clay ratio (CR), soil organic carbon cementing agent index (SCAI), soil structure stability index (SSSI), K-factor, and comprehensive soil erosion resistance (CSER). The results showed that the land use type had a significant effect on soil erosion resistance, but the intensity of its influence varied across each soil erosion resistance index. Generally, woodland, abandoned land, and grassland demonstrated higher erosion resistance compared to cropland and orchard land. Additionally, surface soil exhibited stronger erosion resistance compared to subsoil, with the impact of land use types primarily concentrated in the surface soil layers. Moreover, soil organic matter content (SOM) emerged as the primary factor influencing soil erosion resistance. The research results can provide valuable guidance for regional land-use planning, aiming to reduce soil erosion and enhance the ecosystem’s service capacity, and can provide a theoretical basis for trade-offs between ecosystem services and food security.",Not About Sufficiency
"Ecological Management Zoning Based on the Supply–Demand Relationship and Synergies of Urban Forest Ecosystem Services: A Case Study from Fuzhou, China","Urban forests, as vital components of green infrastructure, provide essential ecosystem services (ESs) that support urban sustainability. However, rapid urban expansion and increased density threaten these forests, creating significant imbalances between the supply and demand for these services. Understanding the characteristics of ecosystem services and reasonably dividing ecological management zones are crucial for promoting sustainable urban development. This study introduces an innovative ecological management zoning framework based on the matching degree and synergies relationships of ESs. Focusing on Fuzhou’s fourth ring road area in China, data from 1038 urban forest sample plots were collected using mobile LIDAR. By integrating the i-Tree Eco model and Kriging interpolation, we assessed the spatial distribution of four key ESs—carbon sequestration, avoided runoff, air purification, and heat mitigation—and analyzed their supply–demand relationships and synergies. Based on these ecological characteristics, we employed unsupervised machine learning classification to identify eight distinct ecological management zones, each accompanied by targeted recommendations. Key findings include the following: (1) ecosystem services of urban forests in Fuzhou exhibit pronounced spatial heterogeneity, with clearly identifiable high-value and low-value areas of significant statistical relevance; (2) heat mitigation, avoided runoff, and air purification services all exhibit synergistic effects, while carbon sequestration shows trade-offs with the other three services in high-value areas, necessitating targeted optimization; (3) eight ecological management zones were identified, each with unique ecological characteristics. This study offers precise spatial insights into Fuzhou’s urban forests, providing a foundation for sustainable ecological management strategies.",Not About Sufficiency
The promotion of sustainable land use planning for the enhancement of ecosystem service capacity: Based on the FLUS-INVEST-RUSLE-CASA model,"Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) is one of the most significant human variables influencing the efficiency of Ecosystem Services (ESs) in terrestrial ecosystems. Theoretical and technical assistance for regional sustainable land use planning and management, as well as ecosystem conservation and restoration, is provided by investigating the influence of changes in the LULC pattern on the efficiency of ESs. This research focuses on the interactions between socioeconomic activities and natural ecological processes in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA). We use LULC data from the TGRA for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. The study includes the analysis and calculation of the spatiotemporal evolution features of the current LULC pattern and the efficiency of ESs, including their spatiotemporal distribution. Considering the TGRA’s national development orientation and guidance, three potential LULC patterns are constructed under various develop-ment scenarios. To calculate the efficiency of ESs, the GeoSOS-FLUS future LULC simulation model is linked, and several methodologies such as INVEST, RUSLE, and CASA are used. The goal is to investigate the influence of future changes in LULC patterns on ESs efficiency. The findings show the following: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the values of water conservation services in the TGRA decreased and subsequently increased. High-value areas are primarily located in the reservoir’s centre and eastern sections, whereas low-value areas are mostly found in the western section. Soil conservation service values initially declined and later climbed. The TGRA’s carbon storage services have in-creased yearly, from 552.64 g/m2 in 2000 to 615.92 g/m2 in 2020. (2) In the ecological protection scenario, carbon storage and soil erosion increased compared to the ecosystem services in 2020. The ecological system service benefits are greater when compared to the natural development scenario. (3) The four ESs show positive spatial correlations across all three scenarios, and local spatial au-tocorrelation analysis findings demonstrate that carbon storage, water yield, and habitat quality have comparable spatial distributions across all three scenarios. To some extent, high-value areas for water conservation, soil retention, carbon storage, and habitat quality overlap.",Not About Sufficiency
"An Equality-Based Approach to Analysing the Global Food System's Fair Share, Overshoot, and Responsibility for Exceeding the Climate Change Planetary Boundary","The climate catastrophe is being caused by human effects on earth system processes that are surpassing several planetary boundaries.

During 1990−2018, the annual fair share, overshoot of emissions, and collective historical responsibility in the world of each country were assessed. There was a 22.52% increase in overshooting of GHG emissions from the global food system, starting in 1990. A group of 15 countries, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, and the U.S.A., were responsible for >67% of global overshoot.

From alleviating symptoms to eradicating poverty,"Poverty and environmental degradation are consequences of our current social and economic arrangements, and cannot be solved in isolation from each other or from national and global economic structures. Current efforts to alleviate symptoms are not sufficient to break cycles of increasing poverty, reduced consumption, decreasing production and decreasing employment. Governments and international financial institutions have important roles, and responsibilities for directing economic processes and regulating markets to bear the costs of the regeneration of human and physical resources. In most developing countries, deterioration of available biomass resources and increasing human and animal pressure on remaining resources have resulted in serious environmental consequences: deforestation, soil erosion, falling water tables and decreased agricultural productivity. Improving the quality and availability of energy for cooking to women of low-income households is essential both to achieve sustainable standards of living and to regain a sustainable level of natural resource use. -from Author",Not About Sufficiency

Modelling pollination maps in agroecosystems of a Chilean biodiversity hotspot,"Wild pollinators play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems and sustaining agricultural productivity. However, their survival is at risk due to habitat loss and land use changes, exacerbating the ongoing biodiversity crisis, and jeopardising global food security. We assessed the contribution of native vegetation cover to pollination and avocado crop yield by modelling the abundance of native bees and the pollination services they provide in agroecosystems of the Aconcagua River basin in Central Chile. This region stands as a critical biodiversity hotspot, currently confronted with the challenge of land use change, especially due to the expansion of avocado (Persea americana Mill.) monocultures. Our findings revealed a clear relationship between native bee abundance, pollination services, and avocado yield as a function of natural vegetation cover surrounding the crops. Areas with a higher proportion of native vegetation exhibited the most abundant supply of pollination services, while within avocado crops show lower levels of pollination support. A spatial mismatch between supply and demand for pollination revealed by our results indicates that agricultural expansion threatens native pollinators and agricultural yield production in this region. The development of pollination maps has been proposed as a strategic tool to guide land-use planning decisions within agricultural landscapes. Prioritizing the conservation of native vegetation or adopting biodiversity-friendly practices can help mitigate the effects of agricultural expansion on wild pollinators. These strategies are vital for safeguarding biodiversity, ensuring food security, and mitigating the far-reaching impacts of the current biodiversity crisis.",Not About Sufficiency
Landscape sustainability science (II): core questions and key approaches,"Context A background assumption of landscape approaches is that some landscape patterns are more sustainable than others, and thus searching for these patterns should be a unifying theme for all landscape-related studies. We know much about biodiversity, ecosystems, and human wellbeing in our landscapes, but much less about how their interactions influence, and are influenced by, landscape patterns. To help fill this knowledge gap, landscape sustainability science (LSS) has emerged. However, the core research questions and key approaches of this new field still need to be systematically articulated. Objectives The main objectives of this paper were: (1) to propose a set of core research questions for LSS, and (2) to identify key cross-disciplinary approaches that can help address these questions. Methods I took a qualitative and subjective approach to review and synthesize the literature relevant to landscape sustainability, based on which I developed core questions and identified key cross-disciplinary approaches. Results Eight core questions were proposed to focus on understanding the relationships among landscape pattern, biodiversity, ecosystem function, ecosystem services, and human wellbeing, assessing the impacts of environmental and socio-institutional changes on these relationships, and fusing knowledge and action through landscape design/planning and governance processes. Ten inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches were identified, and their key characteristics were discussed in relation to landscape sustainability. Conclusions LSS has emerged as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research field that aims to understand and improve sustainability by focusing on landscape scales, while considering local and global scales in the same time. To advance LSS, future research not only needs to emphasize the relationships among landscape pattern, ecosystem services, and human wellbeing, but also to proactively integrate complementary approaches across natural and social sciences. Landscape sustainability is inevitably connected to the broader regional and global context; but if global sustainability is to be achieved, our landscapes must be sustained first.

Land use change and soil organic carbon dynamics,"Historically, soils have lost 40-90 Pg carbon (C) globally through cultivation and disturbance with current rates of C loss due to land use change of about 1.6 +/- 0.8 Pg C y(-1), mainly in the tropics. Since soils contain more than twice the C found in the atmosphere, loss of C from soils can have a significant effect of atmospheric CO2 concentration, and thereby on climate. Halting land-use conversion would be an effective mechanism to reduce soil C losses, but with a growing population and changing dietary preferences in the developing world, more land is likely to be required for agriculture. Maximizing the productivity of existing agricultural land and applying best management practices to that land would slow the loss of, or is some cases restore, soil C. There are, however, many barriers to implementing best management practices, the most significant of which in developing countries are driven by poverty. Management practices that also improve food security and profitability are most likely to be adopted. Soil C management needs to considered within a broader framework of sustainable development. Policies to encourage fair trade, reduced subsidies for agriculture in developed countries and less onerous interest on loans and foreign debt would encourage sustainable development, which in turn would encourage the adoption of successful soil C management in developing countries. If soil management is to be used to help address the problem of global warming, priority needs to be given to implementing such policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Designing without nature: Unsewered residential development in rural Wisconsin,"In the classic environmental planning book, Design with Nature, McHarg (1969) demonstrated a land use planning process that employed multiple layers of geocoded data.

Nevertheless, improvements in transportation infrastructure, combined with an assortment of technological advances, have greatly diminished the constraining effects of distance and physiography on land use spatial patterns. In the United States, for example, advances in wastewater management technology have decreased the influence of soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and depth to water table on residential development locational decisions.

Transformation of Solid Waste Management in China: Moving towards Sustainability through Digitalization-Based Circular Economy,"In China, environmental pollution due to municipal solid waste (MSW) over-generation is one of the country’s priority concerns. The increasing volume and complexity of the waste poses serious risks to the environment and public health. Currently, the annual growth of MSW generation is estimated to be approximately 8–10% and will increase to 323 million metric tons (Mt) by 2030. Based on the secondary data collected from a literature survey, this article critically evaluates the recent progress of MSW management (MSWM) in China and offers new insights into the waste sector in the era of Industry 4.0. This helps decision makers in China to plan a smooth transition nationwide to a circular economy (CE) in the waste sector. It is evident that digitalization is a driving force for China to move towards low-carbon development strategies within the framework of CE. Through digitalization, the waste sector has promoted prevention, reduction, reuse, and recycling (3Rs) of waste before waste disposal in landfills. A proper implementation of digitalization-based waste recycling has contributed to an efficient cooperation between the government and private sector, increased job opportunities, and promoted the conservation of resources.

In pursuit of this issue, this study empirically investigates the effects in outcome variable CO2 provoked by independent variables governance, technological innovation, renewable energy, economic growth, and economic policy uncertainty in APEC economies. The APEC region accounts for 60% of global emissions, 62% of world GDP, 48% of global trade and contribute 8.7% renewable energy annually. A dynamic panel PMG-ARDL model is applied under the assumption of maximum likelihood estimation with DH causality and CS-ARDL for the period of 1996–2020. Our empirical results confirm that governance, technology innovation, and transitional energy have significant and positive effect to mitigate CO2 emissions. The region needs to design policy mechanisms supportive to promote institutional quality, enhances transparency, ensure political stability and rule of law. It develops the infrastructure that ensures the adaptation of technology innovations, promotes green growth, improves energy efficiency, and implements carbon pricing mechanism. Economic policy uncertainty has insignificant and positive effects on environmental degradation. The findings show that governance, technological development, and transitional energy have an essential role to mitigate CO2 emissions and achieve sustainable development.

"Integrating Data Envelopment Analysis and Machine Learning Approaches for Energy Optimization, Decreased Carbon Footprints, and Wheat Yield Prediction Across North-Western India","An accurate, timely and large-scale yield prediction is considered critically important to frame policies to mitigate climate change risks and for ensured food security. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), being a major cereal grain crop of north-western India, has been highly energy intensive with large emissions of greenhouse gases, affecting ecosystems’ sustainability. We therefore, performed energy optimization in wheat for enhanced ecosystems’ resilience and carbon (C) sustainability, while predicting yields of 120 intensive wheat production systems across north-western India. An integrated approach of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning (ML) models was applied for energy optimization and accurate yield prediction. After optimization of energy input in wheat production, 8 different ML models of variable complexity viz. linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LAR), elastic net regression (ENR), decision tree regression (DT), random forest regression (RF), gradient boosting regression (GB) and support vector regression (SVR) were applied and evaluated statistically for accurate prediction of wheat yields of studied decision making units (DMUs). These results revealed that wheat ecosystems have a high total input energy (EI) of 24.7 GJ ha−1, which comprises ~46.5% share of direct and 53.5% of indirect energy sources. The non-renewable energy input was ~3.9 times higher than the renewable energy. The total C equivalent emissions of 1815.7 kg CO2e ha−1 comprised the highest share of chemical fertilizers (~49.8%), and exhibited a linear significant relationship with EI (R2 = 0.8117**; p< 0.01). Nitrogenous fertilizers application contributes ~90.1% towards total fertilizer related energy input in wheat production. The net global warming potential of 2.30 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 was estimated which resulted in yield scaled emissions (i.e., greenhouse gases intensity) of 0.34 kg CO2e kg−1 wheat grain yield. The DEA-based benchmarking showed that the technical efficiency (TE) score of 79 DMUs was < 1.00, elucidated ~65% DMUs as energy inefficient. The average (n = 120) TE score of 0.92 illustrates energy saving possibility of 2464.6 MJ ha−1 (~8% of EI), mostly via efficient fertilizer (54.4%) and irrigation water management (11.6%). The 1:1 (x = y) correspondence analysis implies that DT, GB, and RF models can accurately predict wheat productivity with significantly higher R2 values of 0.998** (p < 0.01), 0.950** (p< 0.01), and 0.832* (p< 0.05), respectively. These results underpin overwhelming significance of DEA-based energy optimization for wheat ecosystems, which helps reduce the energy and C footprints for sustainable and cleaner production. Nonetheless, DT, GB, and RF models outperformed in yield prediction with the lowest root mean square error and normalized mean square error, but the highest Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and index of agreement. Therefore, DEA-based benchmarking has significant energy saving potential, while DT, GB, and RF models have highly accurate wheat yield prediction abilities for north-western India.",Not About Sufficiency
US energy policy Impact of the Reagan Administration,"After three years in power, the Reagan Administration has been able to reverse much of the US federal government's energy policy measures that had occurred since 1973, particularly the build-up that took place during the Carter presidency. Another change is a repudiation of social equity concerns, which were an important part of the energy policies of the Nixon, Ford and Carter presidencies. Instead of using government to direct energy policy, the Reagan Administration has stressed the pre-eminence of the private sector. One exception is nuclear energy, which the Administration strongly supports. While the Reagan policies implemented have increased economic efficiency and reduced federal-related budgets and staffs, they have caused environmental degradation and hardship on the poor. Yet their greatest implication is that of a nation less well prepared to handle a severe energy shortage. The Administration believes this is not a problem, based on its optimistic expectations of the extent of untapped resources worldwide and the resilience of the free market. © 1984.",Not About Sufficiency
FEATURES OF ACCOUNTING FOR LAND IN THE CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,"In today's globalized society, it is becoming more and more necessary to include sustainable development ideas in accounting methods. The main concepts of land accounting within the context of sustainable development are covered in detail in this abstract. Sustainable development requires an accounting methodology that goes beyond typical financial measurements since it is defined by the balance of economic, social, and environmental components. We examine how social responsibility, resource efficiency, carbon footprint calculations, environmental impact assessments, and resource efficiency are all taken into account when accounting for land in the framework of sustainable development. Accounting helps to foster responsibility, openness, and well-informed choices when it comes to managing and investing in real estate. In addition, it draws attention to new developments in sustainable land accounting, such as the implementation of global frameworks and standards like the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Global Reporting Initiative (СЕ). The significance of incorporating sustainability principles into land accounting practices to address the issues of climate change, resource depletion, and social equity.

"Karst landscapes of China: patterns, ecosystem processes and services","Context The karst region of southwestern China, one of the largest continuous karsts in the world, is known for its unique landscapes and rich biodiversity. This region has suffered severe environmental degradation (e.g., vegetation cover loss, soil erosion and biodiversity loss). In recent decades, Chinese governments at different levels have initiated several ecological programs (e.g., Green for Grain, Mountain Closure) to restore the degraded environment and to alleviate poverty. Objectives This study summarizes landscape studies of karst landscapes patterns, their dynamics and interactions among landscape pattern, hydrological processes and ecosystem services (ES). Methods We conducted a systematic literature review of science and land use policy to identify knowledge gaps and recommend future research and policy directions. Results Karst landscapes have experienced rapid turnover in recent decades due largely to the overlap of intense human activity on the fragile karst ecosystems. Many studies have comprehensively examined hydrology, soil processes and ecosystem services (ES) and their relationships with landscape pattern. Most of these studies have found that karst ecosystems recover with improved ES. However, the importance of epikarst in hydrological and soil processes, intense anthropogenic disturbance and landscape heterogeneity in landscape models remains elusive. Conclusions Future research should focus on in-depth examination and modelling of karst specific hydrological and soil processes, investigating relationships between climatic change, landscape change, ecological processes, and region-specific ES assessments. Results from such research should provide the necessary scientific support for a comprehensive, national karst rocky desertification treatment project (Stage II) and poverty alleviation initiatives.",Not About Sufficiency

Integration of biodiversity conservation in tropical forest and economic development of local communities,"Quantification of economic contribution of all forest products is a primary requirement for the integration of biodiversity conservation and economic development of local communities. A methodology for quantification of the contribution of all non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is suggested, and applied to a minuscule sample of seven villages in India for illustrative purposes. A comparative analysis of such contributions of NTFPs in two major types of forest cover, Teak (Tectona grandis) and Sal (Shorea robusta) has been made. The role of NTFPs has been evaluated in terms of three measures of economic development: (i) share in household income, (ii) income distribution, and (iii) mitigation of uncertainties of agricultural income stream due to random fluctuations in weather conditions. A basic strategy for the integration of biodiversity conservation and economic development of local communities, based on socio-economic conditions of the community and silvicultural requirements of the forest resources, is suggested. © 1997 by The Haworih Press, Inc.

Development of AIM (Asian-Pacific Integrated Model) for coping with global warming,"The need to respond to climate changes is now a matter of common recognition throughout the world. After several years of negotiations, agreement was reached on the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 in Japan. The Protocol is regarded as an important step toward meeting the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This paper discusses the costs of implementing the Protocol under a variety of assumptions. The AIM model is used to simulate post-Kyoto scenarios. It is found that it is possible to decrease CO2 emissions without scaling back productive activity or reducing living standards in Japan. However, if one relies on the market mechanism alone, this will not occur. Our analysis clearly shows that it is necessary to introduce new policy measures such as a carbon tax and increased subsidies for introducing energy-saving technologies.",Not About Sufficiency
JUST TRANSITIONS,"The transition to a low-carbon society will have winners and losers as the costs and benefits of decarbonization fall unevenly on different communities. This potential collateral damage has prompted calls for a ""just transition"" to a green economy. While the term, ""just transition,"" is increasingly prevalent in the public discourse, it remains under-discussed and poorly defined in legal literature, preventing it from helping catalyze fair decarbonization. This Article seeks to define the term, test its validity, and articulate its relationship with law so the idea can meet its potential. The Article is the first to disambiguate and assess two main rhetorical usages of ""just transition."" I argue that legal scholars should recognize it as a term of art that evolved in the labor movement, first known as a ""superfund for workers."" In the climate change context, I therefore define a just transition as the principle of easing the burden decarbonization poses to those who depend on high-carbon industries. This definition provides clarity and can help law engage with fields that already recognize just transitions as a labor concept. I argue further that the labor-driven just transition concept is both justified and essential in light of today's deep political polarization and ""jobs-versus-environment"" tensions. First, it can incorporate much-needed economic equity considerations into environmental decisionmaking. Second, it can inform a modernized alternative to the environmental law apparatus, which must evolve to transcend disciplines. Third, it offers an avenue for climate reform through coalition-building between labor and environmental interests. I offer guidance for effectuating the principle by synthesizing instances of its embodiment in law in the Trade Act of 1974 (assisting manufacturing communities), the President's Northwest Forest Plan (assisting timber communities), the Tobacco Transition Payment Program (assisting tobacco farmers), and the POWER Initiative (assisting coal communities), among other examples.",Not About Sufficiency
Just Transition: A whole-systems approach to decarbonisation,"Transition to a post-carbon economy implies changes that are both far-reaching and unprecedented. The notion that a decarbonization transition must encompass multiple forms of justice is gaining ground. In response, the concept of Just Transition has become ever more popular - and confusion about its meaning ever greater. We argue in this paper that the term Just Transition needs a rigorous updating to develop its full conceptual power for the analysis and evaluation of the rapid and extensive energy transitions already underway. After reviewing the different uses of Just Transition in practice and scholarship, we propose that the term be used as an analytical concept for an ongoing process of transition. The Just Transition concept can provide an integrated, whole-system perspective on justice (procedural, distributive, recognition, and restorative) that can help in identifying systemic solutions to address environmental and socio-economic concerns. This would differ from reductionist approaches that derive from legacy silo-sectoral or technologically driven approaches; these too often overlook negative side-effects and wider justice implications of reorganizing economic practice. An examination of COVID-19 pandemic responses illustrates our operationalization of the Just Transition concept, highlighting the importance of designing whole-system policies that are equitable, as well as the pitfalls of pursuing a narrow sectoral approach. Taking seriously the implications of complex systems with hard-to-predict effects also has concrete implications for policy interventions at all levels of governance. In particular, we highlight the importance of attending to multiple social inequalities for ensuring the resilience of whole-system decarbonization in the face of instability, unpredictability, and unprecedented change. Key policy insights The transition to net-zero will be neither sustainable nor credible if it creates or worsens social inequalities; a backlash is likely if the transition is not perceived to be just. Pathways forward may only emerge through observation, experimentation, and experience. A range of policy tools exist to address Just Transition concerns. These include addressing social and environmental aspects of economic policy; making sure that interventions are adapted to local contexts; building democratic engagement platforms; and open and transparent communication. Job creation does not guarantee just outcomes, as justice goes beyond employment conditions.",Not About Sufficiency
Just transition: A conceptual review,"The growing attention paid to the idea of a just transition away from the incumbent fossil fuel energy paradigm has led scholars to devise diverse definitions, understandings, and viewpoints of the term. This review seeks to clarify the different perspectives surrounding the concept, to consolidate knowledge, and to provide a concise account of current debates in the literature as well as a research agenda. It identifies five themes around which the concept has been discussed: (1) just transition as a labor-oriented concept, (2) just transition as an integrated framework for justice, (3) just transition as a theory of socio-technical transition, (4) just transition as a governance strategy, and (5) just transition as public perception. Overall, this review suggests that the literature on just transition employs rich theoretical and empirical insights from various disciplines yet contains several gaps. Specifically, it argues that the literature would benefit from more empirical studies rooted in practice, more discussion on the relationship between different concepts of just transition, an expansion of geographical scope to include developing countries and non-democratic regimes, and more attention to power dynamics in just transition.",Not About Sufficiency
Just transition boundaries: Clarifying the meaning of just transition,"The rapid expansion of the public discussion and research on just transition implies the risk of watering down either justice or the (eco-)socio-technical transition itself. We create a theoretical notion of just transition boundaries and propose it to help consider non-negotiable limits to just transition discourse and make sense of negotiations within such limits. Just transition boundaries are comprised of ecological and social boundaries. They determine that just transition-processes must bring societies effectively within the safety thresholds of the two most critical planetary boundaries, climate change and biodiversity loss, and must do that by means and supportive measures that protect vulnerable groups from falling or getting stuck below social minimums in those processes. Boundaries leave room for plural values and visions for realizing transitions and remaining within safe thresholds in community-specific conditions. Context-specific additions to what just transition should cover are possible insofar as they do not contradict or risk just transition boundaries. In addition to justifying and conceptualizing just transition boundaries, we reflect on its implications for policymaking and research.",Not About Sufficiency
'just sustainability': the emerging discourse of environmental justice in Britain?,"Environmental justice is both a vocabulary for political opportunity, mobilization and action, and a policy principle to guide public decision making.

However, as the environmental justice discourse has matured, it has become increasingly evident that it should play a role in the wider agendas for sustainable development and social inclusion. The links between sustainability and environmental justice are becoming clearer and more widely understood in the UK by NGOs and government alike, and it is the potential synergy between these two discourses which is the focus of this paper.

Climate policies can widen these inequalities as well as mitigate them, depending on their design. Decarbonization of the US electricity sector illustrates these possibilities. A strategy narrowly focused on carbon reduction alone is likely in some regions to increase disparities in exposure to localized co-pollutants emitted by fossil fuel combustion and, in some cases, to increase exposure in absolute terms. Strategies that in addition explicitly mandate improvements in air quality, both overall and specifically for frontline communities, can couple decarbonization with remediation of environmental inequalities and broad-based gains in public health.",Not About Sufficiency

Circular economy advocates for a shift in production, consumption and waste management towards a regenerative model that optimises resource efficiency and reduces environmental harm. Despite their differing origins and focuses, both frameworks share a common goal of promoting sustainable livelihoods, adapting to new technologies, and embracing the energy transition. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the thematic convergence and potential for synergy between just transition and circular economy.

Just by design: exploring justice as a multidimensional concept in US circular economy discourse,"Circular economies are often framed as addressing a trio of problems: environmental degradation, economic stagnation, and social ills, broadly defined.

Drawing on data generated from focus groups with circular economy experts and a content analysis of US-based governmental, NGO, and business literature on circular economies, we explore whether and how justice emerges in circular economy discourse. We explore the narratives that these actors use to describe justice, and the barriers they see in achieving just and inclusive circular economies. We aim to identify the ways in which social justice is defined and discussed - or not - by the actors who seem to be most actively pushing for a circular economy (CE). Our work addresses the critical need to articulate clearly what it is we mean by social justice in relation to the CE. For if the CE is to contribute to sustainable social transformations, justice must be more than a buzzword - the CE must be just by design.",Not About Sufficiency

Environment and health as a driver of transformation,"As technology progresses, social inequality grows, the gap widens, and the environment continues to suffer. Furthermore, the social environment in societies is “ruffled” and does not appear to be constructive toward well-being. New inequalities are emerging in the availability of technology, climate change, education. The achievement reports on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also point out to the need of reviewing individual indicators.The UN Human Development Report estimates that children in highly developed countries have a 55% chance of obtaining high education, as opposed to children born in underdeveloped countries where only 3% of them have a chance of high education. In underdeveloped countries, according to the UN data, 17% of them die by the age of 20, while in developed countries this is 1%. The gap in the opportunities of young people in different living environments is quite pronounced nowadays. If this process does not get stopped, it can be irreversible.The directions of transformation necessary to achieve the SDGs, while respecting the principles of equality, quality of life preservation and improvement, are divided into six groups. Transformations should aim at: an educated workforce, an innovative economy, gender equality and social protection, health and wellbeing for all, universal health care and support for healthy lifestyles. Transformation is also a prerequisite for: climate neutrality, circular economy, decarbonisation, renewable energy and industrial development. Sustainable agriculture and food production, conservation and restoration of natural resources, as well as sustainable, green urban environments and support for small communities also require radical changes.

Carbon dioxide removal and net zero emissions in Africa: an integrated assessment modelling based on three different land-based negative emission solutions,"As the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5 °C rapidly diminishes, it is clear that, besides decarbonization, the world will need to remove 100–1000 GtCO2 from the atmosphere by the end of the century. Yet, Africa, where many carbon removal schemes are planned, remains a ‘blindspot’ in existing studies. There is limited understanding of the trade-offs and synergies associated with carbon removal within Africa’s energy-land-water system. To address this research gap, we model a stylized net-zero emissions (NZEs) in Africa by 2050, with focus on three land-based biological carbon removal approaches: afforestation/reforestation (AR), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and biochar. We find that by 2050, the total gross carbon removal is projected to reach 1.2 GtCO2 yr−1 when all three carbon removal approaches are available, and 0.5 GtCO2 yr−1 when Africa relies solely on AR. Pursuing NZE with only AR or AR alongside biochar in Africa would be the most expensive mitigation option but they lead to the lowest residual fossil fuel and industry CO2 emissions. An NZE by 2050 in Africa could reduce cropland by 30%–40% from 2020 to 2050, depending on the carbon dioxide removal deployment strategy adopted. Southern Africa would be particularly affected, facing significant challenges in balancing food security with climate goals. The highest increase in staple food prices will occur under AR only, while the availability of AR-BECCS-biochar produces the lowest rise in staple food prices.

"Non-invasive home ventilation in patients over 75 years of age: Tolerance, compliance, and impact on quality of life","The adequacy of domiciliary non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIHV) for hypercapnic restrictive pulmonary disease in patients aged 75 years or above has been questioned, because of a lower life expectancy, a higher risk of neuropsychological impairment and a lower potential for adapting to NIHV. This study aims to illustrate that the use of NIHV is possible and efficient in this age group. In our referral area, all patients under NIHV have been included in a database since 1994; at the end of 1996, all patients in whom NIHV had been initiated at age 75 years or above were studied. We performed a cross-sectional study of six patients (two men, four women, age: 79 ± 3 years at time of study) who had been under NIHV for 31 ± 17 months. Patients underwent pulmonary function testing, assessment of respiratory muscle strength, physical disability and neuropsychological performance, tolerance and compliance to NIHV, and heath-related quality of life (SF-36, St. George Respiratory Questionnaire: SGRQ). Hospitalization rates were recorded for the year prior and the 2 yr following initiation of NIHV. By the time of the study, all patients showed improved arterial blood gases when compared to values before NIHV (PaCO2: 46 ± 9 vs 66 ± 10 mmHg, P = 0.04). Patients adapted well to NIHV, with minor side-effects and an average daily use of ventilator of 10.5 ± 2 h. None of the patients showed signs of emotional disturbance. SF-36 scores for mental health, subjective well-being and vitality, or social functioning, did not differ from that of age-matched controls. SGRQ scores were similar to those published for younger patients under NIHV. Use of health care facilities was similar to that of younger patients under NIHV; hospitalization rates decreased significantly after initiating NIHV (40 ± 31 days for year before NIHV, vs 13 ± 14 days and 0.8 ± 0.4 days for the 2 yr following NIHV, P = 0.02). Age above 75 years should not be considered per se as a contraindication to NIHV in patients with well-accepted indications for this treatment.

"Energy transition versus energy poverty in post-mining regions. Case Study Poland, Greece, and Bulgaria","The European Union’s primary goal is to attain climate neutrality by 2050, aiming for an economy with zero net greenhouse gas emissions. This objective is a core element of the European Green Deal and aligns seamlessly with the EU’s commitment to global climate action as articulated in the Paris Agreement. It is crucial to emphasize that the transition to sustainable energy carries significant risks for households experiencing energy poverty, particularly impacting underdeveloped regions and vulnerable social groups. Acknowledging this context is imperative to prevent further marginalization of the energy poor during a just transition. Effectively addressing energy poverty requires a combination of strategies and collaborative efforts at local, national, and global levels. The focus should be on renewable energy sources and decentralized solutions, such as home solar systems and mini-grids, providing a means to electrify remote and isolated areas without the need for extensive grid infrastructure. The central thesis of this paper posits that the energy transition may exacerbate the issue of energy poverty, particularly in post-mining regions. The study delves into various energy transition models, specifically examining Poland, Greece, and Bulgaria. To identify potentially vulnerable populations in these countries, the paper analyses data related to individuals at risk of poverty or social exclusion, as well as the long-term unemployment rate categorized by gender. Research indicates that potentially vulnerable customers are most likely to be identified in Bulgaria, where 32.1% of the population was at risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2020, and the long-term unemployment rate was 2.3% in the same year. In Greece, 28.8% of the population faced the risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2020, with a long-term unemployment rate of 10.9%.

Is there a trade-off between human well-being and ecological footprint in European countries?,"Human development, which encompasses aspects such as health, education, standard of living, and general wellbeing, is intrinsically linked to environmental sustainability. Studying the trade-off between these two aspects helps ensure that current needs are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The present study aims to understand whether there is a trade-off between the Ecological Footprint (EF) and the Human Development Index (HDI), using data from 42 European countries from 2006 to 2018. Other variables were also employed (Financial Development Index, Globalization Index, Human Freedom Index, Urban Population, Biocapacity, Renewable Energy) in two main models, through several econometric tests (Interactive Fixed Effects, Common Correlated Effect Mean Group). Other models were estimated for robustness checks. It is concluded that there is a trade-off between the EF and the HDI. This leads to problems when trying to achieve human well-being and environmental sustainability simultaneously. This study is innovative as the relationship between human development and environmental degradation has not been analyzed using these two variables for European countries. Understanding the relationship between human development and EF is fundamental to developing effective policies. It is important to adopt integrated approaches that consider social, economic, and environmental aspects.",Not About Sufficiency

Is it possible to achieve a good life for all within planetary boundaries?,"The safe and just space framework devised by Raworth calls for the world's nations to achieve key minimum thresholds in social welfare while remaining within planetary boundaries. Using data on social and biophysical indicators provided by O'Neill etal., this paper argues that it is theoretically possible to achieve a good life for all within planetary boundaries in poor nations by building on existing exemplary models and by adopting fairer distributive policies. However, the additional biophysical pressure that this entails at a global level requires that rich nations dramatically reduce their biophysical footprints by 40-50%. Extant empirical studies suggest that this degree of reduction is unlikely to be achieved solely through efforts to decouple GDP growth from environmental impact, even under highly optimistic conditions. Therefore, for rich nations to fit within the boundaries of the safe and just space will require that they abandon growth as a policy objective and shift to post-capitalist economic models.",Not About Sufficiency
Is all inequality reduction equal? Understanding motivations and mechanisms for socio-economic inequality reduction in economic narratives of climate change mitigation,"In descriptions of a just transition to a sustainable future, ensuring a decent quality of life whilst remaining within planetary boundaries are often dual central aims. However, at present no country is moving in the right direction at the necessary speed to achieve this. In response, the need to reduce socio-economic inequality is increasingly highlighted in climate mitigation proposals, spanning a broad range of economic narratives of climate change mitigation, including Green Growth, Green New Deal, Post-Growth and Degrowth proposals. Despite broad support within sustainability transition literature for inequality reduction, the relationship between inequality and planetary boundaries is complex and understudied, particularly with regards to the climate impact economic inequality reduction may have in these divergent economic policy narratives. Through a structured integrative review of the academic literature that discusses inequality reduction alongside these narratives, this paper unpicks the motivations for and mechanisms through which socio-economic inequality reduction may be achieved. Whilst the narratives share the goal of achieving inequality reduction, the purposes for, mechanisms through which inequality reduction is to be achieved, and conviction through which inequality reduction is pursued is often distinct. It is argued that these differences may result in divergent climate impacts of ensuring decent living standards under each economic future. Despite this potential, none of the narratives offer investigation to these impacts, indicating the need for further empirical investigation of this important tension in climate change mitigation research.",Not About Sufficiency
"Addressing hardship and climate change: Citizens' perceptions of costs of living, social inequalities and priorities for policy","In the wake of rising energy prices and the cost of living crisis, some have claimed that climate policies are at odds with citizens' more pressing everyday living concerns. Critics challenge these simplifying narratives that shorter term economic and social wellbeing priorities and ‘longer term’ decarbonization policies are in tension with one another and argue that effective policies must treat them as interconnected. Evidence regarding how citizens think about climate policy mostly focus on policy acceptability, highlighting the role of perceptions of effectiveness and fairness, but there is a quite limited conceptualization of contexts of social inequality, and even more limited engagement with the views of marginalized groups whose buy‐in is seen as crucial for effective net zero transitions. This paper reviews the evidence and analyses new data from a small exploratory study with citizens from low income and marginalized backgrounds. In group discussions several participants emphasized the importance of tackling both social hardships and climate priorities, seen by some as interlinked. Further, many described wider societal unfairness relating to experiences of poverty, exploitation, a lack of voice or even recognition and a keen sense of disconnect between politics and their own everyday concerns and lived experiences. I argue that climate policy making should engage more fully with contexts of social inequality and that social wellbeing and systematic action on climate change need to be treated by policy makers and politicians as profoundly interlinked challenges.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable environment quality: moderating role of renewable energy consumption in service sector for selected HDR listed countries,"AbstractConsidering environmental deterioration, an emerging global problem, this study is aimed at determining the impact of the service sector economic activity on environmental quality from the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) perspective and finding ways to reduce the carbon impact of service sector within the EKC relationship. This study proposes that renewable energy intensity in the economy plays an important role in reducing carbon print of service sector. This study is based on secondary data from 1995 to 2021 for different development-wise categorized country groups leading to 115 countries, according to the Human Development Report (HDR) on the Human Development Index (HDI). Estimated results using panel feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) have confirmed inverted U-shaped for very high HDI and medium HDI and U-shaped EKC for low HDI countries. This study is instrumental in confirming the moderating role of renewable energy in the service sector EKC.

Investigation of environmental justice analysis in airport planning practice from 2000 to 2010,"Municipal airport owners and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regularly evaluate capacity and demand to decide if and when airports need more infrastructure. New infrastructure can alter the profile of noise, emissions, and land use, which may affect the quality of life for airport-adjacent communities. When the FAA and airport owners initiate infrastructure expansion, they must conduct environmental justice analysis to measure the distribution of negative externalities on nearby communities. This research investigates the environmental justice methodologies and narratives reported in planning documents for nineteen airport capacity expansions planned or deployed from 2000 to 2010 in the United States. The mixed-methods approach analyzes airport operations data, spatial demographic data, and planning artifacts to determine whether the environmental justice analyses were robust. This research proposes alternative metrics, the 'Risk of disproportionate impact' and 'Capacity strain', to further contextualize the presence of protected population groups alongside capacity needs. The main finding of the study is that the planning documents did not consistently detect environmental justice impacts, nor did they consistently confer importance to those impacts when high proportions of protected populations were detected. As a result, the social costs of collective airport expansion are unclear and likely underestimated. This study identifies two limitations that undermined the environmental justice analysis throughout the airport sample: (1) inconsistent methodological choices impeded the detection of impacts and, (2) narrative interpretations tended to 'null' the finding even when impacts were detected.",Not About Sufficiency
"Intersectionality and energy transitions: A review of gender, social equity and low-carbon energy","Transitions to low-carbon energy systems are essential to meeting global commitments to climate change mitigation. Yet ""greening"" energy systems may not make them any fairer, inclusive or just. In this paper, we review the academic literature to understand the state of knowledge on how diffusion of low-carbon technologies impacts gender and social equity in intersectional ways. Our findings indicate that renewable energy projects alone cannot achieve gender and social equity, as energy interventions do not automatically tackle the structural dynamics embedded within socio-cultural and socio-economic contexts. If existing power asymmetries related to access and resource distribution are not addressed early on, the same structural inequalities will simply be replicated and transferred over into new energy regimes.",Not About Sufficiency
"Integrating Land Use, Ecosystem Service, and Human Well-Being: A Systematic Review","Global change, population growth, and urbanization have been exerting a severe influence on the environment, including the social system and ecosystem. To find solutions based on nature, clarifying the complicated mechanisms and feedback among land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being, is increasingly crucial. However, the in-depth linkages among these three elements have not been clearly and systematically illustrated, present research paths have not been summarized well, and the future research trends on this topic have not been reasonably discussed. In this sense, the purpose of this paper is to provide an insight into how land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being are linked, as well as their relationships, interacting ways, applications in solving ecological and socioeconomic problems, and to reveal their future research trends. Here, we use a systematic literature review of the peer-reviewed literature to conclude the state of the art and the progress, emphasize the hotspot, and reveal the future trend of the nexus among the three aspects. Results show that (1) ecosystem services are generally altered by the changes in land use type, spatial pattern, and intensity; (2) the nexus among land use change, ecosystem services, and human well-being is usually used for supporting poverty alleviation, ecosystem health, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development; (3) future research on land use/land cover changes, ecosystem services, and human well-being should mainly focus on strengthening multiscale correlation, driving force analysis, the correlation among different group characteristics, land use types and ecosystem service preferences, and the impact of climate change on ecosystem services and human well-being.

Our study builds on conservation decision-making scholarship by analyzing the relationships between biodiversity priorities, social vulnerability, climate risks, and projected population growth in Texas to identify geographies that simultaneously support multiple goals. Drawing from publicly available datasets, we show the potential for existing conservation priorities to exacerbate the inequitable distribution of environmental goods and services, especially for lowerincome residents, communities of color, and socially vulnerable populations. Using bivariate local indicators of spatial autocorrelation, we demonstrate effective ways to avoid negative social impacts by identifying synergistic locations with high levels of social vulnerability and biodiverse landscapes. We overlay these locations with climate risks to further prioritize areas that could meet biodiversity, social vulnerability, and climate adaptation needs. Lastly, we consider how future population growth may inform the urgency of conservation activities given potential development pressures. Our study contributes to academic and policy debates seeking to jointly address biodiversity conservation, climate change, and environmental justice concerns.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating Environmental Impact Assessment within Kuwait Master Plans as a Tool for Human and Ecological Risk Control,"Although it was claimed that the Kuwait Master Plans have helped guide the development in Kuwait from a small mud brick town of 150,000 inhabitants to today's modern metropolis of about 3 million inhabitants, this article argues that the implementation of the first plan in 1952 planted the seeds of human and ecological risk problems in Kuwait, which were intensified later in the 1960s and 1970s. As the latest 2007 Master Plan comprises major development projects, which could certainly have adverse ecological impacts on the environment and human well-being, this article highlights the importance of integrating environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the development projects within the Master Plan as a tool for sustainable development and as an assessment of human and ecological risks before the implementation of such projects. According to the current status, the level of collaboration among the concerned organizations responsible for preparing the Master Plans and conducting the EIA is behind the ambition. This article recommends setting out documented environmental criteria for land use planning and major development projects implementation, so as to control pollution and prevent any environmental change that might impair the public's health or influence future ecological stability.",Not About Sufficiency
"Integrating Environmental, Social, and Economic Dimensions to Monitor Sustainability in the G20 Countries","Several regions have struggled to define and implement strategic priorities to ensure resource supply security and environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The circular economy is gaining more and more importance as one of the forms of transition towards a sustainable future that integrates, in a balanced way, economic performance, social inclusion, and environmental resilience, for the benefit of current and future generations. In light of the challenges of solving or avoiding future problems, the G20 bloc created proposals and action plans to support the transition towards a more circular economic model while at the same time fostering discussions on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to monitor and compare the performance of 19 countries in the G20 bloc (the 20th member is the European Union) from 2000 to 2020 to assess their progress toward environmental, economic, and social sustainability supported by the CE principles. To achieve this objective, the five sectors sustainability model was used and was supported by goal programming as a multicriteria analysis tool generating a synthetic sustainability indicator to assist decision making. The results showed that the countries with the best overall sustainable performance (environmental, economic, and social) in 2020 were Canada (which also occupied the best position in 2000), Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States, while Argentina, South Africa, India, Indonesia, and China showed lower sustainability. The results can serve as a reference for decision making by stakeholders in designing policies and incentives to encourage the adoption of the circular economy and boost economic development without compromising welfare or the environment.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating energy governance and environmental justice: Role of renewable energy,"Energy and Environmental Justice is a well-researched subject. Research points to close interactions among energy, economy, sustainability, and policy aspects that lead to several policy issues of energy governance and environmental justice. Renewable energy promotion and the transition to a low carbon economy in all nations necessitate the integration of the complex nature of energy governance and envi-ronmental justice issues and their interactions. For the integration, we present a Morphological Analysis framework consisting of 6 dimensions and 25 variants that can be effectively used by policymakers in different nations to guide their transition to a low carbon economy via renewable energy. Presently, we can observe that environmental justice is largely restricted to justice literature. However, a holistic study of environmental justice requires among others a renewed research focus on new energy gover-nance issues arising out of the concern to ensure justice globally all along by deploying renewable energy systems for the ""just "" transition to low carbon sources. We also highlight immediate research opportu-nities arising from the integration.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
"Integrating ecosystem services and human well-being into management practices: Insights from a mountain-basin area, China","The integration of ecosystem services and human well-being into local management and planning remains a challenge in mountain-basin areas. We described the spatial distribution of 8 ecosystem services and analyzed tradeoffs and synergies among them in 2005-2015 based on spatial data and statistical data. Using data from a questionnaire survey, we identified the perception of ecosystem services and assessed subjective well-being. We integrated ecosystem services and subjective well-being using a cluster analysis across townships in the Huailai mountain-basin area, located in a farming-pastoral area of China. Within the mountain-basin area, regulating services (carbon sequestration and soil retention), habitat quality and forest recreation were most represented in mountain areas, which had low levels of well-being. High provisioning services generally coincided with high well-being. From the perspectives of stakeholders, two provisioning services (crop and fruit) were perceived as important to well-being but not vulnerable, and four services (soil fertility, nature appreciation, carbon sequestration and fresh water) were critical. Five indicators in well-being (housing conditions, the public health system, natural hazard control, educational freedom and job freedom) were identified as important but not satisfied. Based on our findings, we developed a framework for integrating ecosystem services and human well-being into management practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating Circular Economy and Laudato Si': A Christian Framework for Sustainable Development and Environmental Stewardship,"The circular economy and Laudato Si' share a common vision for addressing environmental, ecological, and social challenges through sustainability, justice, and paradigm change. The circular economy moves beyond the linear ""take-make-dispose"" model by promoting resource efficiency, waste elimination, and the regeneration of natural systems. Similarly, Laudato Si' calls for integral ecology, recognizing the interconnectedness of environmental, social, economic, and cultural systems. Both emphasize practical actions, such as transitioning to renewable energy, promoting responsible waste management, and adopting regenerative agricultural practices to restore our ecosystems. Ethical consumption, simplicity, and moderation are central to both frameworks, encouraging shifts toward reuse, repair, and shared resources as common platforms to reduce overconsumption. Social justice remains a priority, with a focus on supporting marginalized populations unequally affected by ecological crises. Education and international cooperation are essential to achieving these goals, fostering ecological awareness, and coordinating policies to drive systemic change.

Integrating Air Quality and Public Health Benefits in US Decarbonization Strategies,"Research on air quality and human health ""co-benefits"" from climate mitigation strategies represents a growing area of policy-relevant scholarship. Compared to other aspects of climate and energy policy evaluation, however, there are still relatively few of these co-benefits analyses. This sparsity reflects a historical disconnect between research quantifying energy and climate, and research dealing with air quality and health. The air quality co-benefits of climate, clean energy, and transportation electrification policies are typically assessed with models spanning social, physical, chemical, and biological systems. This review article summarizes studies to date and presents methods used for these interdisciplinary analyses. Studies in the peer-reviewed literature (n = 26) have evaluated carbon pricing, renewable portfolio standards, energy efficiency, renewable energy deployment, and clean transportation. A number of major findings have emerged from these studies: [1] decarbonization strategies can reduce air pollution disproportionally on the most polluted days; [2] renewable energy deployment and climate policies offer the highest health and economic benefits in regions with greater reliance on coal generation; [3] monetized air quality health co-benefits can offset costs of climate policy implementation; [4] monetized co-benefits typically exceed the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of renewable energies; [5] Electric vehicle (EV) adoption generally improves air quality on peak pollution days, but can result in ozone dis-benefits in urban centers due to the titration of ozone with nitrogen oxides. Drawing from these published studies, we review the state of knowledge on climate co-benefits to air quality and health, identifying opportunities for policy action and further research.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrated Optimization of Sustainable Transportation and Inventory with Multiplayer Dynamic Game under Carbon Tax Policy,"Growth in environmental sustainability has prompted the logistics industry to seek sustainable development, and carbon tax policies are considered an effective approach to reducing carbon emissions. This study investigates the optimization of sustainable transportation and inventory under a carbon tax policy and explores effective methods for coordinating the interests of governments and enterprises. The results can provide insights into sustainable logistics for decision-making by enterprises and policy-making by governments. We first examine a Stackelberg game model and design an iterative solution to optimize sustainable transportation and inventory under the carbon tax policy. We then establish a three-stage dynamic game model to optimize the wholesale price, carbon tax rate, and proportion of sustainable investment shared by the government. Furthermore, we perform a simulation to identify the optimal solution of the three-stage game, and we compare the simulation results with a numerical example. The results indicate that a carbon tax policy can improve social welfare and the sustainability of transportation and inventory but could hinder corporate profits. An appropriate sustainable investment-sharing strategy could compensate for the shortcomings of the carbon tax policy and result in positive outcomes for governments and enterprises.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrated modeling of nature's role in human well-being: A research agenda,"Integrated assessment models that incorporate biodiversity and ecosystem services could be an important tool for improving our understanding of interconnected social-economic-ecological systems, and for analyzing how policy alternatives can shift future trajectories towards more sustainable development.

Inequality and sustainable consumption: bridging the gaps,"This article examines the potential for cross-fertilisation between the sustainable consumption (SC) scholarship and the environmental justice (EJ) scholarship.

Industrializing theories: A thematic analysis of conceptual frameworks and typologies for industrial sociotechnical change in a low-carbon future,"Decarbonizing industry represents a critical challenge, requiring massive technology up-scaling, accelerated investment, and substantial science-supported policy changes. Such broad challenges call for inputs from diverse disciplinary perspectives. In this paper we identify, analyze and synthesize theories and conceptual frameworks shaping industrial decarbonization research, with the aim of exploring those most relevant for understanding industrial sociotechnical change in a low-carbon future. We draw from an expert-guided process covering 71 years of academic literature to present 88 distinct theories connected to industrial decarbonization and change. Based on an expert review, a literature review, and thematic analysis, we identify eight families of perspectives: theories of sociotechnical transitions, innovation and diffusion, social equity and acceptance, space place and geography, organizational behavior and management, politics and governance, risk and communication, and industrial ecology and sociology. We analyze these theories in terms of their 'fit' to the topic of industrial decarbonization, with 25 theories identified as being core. The second part of the study delves more deeply into typologies of underlying focus, theoretical emphasis, scale and unit of analysis, temporality, and theoretical crossovers. We conclude with implications for synthesis and lacuna in theory selection. In doing so, we seek to broaden conceptual debates that often risk being narrowly discussed in silos, missing opportunities from cross-disciplinary pollination. We provide a toolkit for researchers to utilize when studying industrial decarbonization, decline, and change.

"Incorporating ""relative"" ecological impacts into human development evaluation: Planetary Boundaries-adjusted HDI","During the past 30 years, Human Development Index (HDI) has evolved into a widely accepted proxy of human development. Based on Strong Sustainability and Planetary Boundaries, this paper puts forward Planetary Boundaries-adjusted HDI (PB-HDI). The PB-HDI has made references to Planetary pressures-adjusted HDI proposed by the UNDP. Being simple, transparent and theoretically valid, the PB-HDI incorporates ""relative "" ecological impacts, i.e. ecological impacts beyond planetary boundaries, into human development evaluation. The PB-HDI is the product of adjusted HDI and Ecological Overshoot Index. The adjusted HDI employs Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth to measure medical and health levels and sets a threshold value of Gross National Income per capita; the Ecological Overshoot Index measures ""relative "" ecological impacts and is constructed by employing consumption-based CO2 emissions and Material Footprint. Being compatible with intragenerational and intergenerational equity, the PB-HDI advocates achieving higher levels of economic-social development within planetary boundaries. PB-HDI values and ranks of 142 countries in 2015 are different with those of the HDI by a large extent.

Inclusive place-based education for 'Just Sustainability',"This paper identifies an emerging commonality between the professional spheres of planning, education and social or community work constellating around the concept of sustainable development (SD). It explores the contested nature of the concept of SD giving rise to a wide variety of sometimes conflicting 'readings'. It then goes on to advocate a 'strong' reading of SD, namely 'Just Sustainability', which lays particular stress on 'social justice', 'environmental justice' and inclusion. This, in turn, is understood to require a form of education which is empowering and is referred to as 'Education for Just Sustainability' (EJS). A particular focus of such work is the empowerment of local communities to understand and take action in their home localities. Therefore, place-based education is presented as an orientation suited to progressing EJS. A number of illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the potential for such an educational approach. Finally, some concluding observations are made as to the potential and requirements for place-based EJS in the UK and other contexts.",Not About Sufficiency
Improving Eco-social Literacy Using Spanish Media Coverage of the EU's Clean Energy Strategy,"Sustainable Development Goals represent a collective effort to achieve a better future for the world. Specifically, a clean energy transition requires eco-social literacy to improve in relation to Sustainable Development Goal 7: to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Thus, it seems appropriate to clearly identify the key concepts that everyone should know in order to efficiently make the clean energy transition. The method employed in this study to introduce citizens to the topic has drawn on Spanish press coverage on clean energy over the last two years. MyNews data base, a digital archive of modern printed press in Spain, has provided us with access to 66 different journals to identify 'clean energy key words', and the information obtained has been cross-referenced with BBC web page information, the New York Post, Washington Post and various European Union and International Energy Agency reports, among others. Thus, it has been possible to observe how the European Union's (EU) is leader on environmental, technological, investment and employment actions on clean energy transition. The two key questions to collect main concepts from the press have been: has the socioeconomic effort been sufficient? And: what are the main challenges for a clean energy transition? The response has included reference to the latest EU regulations and the relevant emerging debates and controversies. The main themes that the press have addressed included the problem of renewable energy storage, how to obtain energy from what used to be waste (such as poultry manure or brine from the desalination of seawater), how to favour the circular economy, and other experimental initiatives, such as biopropane production and decarbonization in the tertiary sector (tourism and transport). This paper also asks whether clean energy can be a good option for decarbonization in the context of growing energy poverty.

"Imported palm oil for biofuels in the EU: Profitability, greenhouse gas emissions and social welfare effects","We examine the social desirability of renewable diesel production from imported palm oil in the EU when greenhouse gas emissions are taken into account. Using a partial market equilibrium model, we also study the sectoral social welfare effects of a biofuel policy consisting of a blend mandate in a small EU country (Finland), when palm oil based diesel is used to meet the mandated quota for biofuels. We develop a market equilibrium model for three cases: i) no biofuel policy, ii) biofuel policy consisting of socially optimal emission-based biofuel tax credit and iii) actual EU biofuel policy. Our results for the EU biofuel market, Southeast Asia and Finland show very little evidence that a large scale use of imported palm oil in diesel production in the EU can be justified by lower greenhouse gas emission costs. Cuts in emission costs may justify extensive production only if low or negative land-use change emissions result from oil palm cultivation and if the estimated per unit social costs of emissions are high. In contrast, the actual biofuel policies in the EU encourage the production of palm oil based diesel. Our results indicate that the sectoral social welfare effects of the actual biofuel policy in Finland may be negative and that if emissions decrease under actual biofuel policy, the emission abatement costs can be high regardless of the land use change emissions.

"Impact of renewable energy expansion policies on the economy, income distribution, and air pollution reduction","This study employs a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model to evaluate the consequences of renewable energy (RE) expansion policies in South Korea, focusing on their impact on the economy, income distribution, and air pollution reduction. It assumes a scenario in which RE generation constitutes 20% of the total electricity generation by 2030. Various scenarios are explored, including those with and without emission regulations and those considering increased productivity of RE technology. Key findings suggest that expanding RE policies stimulates labor demand and revitalizes upstream industries. However, its effectiveness depends on increasing the efficiency of RE technologies. Carbon regulation, such as emissions trading schemes, reduces greenhouse gases and air pollutants, with environmental benefits outweighing GDP reductions. It decreases income inequality, whereas policies to promote RE exacerbate it, requiring corrective measures.

Impact of poverty and income inequality on the ecological footprint in Asian developing economies: Assessment of Sustainable Development Goals,"Poverty, widening income inequality, and environmental degradation are very critical challenges to sustainable development while in the light of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), these challenges have been addressed in numerous past empirical studies. However, increasing environmental degradation is a big constraint in the path of sustainable development, poverty alleviation, and controlling income inequality as well. Hence, in this study, we empirically investigate the theoretically ambiguous and complex relationship between poverty, income inequality, and ecological footprint (EFP) for 18 Asian developing countries over the period 2006-2017. Empirical results obtained from the Driscoll-Kraay (D-K) standard error approach confirmed that poverty headcount contributing to environmental degradation in terms of EFP. Further, widening income inequality has a detrimental and harmful effect on the environment in Asian developing countries.

Impact of Environmental Policy Mix on Carbon Emission Reduction and Social Welfare: Scenario Simulation Based on Private Vehicle Trajectory Big Data,"Analyzing and investigating the impact of implementing an environmental policy mix on carbon emission from private cars and social welfare holds significant reference value. Firstly, based on vehicle trajectory big data, this paper employs reverse geocoding and artificial neural network models to predict carbon emissions from private cars in various provinces and cities in China. Secondly, by simulating different scenarios of carbon tax, carbon trading, and their policy mix, the propensity score matching model is constructed to explore the effects of the policy mix on carbon emission reduction from private cars and social welfare while conducting regional heterogeneity analysis. Finally, policy proposals are proposed to promote carbon emission reduction from private cars and enhance social welfare in China. The results indicate that the environmental policy mix has a significant positive impact on carbon emission reduction from private cars and social welfare. Furthermore, in the regional heterogeneity analysis, the implementation of the policy mix in eastern regions has a significant positive effect on both carbon emission reduction from private cars and social welfare, while in central and western regions, it shows a significant positive impact on social welfare but has no significant effect on carbon emission reduction in the private car sector.",Not About Sufficiency
Impact of carbon emission trading and renewable energy development policy on the sustainability of electricity market: A stackelberg game analysis,"Optimizing the electricity structure and achieving sustainable development are critical objectives in the current electricity market. To facilitate a low-carbon transition, China is planning to implement renewable energy development policies based on carbon emissions trading (CET), which includes feed-in premiums (FIP), renewable portfolio standards (RPS), and their corresponding green certificate trading mechanisms. However, it remains to be seen how these policies will work together to promote the growth and adoption of renewable energy sources in China. Accordingly, this paper aims to establish a Stackelberg game model of the electricity market under the two types of combination policy scenarios of CET-FIP and CET-RPS and compare the influence of different combination policies on the development of the renewable energy industry. The results show that: (1) Compared with a single renewable energy development policy, CET-RPS and CET-FIP policies can effectively reduce carbon emissions. (2) In the long run, the CET-RPS policy has a stronger ability to reduce emissions, and the CET-FIP policy has stronger economic benefits. (3) In the early stage of renewable energy development, electricity generation, profit of power generation companies, and social welfare are higher under the CET-RPS policy, while in the mature stage of renewable energy development, these important performance indices become better under the CET-FIP policy. (4) Under the CET-RPS policy, an increase in carbon price will result in an increase in on-grid price and a decrease in green certificate price. In contrast, under the CET-FIP policy, an increase in carbon price will lead to an increase in on-grid price and premium subsidy.",Not About Sufficiency
Illustrating the conflicts between energy poverty and decarbonization in the energy transition. A case example in Spain,"The energy transition required to meet decarbonization goals will change dramatically the type of technologies and energy sources used in our economies, as well as the way we consume this energy. This in turn may have a significant impact on typically low-income, vulnerable consumers, which may not be able to carry out the required investments and fuel changes, or may suffer from higher prices. A multi-criteria, multi-stakeholder long-term energy planning model is used in this paper to evaluate how the sometimes conflicting criteria -such as the increase in total system costs and energy poverty after imposing limits on CO2 and pollutant emissions- and stakeholders' preferences interact when trying to achieve 2050 decarbonization objectives for Spain. Our results show a significant degree of conflict between objectives: energy poverty increases when decarbonization advances, and vulnerable households may not be able to achieve a full decarbonization of their demand due to budget constraints. The conflict between atmospheric pollution and the rest of criteria is also highlighted. Finally, the study also shows how the preferences of certain stakeholders groups, i.e., utilities, regulators, environmentalists and academia, may accentuate these conflicts. We conclude that the efforts toward decarbonization must be accompanied by targeted financial support mechanisms, and robust regulatory frameworks to protect vulnerable households. We also emphasize the need to incorporate social equity considerations into energy planning models and the necessity for continuous monitoring and adjustment of energy policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Hydrogen justice,"For a rapid energy transition to renewable energy, green hydrogen is increasingly considered a solution to a myriad of challenges: climate neutrality, clean energy supply, and decoupling of growth and carbon emissions. However, whether the global hydrogen transition will indeed be a just transition is far from certain. This paper introduces the concept of hydrogen justice as an analytical toolkit to help examining justice challenges of the global hydrogen transition. Placing hydrogen justice at the nexus of energy, water and climate justice, and incorporating crucial insights from political ecology and decolonial studies we highlight potential hydrogen injustices and suggest a six-dimensional concept of hydrogen justice: procedural, distributive, restorative, relational, recognitional and epistemological justice. Our research explores socio-ecological, political and economic conditions in hydrogen target countries and examines emerging hydrogen projects and partnerships. Hydrogen injustices may manifest around issues of energy access in countries with high rates of energy poverty, water access in arid regions, as well as forced displacements, impairments of Indigenous livelihoods and the strengthening of authoritarian rule. We conclude that hydrogen injustices result from the interplay of global hydrogen governance and local conditions in producing countries. We illustrate this with examples from transnational hydrogen projects situated in Morocco and Namibia. Finally, we suggest strategies for redressing hydrogen injustices by integrating justice principles at all scales of hydrogen governance.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards a new approach to income distribution and environmental sustainability,"The paper argues that, in contemporary market economies, most production is debt financed. In order to pay off these debts, there is a necessity for economic growth that results in enormous waste of human effort and a misuse of the earth's resources. The Douglas-Orage Social Credit analysis, which attracted world-wide attention during the 1920s and 1930s, concluded that the pressure for economic growth, induced by the role of finance, led inevitably to economic and military rivalry between nations, and to long run environmental degradation, because short run maximization decisions squander non-sustainable resources, whilst ignoring the 'third party' social benefits and costs that arise out of the process of exchanges. The Draft Mining Scheme put forward by Douglas and Orage in 1920 sought to avoid these difficulties by devolving responsibility for finance to industrially based local producers' banks. Such a financial system could create a framework under which ecological sustainability becomes economically viable. Economic developments over the decades since the Douglas-Orage texts were published have emphasized the need to remove the dominant role of finance in determining economic and industrial policy.",Not About Sufficiency

"Investigating the physical activity, health, wellbeing, social and environmental effects of a new urban greenway: a natural experiment (the PARC study)","Background Evidence for the health benefits of urban green space tends to stem from small, short-term quasi-experimental or cross-sectional observational research, whilst evidence from intervention studies is sparse. The development of an urban greenway (9 km running along 3 rivers) in Northern Ireland provided the opportunity to conduct a natural experiment. This study investigated the public health impact of the urban greenway on a range of physical activity, health, wellbeing, social, and perceptions of the environment outcomes.Methods A repeated cross-sectional household survey of adult residents (aged ≥16 years) who lived ≤1-mile radius of the greenway (intervention sample) and > 1-mile radius of the greenway (control sample) was conducted pre (2010/2011) and 6-months post implementation (2016/2017). We assessed changes in outcomes pre- and post-intervention follow-up including physical activity behaviour (primary outcome measure: Global Physical Activity Questionnaire), quality of life, mental wellbeing, social capital and perceptions of the built environment. Linear regression was used to calculate the mean difference between post-intervention and baseline measures adjusting for age, season, education, car ownership and deprivation. Multi-level models were fitted using a random intercept at the super output area (smallest geographical unit) to account for clustering within areas. The analyses were stratified by distance from the greenway and deprivation. We assessed change in the social patterning of outcomes over time using an ordered logit to make model-based outcome predictions across strata.Results The mean ages of intervention samples were 50.3 (SD 18.9) years at baseline (n = 1037) and 51.7 (SD 19.1) years at follow-up (n = 968). Post-intervention, 65% (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.00) of residents who lived closest to the greenway (i.e., ≤400 m) and 60% (adjusted OR, 0.64 95% CI 0.41 to 0.99) who lived furthest from the greenway (i.e.,≥1200 m) met the physical activity guidelines - 68% of the intervention sample met the physical activity guidelines before the intervention. Residents in the most deprived quintiles had a similar reduction in physical activity behaviour as residents in less deprived quintiles. Quality of life at follow-up compared to baseline declined and this decline was significantly less than in the control area (adjusted differences in mean EQ5D: -11.0 (95% CI − 14.5 to − 7.4); − 30.5 (95% CI − 37.9 to − 23.2). Significant change in mental wellbeing was not observed despite improvements in some indicators of social capital. Positive perceptions of the local environment in relation to its attractiveness, traffic and safety increased.Conclusions Our findings illustrate the major challenge of evaluating complex urban interventions and the difficulty of capturing and measuring the network of potential variables that influence or hinder meaningful outcomes. The results indicate at this stage no intervention effect for improvements in population-level physical activity behaviour or mental wellbeing. However, they show some modest improvements for secondary outcomes including positive perceptions of the environment and social capital constructs. The public health impact of urban greenways may take a longer period of time to be realised and there is a need to improve evaluation methodology that captures the complex systems nature of urban regeneration.",Not About Sufficiency
Human well-being versus ecological footprint in MENA countries: A trade-off?,"How to improve environmental quality and achieve human development remains major sustainability issues, particularly in the MENA region (the Middle East and North Africa). Most of the empirical literature fails to consider human well-being and environmental quality together although these concepts are fundamentally similar in their concern for distributive justice. This inquiry uses panel data for 13 MENA countries over the period 1990-2016 to examine the association between human development and ecological footprint and test whether trade-off nexus holds between these two sustainability-based indicators. To increase the policy relevance of this inquiry, the MENA region is divided into two sub-groups of countries: seven oil exporting countries and six non-oil exporting countries. The highlights pointed out the presence of a strong trade-off between the ecological footprint and human well-being captured by human development index for the whole sample and across the two subsamples. The crucial role played by economic institutions may help the MENA countries to mitigate the trade-offs to achieve simultaneously both targets of human well-being and environmental protection.

Human well-being in the Anthropocene: limits to growth,"Non-technical summary Transformation of the world towards sustainability in line with the 2030 Agenda requires progress on multiple dimensions of human well-being. We track development of relevant indicators for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1-7 against gross domestic product (GDP) per person in seven world regions and the world as a whole. Across the regions, we find uniform development patterns where SDGs 1-7 - and therefore main human needs - are achieved at around US$15,000 measured in 2011 US$ purchasing power parity (PPP). Technical summary How does GDP per person relate to the achievement of well-being as targeted by the 2030 Agenda? The 2030 Agenda includes global ambitions to meet human needs and aspirations. However, these need to be met within planetary boundaries. In nascent world-earth modelling, human well-being as well as global environmental impacts are linked through economic production, which is tracked by GDP. We examined historic developments on 5-year intervals, 1980-2015, between average income and the advancement on indicators of SDGs 1-7. This was done for both seven world regions and the world as a whole. We find uniform patterns of saturation for all regions above an income threshold somewhere around US$15,000 measured in 2011 US$ PPP. At this level, main human needs and capabilities are met. The level is also consistent with studies of life satisfaction and the Easterlin paradox. We observe stark differences with respect to scale: the patterns of the world as an aggregated whole develop differently from all its seven regions, with implications for world-earth model construction - and sustainability transformations.

Utilising panel data from 68 countries spanning the years 2006 to 2020, this study explores the effect of RETI on human development index (HDI) and reveals several important findings. First, RETI significantly promotes HDI. Second, RETI indirectly improves HDI through energy structure optimisation, energy efficiency improvement, and energy poverty alleviation. Third, RETI is more effective in improving HDI in countries with high quality of government governance, as well as in international energy agency (IEA) member countries.

Human development at the cost of the environment?-an application of planetary pressures-adjusted human development index in the lens of planetary boundaries,"The human development index (HDI) was an important step toward a more human-oriented assessment of socioeconomic prosperity. Nevertheless, at the onset of the anthropocene, the environmental pillar of sustainable development is indispensable. This work aims to understand this conundrum of human development and its environmental cost or pressure through the use of the planetary pressures-adjusted human development index (PHDI) as well as introduce another modified version, planetary pressures, and inequality-adjusted human development index (PIHDI). PHDI incorporates two biophysical consumption-based indicators (CO2 emissions and material footprint, MF) as a proxy of environmental pressures into traditionally socioeconomic development-focused HDI. This work spans 164 nations and 27 years (1990-2016). Various statistical techniques such as Pearson's correlation, hierarchical clustering (HCA), generalised additive modelling (GAM), data envelopment analysis (DEA), linear regression, and ARIMA forecasting have been used to explore interrelationships, non-linearity, efficiency analysis, and future projections (up to 2030) and delve into two scenarios: high human development and for human development permitted only within the two planetary boundaries (PBs) (viz. climate change and material footprint) and their consequences when exceeded. Though most of the countries with high PHDI and PIHDI scores are from the global north and have a high income, it is also possible to attain human development (i.e. increase PHDI and PIHDI scores) without overexploiting biophysical resources. From 2016, human development scores could increase by 55-63% (climate change) or 30-46% (material consumption) within a safe operating space in 2030. Without the required focus on the environment, aiming for a superior score in PHDI and PIHDI could result in 43-58% (CO2 emissions) or 57-58% (material footprint) of countries that would exceed PB. Based on the outcome of this work, it can be recommended that governments and policymakers that it is well within the limits of feasibility as well as necessary to make human socioeconomic development aspire to sustainability to address the needs of humanity, while respecting the well-being of the surrounding biosphere.",Not About Sufficiency

The unusually high temperatures, humidity, and unpredicted rainfall gave rise to disease like dengue and affecting peoples mental health. However, the government, as well as public and private groups, are undertaking some phenomenal efforts to help reduce environmental degradation and raise the number of green footprints. The objective of this article is to examine the green initiatives, strategies, and policies of Bangladeshi organizations in enhancing green footprints in the socio‐economic spaces, through comprehensive content analysis of various newspapers, journal articles, government reports, and company annual reports. The aim of this article is to trace out the evidences of change in the socio‐economic fabric of the society. The primary focus of the article on the environment friendly business activities, which eventually bring social changes. The article found that green HRM, green business, MFS, green corporate culture is increasingly been seen in the society, which indicate silent changes. Bangladesh has put regulations and programs into place to lessen carbon emissions and safeguard sensitive coastal areas. It is noteworthy for demonstrating a strong dedication to improving sustainable development and environmental preservation. Many organizations in Bangladesh have also received the prestigious Asia's Corporate Excellence and Sustainability Awards for their outstanding zeal to ensure positive environmental changes in the society. Moreover, large proportion of Bangladesh's energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, leading to the installed renewable energy capacity of 579 MW. Additionally, the government has announced plans on replacing traditional transport methods with electric or hybrid vehicles. Bangladesh has further solidified its position as the global leader in green garments factories, as the country has 176 such facilities that have received the USGBC's LEED accreditation.

Increasing social resilience against climate change risks: a case of extreme climate affected countries,"PurposeSocial development is the ultimate goal of every nation, and climate change is a major stumbling block. Climate Risk Index has documented several climate change events with their devastations in terms of lives lost and economic cost. This study aims to link the climate change and renewable energy with the social progress of extreme climate affected countries.Design/methodology/approachThis research used the top 50 most climate-affected countries of the decade and estimated the impact of climate risk on social progress with moderation effects of renewable energy and technology. Several competing panel data models such as quantile regression, bootstrap quantile regression and feasible generalized least square are used to generate robust estimates.FindingsThe results confirm that climate hazards obstruct socioeconomic progress, but renewable energy and technology can help to mitigate the repercussion. Moreover, improved institutions enhance the social progress of nations.Research limitations/implicationsGovernment should improve the institutional quality that enhances their performance in terms of Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law and Control of Corruption to increase social progress. In addition, society should use renewable energy instead of fossil fuels to avoid environmental degradation and health hazards. Innovation and technology also play an important role in social progress and living standards, so there should be free hand to private business research and development, encouraging research institutes and universities to come forward for innovation and research.Practical implicationsThe ultimate goal of all human struggle is to have progress that facilitates human beings to uplift their living standard. One of the best measures that can tell us about a nation’s progress is Social Progress Index (SPI), and one of many factors that can abruptly change it is the climate; so this study is an attempt to link the relationship among these variables and also discuss the situation where the impact of climate can be reduced.Social implicationsAlthough social progress is an important concept of today’s economics discussion, relatively few studies are using the SPI to measure social well-being. Similarly, there is consensus about the impact of climate on people, government and crops but relatively less study about its overall impact on social progress, so this study attempts to fill the gap about the relationship between social progress and climate change.Originality/valueThe main contribution of this study is the solution for the impact of climate risk. Climate risk is not in human control, and we cannot eliminate it, but we can reduce the negative impacts of climate change. Moderator impact of renewable energy decreases the negative impact of climate change, so there is a need to use more renewable energy to mitigate the bad consequences of climate on social progress. Another moderator is technology; using technology will also mitigate the negative consequences of the climate, so there is a need to facilitate technological advancement.",Not About Sufficiency

How is energy transition shaping a path to common prosperity and sustainable economic growth?,"This study assesses the impact of the transition to renewable energy and improved societal well-being on environmentally sustainable economies, concentrating on 20 major CO2-emitting countries from 2000 to 2020. Employing the pooled mean group (PMG) method, the findings indicate that a 1% increase in fossil fuel consumption results in a significant short-term decline of approximately 0.22% and a more substantial long-term decrease of 0.43% in green growth. This decline is attributed to the exacerbation of environmental degradation through notable carbon emissions. Interestingly, a 1% increase in the Human Development Index (HDI) is associated with heightened green growth, indicating an increased awareness of environmental issues. Conversely, a 1% reduction in population has a negative impact on green growth, underscoring the importance of balancing population dynamics with sustainable development. Furthermore, diminished internet penetration, rural electrification, and poverty exert adverse effects on the green growth index. The implementation of practical policies for major CO2 emitters is crucial, encompassing initiatives such as digitalizing the green finance market, promoting ICT diffusion, advancing regional green power generation, adopting eco-friendly practices in petroleum industries, and liberalizing green utilities trade.

"How 'green energy' is threatening biodiversity, human health, and environmental justice: An example from the Mojave Desert, California","In recent years, the Mojave Desert, which is known for its unique and endemic plant and animal diversity, has become a preferred area for renewable energy developments. However, an environmental impact that is not calculated into the production of green energy has emerged that not only puts an additional burden on already endangered species but also affects the quality of life for residents living in disadvantaged and underserved communities. Using the example of just another solar farm to be built on 2,300 acres of pristine desert land, we point out the negative impacts of unsustainable land development on community health and environmental justice, driven by the administration of Kern County, which promotes and prioritizes economic growth over residents' concerns.

HOW DOES SOCIAL INNOVATION CONTRIBUTE TO THE ENERGY TRANSITION? A SWOT ANALYSIS,"Social innovation promotes civic engagement in the energy transition. The objective of this paper is to identify the critical factors which foster or hinder the development of social innovation initiatives for the energy transition in Portugal. For this, we identified crucial factors by reviewing relevant literature and working documents related to social innovation and the energy sector in Portugal, and we applied a SWOT analysis. The findings demonstrate that governmental policies supporting renewable energy implantation and social entrepreneurship, high dependence on imports of fossil fuels, equitable distribution of cost and benefits, and engagement of citizens on energy issues are some of the strengths. However, the lack of planning strategies, difficult access to finance, high initial investment cost, and government bureaucratic processes are some of the weaknesses. Several opportunities favour the social innovation initiatives in energy transition, and these include the high price of fuels, increasing importance of societal challenges, and promoting the circular economy. Some threats hindering the contribution of social innovation to the energy transition include land ownership, fossil fuel dominance, development of the other types of innovation, environmental impacts and food security.

How does carbon tax affect social welfare and emission reduction in Finland?,"Environmental concerns related to fossil fuels utilization has developed different energy/environmental policy tools that Carbon tax is one of the important ones. There are huge debates among different political parties related to the positive and negative effects of the carbon tax on the energy and environmental policies of the countries. However, carbon tax not only can have effects on the utilization and consumption of energy sources portfolios, but it may also have negative or positive effects on the economy, industry, and social welfare of the countries that should be identified and analyzed, in particular for countries with high energy-intensive industries such as Finland. The purpose of this research is to answer the question: ""How does Carbon Tax affect social welfare and emission reduction in Finland?'' We use the computable general equilibrium model to analyze the impact of the carbon tax on social welfare and the rate of emission reduction. Considering the fact that Finland has several years of carbon tax policy application background, evaluation of the impact of this policy on Finland's social-environmental structure is very valuable for other countries, especially newcomers. Our results show that despite carbon tax policy in Finland has been successful in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, however, it has negative effects on the social welfare of Finns.

This study aims to explore the impact of carbon emission reduction on urban resilience and its spatial -temporal characteristics with a sample of 267 prefectural-level cities from 2006 to 2019 in China. Firstly, this research conceptualizes urban resilience as economic prosperity, social wellbeing, cleaner environment and analyzes the impact mechanism of carbon emission reduction on these three dimensions. Then in the empirical analysis, the urban resilience assessment index is built to quantitatively evaluate urban resilience in Chinese cities and its spatial-temporal characteristics. Subsequently, the impact of carbon emission on urban resilience is investigated through geostatistical analysis. The results show that the urban resilience level in China shows significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. High resilience cities are clustered in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta region and Pearl River Delta region, while lower resilience cities are in the northeast, northwest and southwest regions. Moreover, urban resilience in Chinese cities is mainly contributed by the economic subsystem. Over the study period, carbon emission reduction is positively related to urban resilience with high resilience and high carbon emission reduction agglomerated over space. Furthermore, the agglom-eration effect increased from 2006 to 2019. These indicate that in the past fifteen years, urban resilience in Chinese cities is highly dependent on regional economic development which is still reliant on emission-intensive industries. The research provides important references for China's carbon emission reduction and resilience -building policies. Spatial heterogeneities need to be acknowledged to focus on key areas of emission reduction and resilience improvement in policymaking and implementation.",Not About Sufficiency
Hotspots of land-use change in global biodiversity hotspots,"Land-use conversion from natural areas to agriculture and human settlements is causing global biodiversity loss. We proposed a human land-use disturbance index (LDI) to assess habitat loss and fragmentation in global biodiversity hotspots from 1992 to 2015. Negative (LDI > 1) and positive (LDI < 1) impacts on habitat were observed in 30 and 6 biodiversity hotspots, respectively. The hotspots with a relatively small proportional area of nature-dominated land were more likely to face habitat loss. The area of nature-dominated land in the global biodiversity hotspots decreased by 287.37 x 10(3) km(2), which was 1.56% of the level in 1992. Agricultural land occupation and urban encroachment contributed to approximately 90% and 10% of the habitat loss in global biodiversity hotspots, respectively. Habitat loss caused by agricultural land occupation was notable in the hotspots (Sundaland, Indo-Burma and Cerrado) within the developing nations, whereas urban expansion threats to biodiversity were more evident in the hotspots (North American Coastal Plain and Forests of East Australia) within the developed nations. Together with the human development index (HDI) results, we found that low land-use disturbance did not occur as expected in developed areas. The 6 biodiversity hotspots with positive effects were all located in the developing nations. The results indicated that human development did not necessarily result in negative effects on habitats; however, human development goals oriented by the HDI without environmental and ecological dimensions would not be beneficial to biodiversity conservation. These findings shed new light on the impacts of land-use change on global biodiversity hotspots and provide valuable information for global land-use monitoring and biodiversity risk assessments.",Not About Sufficiency
Analyzing the Progress of China and the World in Achieving Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13,"AbstractAchieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) and SDG 13 together requires a holistic and integrated approach to simultaneously address the challenges of clean energy and climate action. In order to find integrated policy strategies, this study offers a comparative analysis using the case of China and the world regarding energy access, energy intensity, clean cooking, renewable energy, global warming gases, and investment in energy by the private sector to advance SDGs 7 and 13, applying a principal component regression (PCR) and forecasting models for the period 1990 to 2021. Overall, these findings indicate that China is making significant progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. This progress is evident in the notable variations observed in key variables such as access to clean cooking solutions, private sector investments in energy, renewable energy generation, and enhanced energy efficiency. In contrast, the global landscape exhibits only minimal fluctuations in these aspects within its framework. The PCR proves that all the components are significant regarding China, whereas, for the world, seven components are significant out of eight. Furthermore, the global temperature projection indicates that the world is nearing the 1-degree Celsius threshold, with the current temperature standing at 0.558 degrees Celsius. This suggests that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030 remains attainable. Notably, China’s projected average temperature for 2030 is 7.2 degrees Celsius, marking a 12% decrease from the 2021 temperature level. This trajectory aligns with China’s commitment to achieving the 1.5-degree Celsius target by 2030. This study makes a valuable contribution to the field of energy transition, offering insights into the path to maintaining global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius as stipulated by the Paris Agreement by 2030.",Not About Sufficiency

A Global Assessment: Can Renewable Energy Replace Fossil Fuels by 2050?,"Our study evaluated the effectiveness of using eight pathways in combination for a complete to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy by 2050. These pathways included renewable energy development; improving energy efficiency; increasing energy conservation; carbon taxes; more equitable balancing of human wellbeing and per capita energy use; cap and trade systems; carbon capture, utilization, and storage; and nuclear power development. We used the annual ‘British Petroleum statistical review of world energy 2021’ report as our primary database. Globally, fossil fuels, renewable (primarily hydro, wind and solar), nuclear energy accounted for 83%, 12.6%, and 6.3% of the total energy consumption in 2020. To achieve zero fossil fuel use by 2050, we found that renewable energy production will need to be increased by up to 6-fold or 8-fold if energy demand is held constant at, or increased 50% from, the 2020 energy demand level. Constraining 2050 world energy demand to a 25% increase over the 2020 level, improves the probability of achieving independence from fossil fuels. Improvements in energy efficiency need to accelerate beyond the current rate of ~1.5% per year. Aggressive application of energy conservation policies involving land use and taxation could potentially reduce world energy use by 10% or more by 2050. Our meta-analysis shows that the minimum level of per capita energy consumption that would allow 8 billion people to have a ‘Decent Living Standard’ is on average ~70 GJ per capita per year, which is 93% of the 2020 global average. Developed countries in temperate climates with high vehicle-dependency needed ~120 GJ per capita year−1, whereas equatorial countries with low vehicle-dependency needed 30 GJ per capita year−1. Our meta-analyses indicated replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy by 2050 may be possible but will require aggressive application of all eight pathways, major lifestyle changes in developed countries, and close cooperation among all countries.",Not About Sufficiency
Historical evolution of global inequality in carbon emissions and footprints versus redistributive scenarios,"Ambitious scenarios of carbon emission redistribution for mitigating climate change in line with the Paris Agreement and reaching the sustainable development goal of eradicating poverty have been proposed recently. They imply a strong reduction in carbon footprint inequality by 2030 that effectively halves the Gini coefficient to about 0.25. This paper examines feasibility of these scenarios by analyzing the historical evolution of both weighted international inequality in CO2 emissions attributed territorially and global inequality in carbon footprints attributed to end consumers. For the latter, a new dataset is constructed that is more comprehensive than existing ones, and footprints are found to be more unequal than territorial emissions. In both cases, we find a decreasing trend in global inequality, partially attributed to the move of China from the lower to the middle part of the distributio. Still, realization of the redistributive scenarios would require an unprecedented reduction in global inequality far below historical levels. Moreover, the territorial emissions data, available for more recent years up to 2017, show a saturation of the decreasing Gini coefficient at a level of 0.5. This observation confirms an earlier prediction based on maximal entropy reasoning that the Lorenz curve converges to the exponential distribution. This saturation further undermines feasibility of the redistributive scenarios, which are also hindered by structural tendencies that reinforce carbon footprint inequality under global capitalism. One way out of this conundrum is a fast decarbonization of the global energy supply in order to decrease global carbon emissions without relying crucially on carbon inequality reduction.

"Himalayan fruit and circular economy: nutraceutical potential, traditional uses, challenges and opportunities","The Himalayas, globally acknowledged as one of the four biodiversity hotspots, underscore their ecological significance, boasting abundant flora and fauna. Among these, a diverse array of wild fruits such as Aegle marmelos, Artocarpus lakoocha, Baccaurea spp., Carissa spp., and others provide essential nutrition for local populations. These fruits, rich in bioactive compounds, offer nutraceutical potential, contributing to health aspects like antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. The integration of Himalayan wild fruits into circular practices supports sustainable livelihoods. The responsible harvesting, efficient processing, and value addition of these fruits align with circular principles, striking a balance between conservation and progress. Technologies such as anaerobic digestion, waste-to-energy conversion, and composting can harness waste generated during cultivation and processing, contributing to a circular economy and rural Himalayan community development. Preserving, accessing, and commercializing underutilized fruits can significantly enhance economic prosperity and the quality of life for inhabitants. However, integrating these fruits into agriculture faces multifaceted challenges, spanning social, economic, environmental, agronomic, and political dimensions. Addressing these challenges is crucial for sustainable development, aiming to eradicate poverty, malnutrition, and hidden hunger. Moreover, addressing these challenges is not only vital for sustainable development in the Himalayan region but also for mitigating carbon footprints and tackling issues like poverty, malnutrition, hidden hunger, and climate change. The exploration of these concepts within the Himalayan context holds immense promise for sustainable development and ecological conservation.",Not About Sufficiency

Heavy metals/-metalloids (As) phytoremediation with Landoltia punctata and Lemna sp. (duckweeds): coupling with biorefinery prospects for sustainable phytotechnologies,"Heavy metals/-metalloids can result in serious human health hazards. Phytoremediation is green bioresource technology for the remediation of heavy metals and arsenic (As). However, there exists a knowledge gap and systematic information on duckweed-based metal phytoremediation in an eco-sustainable way. Therefore, the present review offers a critical discussion on the effective use of duckweeds (genera Landoltia and Lemna)-based phytoremediation to decontaminate metallic contaminants from wastewater. Phytoextraction and rhizofiltration were the major mechanism in 'duckweed bioreactors' that can be dependent on physico-chemical factors and plant-microbe interactions. The biotechnological advances such as gene manipulations can accelerate the duckweed-based phytoremediation process. High starch and protein contents of the metal-loaded duckweed biomass facilitate their use as feedstock in biorefinery. Biorefinery prospects such as bioenergy production, value-added products, and biofertilizers can augment the circular economy approach. Coupling duckweed-based phytoremediation with biorefinery can help achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and human well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
Health and the green economy: challenges for sustainable development and the eradication of poverty,"In a scenario where ecosystemic services are being eroded and there is high social inequity, a new model of development is necessary, namely one capable of promoting social development with a reduction of its ecological footprint.

This paper seeks to analyze the environmental, social and individual impacts on human health in the context of a 'brown economy', and discusses the contributions of a green economy on the promotion of equity and health. The assumption is that economic development and environmental sustainability are not incompatible and both contribute to the eradication of poverty. The transition to a sustainable economy depends on political decisions, and transcends technological developments. Above all, it should instigate new models of production, consumption and social organization, which promote socio-environmental justice, encouraging social participation and democratic forms of governance to define a solid agenda for the implementation of sustainable development and mechanisms to implement them at all levels.",Not About Sufficiency
"Have countries moved towards sustainable development or not? Definition, criteria, indicators and empirical analysis","Have countries moved towards sustainable development (SD) or not ? To answer the question, first, a new SD definition, i.e. ""Achieving higher and more equally distributed well-being levels within ecological limits"", is proposed. Second, based on the definition and from a global perspective, four criteria are established to judge whether countries have moved towards SD, which are: (1) well-being levels have been higher and more equally distributed; (2) levels of ecological consumption have been lower; (3) ecological capacities have strengthened; and (4) the Ultimate Efficiency, which is the efficiency of transforming ecological consumption into human well-being, has improved. Developing countries with ecological consumption below global average do not have to meet the second criterion. Third, the Happy and Equal Human Development Index, the Ecological Footprint and the Biocapacity are selected to measure human well-being, ecological consumption and ecological capacities, respectively and two consistent methods are used to measure the Ultimate Efficiency. The empirical analysis of 102 countries during 2011-2016 demonstrates that 19 countries have met the required four or three criteria and moved towards SD and that 12 countries have met none of the required criteria and moved against SD. The main contribution is to provide a clear SD definition, specific criteria and reliable indicators for measuring national performance and informing decision making on moving towards SD. Therefore, whether countries have moved towards SD or not can be judged and measured continuously and regularly. Future research needs to detailedly explore why countries have met or not met one certain criterion.",Not About Sufficiency

Harnessing place attachment for local climate mitigation? Hypothesising connections between broadening representations of place and readiness for change,"Public engagement in local environmental planning and decision-making is often advocated on various grounds, both instrumental and normative. Yet in developed countries in the context of renewable energy infrastructure deployment, place attachment, place identity and place-protective action continue to be implicated in public objection. We set out an interdisciplinary change readiness hypothesis of specifically how local participatory scenario or visioning processes that include climate mitigation measures may support the mobilisation of place attachment for climate mitigation, including renewable energy deployment. We hypothesise that local visioning may support movement towards change readiness by helping to anchor unfamiliar social representations of low carbon energy infrastructure and new patterns of urban form in existing, more positive representations of localities and associated attachments. To this end, seeking ways to modify threat perceptions relating to climate change and renewable energy infrastructure is advocated as a key direction for study.",Not About Sufficiency
Using the Gini coefficient with BIOLOG substrate utilisation data to provide an alternative quantitative measure for comparing bacterial soil communities,"A measure quantifying unequal use of carbon sources, the Gini coefficient (G), has been developed to allow comparisons of the observed functional diversity of bacterial soil communities. This approach was applied to the analysis of substrate utilisation data obtained from using BIOLOG microtiter plates in a study which compared decomposition processes in two contrasting plant substrates in two different soils. The relevance of applying the Gini coefficient as a measure of observed functional diversity, for soil bacterial communities is evaluated against the Shannon index (H) and average well colour development (AWCD), a measure of the total microbial activity. Correlation analysis and analysis of variance of the experimental data show that the Gini coefficient, the Shannon index and AWCD provided similar information when used in isolation. However, analyses based on the Gini coefficient and the Shannon index, when total activity on the microtiter plates was maintained constant (i.e. AWCD as a covariate), indicate that additional information about the distribution of carbon sources being utilised can be obtained. We demonstrate that the Lorenz curve and its measure of inequality, the Gini coefficient, provides not only comparable information to AWCD and the Shannon index but when used together with AWCD encompasses measures of total microbial activity and absorbance inequality across all the carbon sources. This information is especially relevant for comparing the observed functional diversity of soil microbial communities.",Not About Sufficiency
The illusion of local sustainability and self-sufficiency: famine in a border area of northwestern Zambia,"Sustainability is a complex and sometimes fragile condition, as shown by this case study from Zambia's North-Western Province. The long-term evolution of a cassava-based agricultural system provided enough staple food for a rapidly growing population of immigrants and refugees, but a mealybug invasion in 1985-1989 destroyed much of the cassava and triggered a famine for many people. The famine, caused by the interaction of ecological, political, and economic factors, demonstrated that locally self-sufficient sustainability was an illusion. This case demonstrates that: resourceful villages are an essential dynamic element in evolving food-production systems and in coping with famine; localities are ecologically, politically, and economically incorporated and vulnerable, rather than being isolated and self-sufficient; and biodiversity is essential in a world of not-yet-recognized pests (and diseases). -Author",Not About Sufficiency

Promoting sustainable waste management for regional economic development in European Mediterranean countries,"The aims of this study were to (i) provide a critique of waste hierarchy (WH), (ii) provide a policy review of the circular economy (CE), and (iii) recommend best management practices (BMPs) in the Mediterranean under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12. European Mediterranean countries (i.e. Spain, France, Italy, Malta, Slovenia, Croatia, Greece, and Cyprus) were evaluated via the measurement of the total factor productivity (TFP) and its components (i.e. efficiency change and technological change). Productivity performance was measured via the Malmquist (MPI) and the Malmquist—Luenberger (MLPI) productivity indices. The incorporation of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation as an undesirable output can provide specific information linked with productivity performance and economic development. Greece (1.9%) and Cyprus (1.6%) were found to have the greatest TFPs based on the MPI, while Malta (2.2%) and Greece (1.9%) had the highest scores in terms of the MLPI (i.e. upon incorporating waste generation into the model). In essence, the incorporation of municipal waste generation reduced productivity performance in the studied countries.

Toward Low-Carbon European Union Society: Young Poles’ Perception of Climate Neutrality,"(1) Introduction: The European Union is a global leader in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The community’s population has already reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 22%, while the gross domestic product (GDP) in its member states increased by 58% between 1990 and 2017. The Union has shown that economic growth is possible in the link between politics, nature, and the citizens’ eco-empathy. It has implications for both the European and global economy, infrastructure, food production, public health, and biodiversity, the formula for political stability. The hallmark of the European Union is the blending of politics, culture, and nature in its quest for climate neutrality. The community’s horizon is a zero-emission economy by 2050. (2) Theoretical framework: The cognitive assumptions of the article are the following theses: 1. The Union strives to accelerate the transition process to a regenerative growth model using technologies for obtaining and distributing energy for individual and collective needs; 2. The Union and the European citizens want to hand over more to planet Earth than they take away from it, thus making progress toward keeping resource consumption within planetary limits. 3. The Union aims to reduce its consumption footprint and double the rate of applying closed-loop materials in the next decade. Finally, it fits in with the organization’s policy projections. (3) Methodology and research results: Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in the research process. The literature has been analyzed on the subject and the applicable legal acts, making it possible to classify, generalize, describe, and systematize the facts collected during the research. A survey was conducted on 1106 students, and in-depth interviews were conducted with three energy experts: Krzysztof Tomaszewski (the University of Warsaw, researcher and lecturer on energy security issues), Dariusz Pachniewski (inventor in energy sector, businessman in hydrogen energy sector), and Tomoho Umeda (President of Polish Chamber of Commerce). The research aimed to identify the environmental and energy awareness, knowledge of renewable energy sources, and opinions of young Poles on their use in two areas: home and work. (4) Discussion: The reinforced narrative of creating a low-carbon society, a green economy, was adapted and evaluated for innovative individual and collective approaches in the research conducted in this paper. In the quantitative and qualitative samples, the assumptions made were double-checked. The former verified the students’ views, while the latter, the experts’ views. The procedure established the directions of knowledge evolution and approach to technologies and innovations among students of technical faculties related to the energy sector. There were existing individual and collective mental constructs on energy transition and climate neutrality identified. (5) Conclusions: The surveys conducted among university students of energy-related majors and specialties and experts revealed important information. First, it concerned the way knowledge is communicated and how it is interpreted; second, informing and implementing the European Union’s climate policy; third, the creation of a low-carbon society; fourth, the perception of climate neutrality among young Poles, and finally, preferences in energy generation and use in homes and businesses.",Not About Sufficiency
DEVELOPING WASTE MANAGEMENT SKILLS FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF FOOD SECTOR,"Economic growth in Europe is causing environmental problems thus highlighting the need to minimize waste.

Bridging the gap between defossilization and decarbonization to achieve net-zero industry,"This paper examines the compatibility of broad decarbonization efforts, as embodied in the circular carbon economy (CCE) framework, with a narrower concept of defossilization in achieving net-zero industry. Through case studies of the United States, Norway, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), we analyze national industrial decarbonization strategies and present findings from extensive fieldwork, including 139 expert interviews and 124 site visits supplemented with document analysis. Our results reveal that CCE and defossilization, which is defined as decarbonization through the elimination of fossil fuel extraction and use, are potentially compatible concepts in the long-term pursuit of net-zero industry. The CCE approach, which incorporates energy efficiency, renewable energy, electrification, low-carbon fuels, and carbon capture, utilization and storage, particularly offers a practical pathway for oil and gas (O&G) producing countries to transition towards net-zero industrial emissions. CCE allows these and similar countries to balance environmental goals with technical, economic, social and political challenges associated with defossilization. The case studies demonstrate that all three countries are adopting CCE strategies tailored to their unique contexts. The US emphasizes a portfolio approach integrating multiple technologies, the UAE focuses on leveraging existing fossil fuel infrastructure for CCE efforts, and Norway capitalizes on its abundant renewable resources while investing in carbon capture and storage and hydrogen projects utilizing its extensive O&G sector expertise and resources. Key policy recommendations include technology and policy leadership from countries pursuing a CCE framework, encouragement of public–private partnerships in the deployment of CCE technologies and ensuring social equity as net-zero industry is pursued in the near and long term. We also summarize existing approaches, pathways, and frameworks for industrial decarbonization, as well as barriers and challenges. We lastly call for further research on integration of CCE and defossilization visions, strategies and roadmaps and a strong focus on international cooperation in achieving net-zero industry.",Not About Sufficiency
How health systems contribute to societal goals,"Traditionally, health system performance assessments have focused on evaluating the health system itself, with less concern about the broader impacts of improved population health beyond the sector. However, in today's interconnected world, health is intricately linked with the environment, sociocultural dynamics, geopolitics and the economy, among others. These interconnections highlight the need for health system performance assessments to recognize that achieving health goals can also contribute to broader societal objectives, including population well-being, economic development, environmental sustainability and social cohesion.Recent health policy discussions have explored, for example, the environmental footprint of health systems, the effects of social factors such as loneliness on well-being, the breakdown of trust in politicians during events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the economic implications of mental health on employment and poverty status. These discussions underline that health systems are responsible for providing health services and have a pivotal role in the improvement of people's health, promotion of overall well-being, happiness and productivity.To better understand the contribution of health systems to broader societal well-being, such goals need to be adequately conceptualized and measured. Well-being is not captured by standard economic measures such as gross domestic product (GDP), which primarily focus on economic growth and fail to reflect income distribution, sustainability practices, non-market transactions and health and education outcomes, many of which contribute to societal well-being. Newer, more holistic measurement approaches to well-being, for example the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) well-being framework,1 attempt to quantify well being through various factors such as health, education, employment, housing, security, gender equality and social connections.In this article, we conceptualize societal well-being from the perspective of the health system's contribution to it. We break down well-being into three societal goals – social cohesion, environmental sustainability and economic development (Fig. 1). The health system contributes to these objectives through actions that primarily serve to achieve its own goals such as improving population health, equity, people-centredness or resilience. Therefore, achieving health system goals leads to consider able contributions to societal goals.",Not About Sufficiency

"Global Social Sustainability and Inclusion: The ""Voice"" of Social and Environmental Imbalances","Background: Global environmental and social research strengthens the protection of people and the environment, develops national capacity for social and environmental management and enables significant progress in terms of transparency, accountability, nondiscrimination and public participation. The support of the general public plays a key role, as it contributes to making public institutions more transparent, accountable and efficient and promotes ground-breaking solutions to complex development challenges. Citizen engagement seems particularly vital throughout the crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as the efficiency of response efforts may frequently depend upon micro-level behavioral changes. The objective of this paper is to provide a complex evaluation and rating of countries based on the social component of the global inclusive circular economy, taking into account the shocks and reverberations experienced by the economy as a whole caused by the COVID-19 and war in Ukraine. The results are presented as a global ranking of countries based on the social component of the global inclusive circular economy. They confirm the high value of this component in the integrated indicator, which validates the hypothesis that inclusiveness is a necessary aspect of the global circular economy. The research results identify the countries capable of offering the best management solutions to social disbalances and other weaknesses, as well as the countries in need of model examples to tackle these issues.",Not About Sufficiency
Global review of human waste-picking and its contribution to poverty alleviation and a circular economy,"Across the globe, the livelihood of millions of people relies on the recovery and sale of valuable materials previously discarded as waste. In developed countries, this is mainly incorporated into the official recycling and resources recovery sector, while in developing countries the informal waste picking activities often make a major contribution. Waste picking provides important opportunities to people who have few or no marketable skills and education and no alternative sources of income to survive. However, waste pickers' living conditions remain deplorable, and their working conditions continue to be dangerous due to hazardous waste. Given the social, economic, and environmental benefits waste pickers bring, and particularly their contribution to circular economy goals in developing nations, the role of waste pickers has mostly been undervalued on the development agenda. This paper examines the literature on waste pickers around the world, their working and living conditions, and explores the issue of formalisation. A total of 45 papers published from 1994 to 2022 were reviewed, covering case studies on waste pickers from 27 different countries. We analyse the content of these papers based on a list of key themes: poverty, health, stigma, environmental factors, informality, and formalisation. We find that the informal status of waste pickers, and the question of them being formalised into a Municipal Solid Waste Management sector is discussed extensively in the literature, and we delve deeper into this theme. Formalisation can potentially bring considerable improvement to the lives of waste pickers, including legal recognition, safe working conditions and fair bargaining mechanisms. In practice however, we find that formalisation policies take significantly different forms from one country to another and often fail to provide these benefits.",Not About Sufficiency
Global forest restoration and the importance of prioritizing local communities,"An analysis of the overlap between tropical forest restoration, human populations, development and national policies for community forest ownership shows that 294.5 million people live within forest restoration opportunity land in the Global South. Forest restoration occupies centre stage in global conversations about carbon removal and biodiversity conservation, but recent research rarely acknowledges social dimensions or environmental justice implications related to its implementation. We find that 294.5 million people live on tropical forest restoration opportunity land in the Global South, including 12% of the total population in low-income countries. Forest landscape restoration that prioritizes local communities by affording them rights to manage and restore forests provides a promising option to align global agendas for climate mitigation, conservation, environmental justice and sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Global change synergies and trade-offs between renewable energy and biodiversity,"Reliance on fossil fuels is causing unprecedented climate change and is accelerating environmental degradation and global biodiversity loss. Together, climate change and biodiversity loss, if not averted urgently, may inflict severe damage on ecosystem processes, functions and services that support the welfare of modern societies. Increasing renewable energy deployment and expanding the current protected area network represent key solutions to these challenges, but conflicts may arise over the use of limited land for energy production as opposed to biodiversity conservation. Here, we compare recently identified core areas for the expansion of the global protected area network with the renewable energy potential available from land-based solar photovoltaic, wind energy and bioenergy (in the form of Miscanthusxgiganteus). We show that these energy sources have very different biodiversity impacts and net energy contributions. The extent of risks and opportunities deriving from renewable energy development is highly dependent on the type of renewable source harvested, the restrictions imposed on energy harvest and the region considered, with Central America appearing at particularly high potential risk from renewable energy expansion. Without restrictions on power generation due to factors such as production and transport costs, we show that bioenergy production is a major potential threat to biodiversity, while the potential impact of wind and solar appears smaller than that of bioenergy. However, these differences become reduced when energy potential is restricted by external factors including local energy demand. Overall, we found that areas of opportunity for developing solar and wind energy with little harm to biodiversity could exist in several regions of the world, with the magnitude of potential impact being particularly dependent on restrictions imposed by local energy demand. The evidence provided here helps guide sustainable development of renewable energy and contributes to the targeting of global efforts in climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation.",Not About Sufficiency
Socio-economic impacts: The poor relations in british environmental impact statements,"This paper examines the need to consider the coverage of socio-economic impacts within the environmental impact assessment process. It goes on to present the results of a review of British environmental impact statements which highlights the failure Of environmental impact statements to address these issues. Fewer than half of those reviewed address any social or economic impacts, and of those that claim to address the issues, the focus is more on economic than social and the quality was found to be poor. A case study is undertaken of power stations.

Energy cost and cardiorespiratory response to wheelchair ambulation and walking,"Aerobic metabolism and cardiorespiratory responses were compared for wheelchair ambulation and walking. Nine able bodied male subjects (av age=24 yr, av wt=86.5 kg) participated in both wheelchair and walking exercise at speeds of 3.2, 4.2 and 5.0 km/hr. Exercise at each speed was 5 min in duration followed by 15 min recovery periods. During the final 2 min of the exercise periods, and during the 5th, 10th and 15th min of the recovery periods oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide output (VCO2), respiratory exchange ratio (R) and minute ventilation (VE) were determined by open circuit spirometry. Heart rate (HR) was measured by a cardiotachometer. It was found that VO2 for wheelchair and walking activity were not significantly different averaging 0.842, 0.999 and 1.260 l/min STPD for 3.2, 4.2 and 5.0 km/hr, respectively. VCO2, R, VE and HR were, however, significantly higher during wheelchair activity at all speeds. Recovery rates for wheelchair activity were generally longer. These data indicate that, at the same speed, acute exposure to operating a wheelchair manually and walking require a similar energy expenditure, but wheelchair activity elicits greater cardiorespiratory stress than does walking. This suggests that wheelchair activity may be hazardous to patients with cardiorespiratory insufficiencies.",Not About Sufficiency
Getting closer to SDG12: incorporating industrial ecology principles into project EIA,"In gearing up environmental impact assessment (EIA) as a tool for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 - ensuring sustainable consumption and production - the concept of industrial ecology (IE) can offer valuable innovations. IE urges the derivation of sustainable and innovative designs from nature. This contribution sought to explore how to operationalize IE within EIA, and to anticipate some foreseeable challenges. A narrative literature review was employed to synthesize prior research. The study suggests that the proposed approach may improve EIA' potential to steer decisions toward SDG12 by strengthening the process's theoretical, analytical, and participatory components. IE's implications for EIA practice are discussed against five key challenges; human resource deficits, informational gaps, institutional barriers, financial resources gaps, and EIA systems' malfunctions. The paper is expected to raise awareness, urge governments to mobilize their EIA systems to meet SDG targets and stimulate further research on the subject.",Not About Sufficiency
"Geothermal energy prospect for decarbonization, EWF nexus and energy poverty mitigation in East Africa; the role of hydrogen production","The affordability and availability of water and energy have a huge impact on food production. Research has shown that there exists a direct and indirect link between power production and clean water generation. Hence the inclusion/importance given to the energy-water-food (EWF) nexus in the United Nations' sustainable development goals. Acknowledging the importance of decarbonization to the global future, there exists a gap in literature on the development of models that can enhance the EWF nexus, reduce energy poverty, and achieve 100% renewable energy in the electricity sector. Therefore, the technical and economic prospect of geothermal energy for bridging the aforementioned gaps in existing works of literature is presented in this study. The energy poverty/wealthy status of a country has been confirmed to have a significant impact on economic development, as economic development is largely reflected in the food-water availability. Ditto, this study is focused on the interconnectivity of the EWF nexus while incorporating global decarbonization targets. Geothermal energy is of the utmost significance in East Africa due to its abundant potential and distinctive geological features. Located in the Great Rift Valley, the region has an abundance of geothermal reservoirs, making it an ideal location for geothermal power generation. This study is novel as a comprehensive assessment framework for energy poverty is developed and innovative models utilizing primarily the geothermal resource in the East African region to mitigate this problem are proposed and analyzed. The role of hydrogen generation from critical excess electricity production is also analyzed. The East Africa region is considered the case study for implementing the models developed. A central renewable energy grid is proposed/modelled to meet the energy demand for seven East African countries namely; Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Djibouti, Comoros, Eritrea, and Rwanda. This study considers 2030, 2040, and 2050 as the timestamp for the implementation of the proposed models. The hybrid mix of the biomass power plant, solar photovoltaic (PV), pumped hydro storage system and onshore wind power is considered to furthermore show the potency of renewable energy resources in this region. Results showed that the use of geothermal energy to meet energy demands in the case study will mitigate energy poverty and enhance the region's EWF.",Not About Sufficiency
Time series land use/land cover mapping and change detection to support policies on sustainable environmental and economic management,"The upper Tekeze River Basin is facing challenges of widespread deforestation and natural vegetation cover degradation that could exacerbate the water scarcity, food insecurity and extreme poverty in the region. Using remote sensing and GIS, this study quantified the land use land cover change trend in the last three decades and analyzed the current land use / cover statues in the basin. A hybrid classification technique is applied to obtain better classification accuracy. Moreover, for automated cloud and cloud shadow detection the newly developed Mountainous Fmask is used. Using post classification change detection technique, seven major land use/cover classes were identified. These classes remained the dominant classes during the study period, showing marked changes in the area coverage within them. Based on the error matrix statistical indices, the classification accuracies of each class are found to be strong. The overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient for the 2021 map are 91% and 89%, respectively. The techniques used have contributed to improving the accuracy of the classification process and helped the classified images to practically match the ground truths. The analysis revealed settlement expansion by 570.31% in parallel with the expansion of farmland by 52.32% during the period 1991–2021. In contrast, the forestland decreased significantly, by 75.55%. The environmental degradation and unplanned use of land resources could have contributed to why the upper Tekeze basin is experiencing worsening poverty, water scarcity and food insecurity. Thus, land use/cover time series modeling is essential for various purposes, including land use planning and, managing natural resources. In this regards this study provides basic information for implementing sustainable environmental conservation strategies in the area.

Fuzzy Cognitive Map-Based Sustainable Socio-Economic Development Planning for Rural Communities,"Every development and production process needs to operate within a circular economy to keep the human being within a safe limit of the planetary boundary. Policymakers are in the quest of a powerful and easy-to-use tool for representing the perceived causal structure of a complex system that could help them choose and develop the right strategies. In this context, fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) can serve as a soft computing method for modelling human knowledge and developing quantitative dynamic models. FCM-based modelling includes the aggregation of knowledge from a variety of sources involving multiple stakeholders, thus offering a more reliable final model. The average aggregation method for weighted interconnections among concepts is widely used in FCM modelling. In this research, we applied the OWA (ordered weighted averaging) learning operators in aggregating FCM weights, assigned by various participants/ stakeholders. Our case study involves a complex phenomenon of poverty eradication and socio-economic development strategies in rural areas under the DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission) in India. Various scenarios examining the economic sustainability and livelihood diversification of poor women in rural areas were performed using the FCM-based simulation process implemented by the ""FCMWizard"" tool. The objective of this study was three-fold: (i) to perform a brief comparative analysis between the proposed aggregation method called ""OWA learning aggregation"" and the conventional average aggregation method, (ii) to identify the significant concepts and their impact on the examined FCM model regarding poverty alleviation, and (iii) to advance the knowledge of circular economy in the context of poverty alleviation. Overall, the proposed method can support policymakers in eliciting accurate outcomes of proposed policies that deal with social resilience and sustainable socio-economic development strategies.",Not About Sufficiency
Future-Proofing Capitalism: The Paradox of the Circular Economy for Plastics,"The marine plastics crisis sparked a wave of corporate interest in the circular economy, a sustainable business model that aims to eliminate waste in industrial systems through recycling, reduction, reuse, and recovery. Drawing on debates about the role of corporations in global environmental governance, this article examines the rise of the circular economy as a dominant corporate sustainability concept, focusing on the flagship example of the circular economy for plastics. It argues that corporations across the plastics value chain have coordinated their efforts to contain the circular economy policy agenda, while extending their markets through developing risky circular economy technologies. These corporate strategies of containment and proliferation represent attempts to ""future-proof"" capitalism against existential threats to public legitimacy, masking the implications for environmental justice. The paradox of the circular economy is that it seems to offer radical challenges to linear ""take-make-waste"" models of industrial capitalism, backed by international legislation, but it does not actually give up on unsustainable growth. We need to tackle the plastics crisis at its root, dramatically reducing the global production of toxic and wasteful plastics.",Not About Sufficiency
Future land-use change and its impact on terrestrial ecosystem carbon pool evolution along the Silk Road under SDG scenarios,"Sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the United Nations 2030 Agenda call for action by all nations to promote economic prosperity while protecting the planet. Projection of future land-use change under SDG scenarios is a new attempt to scientifically achieve the SDGs. Herein, we proposed four scenario assumptions based on the SDGs, including the sustainable economy (ECO), sustainable grain (GRA), sus-tainable environment (ENV), and reference (REF) scenarios. We forecasted land-use change along the Silk Road (resolution: 300 m) and compared the impacts of urban expansion and forest conversion on terres-trial carbon pools. There were significant differences in future land use change and carbon stocks, under the four SDG scenarios, by 2030. In the ENV scenario, the trend of decreasing forest land was mitigated, and forest carbon stocks in China increased by approximately 0.60% compared to 2020. In the GRA sce-nario, the decreasing rate of cultivated land area has slowed down. Cultivated land area in South and Southeast Asia only shows an increasing trend in the GRA scenario, while it shows a decreasing trend in other SDG scenarios. The ECO scenario showed highest carbon losses associated with increased urban expansion. The study enhances our understanding of how SDGs can contribute to mitigate future envi-ronmental degradation via accurate simulations that can be applied on a global scale.(c) 2023 Science China Press.

From waste to resource: demystifying the policy challenges and identifying opportunities for a circular economy in Zambia,"Policy plays a significant role in accelerating or hindering a circular shift; Governments can set long-term visions and drive legislative change to create an enabling environment. Reflecting the regional picture, Zambia is experiencing increasing waste burdens due to a growing population and economic development. The current management approach is linear, characterized by low collection rates, inadequate disposal, and limited waste revalorization. From a sustainable development perspective, how waste is managed impacts pressing issues such as climate change and public health. The concept of the Circular Economy (CE) has gained global and regional interest given its potential to transform how resources are viewed and managed. Circular strategies may help to reduce waste burdens and create local socioeconomic opportunities while safeguarding the environment. This qualitative study uses document review and expert interviews to explore the current waste management regime in Zambia and understand if and how circularity is embedded into the policy approach. The findings suggest that the CE is potentially highly relevant for Zambia, but there are various policy challenges that could impede its successful integration into the national agenda. These challenges relate to ownership and coordination; gaps in implementation and enforcement; a restrictive licensing approach; obstacles to innovation and new entrants; as well as the role of informal sector actors. The challenges point to opportunities to overturn these policy shortfalls, which also presents future research avenues.",Not About Sufficiency
From Planetary Boundaries to national fair shares of the global safe operating space - How can the scales be bridged?,"The planetary boundaries framework proposes quantitative global limits to the anthropogenic perturbation of crucial Earth system processes, and thus marks out a planetary safe operating space for human activities. Yet, decisions regarding resource use and emissions are mostly made at less aggregated scales, by national and sub-national governments, businesses, and other local actors. To operationalize the planetary boundaries concept, the boundaries need to be translated into and aligned with targets that are relevant at these decision-making scales. In this paper, we develop a framework that addresses the biophysical, socio-economic, and ethical dimensions of bridging across scales, to provide a consistently applicable approach for translating the planetary boundaries into national-level fair shares of Earth's safe operating space. We discuss our findings in the context of previous studies and their implications for future analyses and, policymaking. In this way, we link the planetary boundaries framework to widely-applied operational and policy concepts for more robust strong sustainability decision-making. (C) 2016 The Authors.

From functional diversity to human well-being: A conceptual framework for agroecosystem sustainability,"CONTEXT: Agricultural intensification contributes to global food security and well-being by supplying the food demand of a growing human population. However, ongoing land-use change and intensification seriously affect the abundance, diversity and distribution of species, besides many other impacts, thereby threatening the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. Despite the accumulating evidence that the current agricultural model is unsustainable, we are far from understanding the consequences of functional diversity loss for functioning and ecosystem service supply and the potential long-term threats to food security and human well-being.OBJECTIVE: In this review, we propose a conceptual framework to understand the relationships between func-tional diversity and human well-being that also considers agroecosystem health. To this end, we identify the most commonly assumed relationships linking functional diversity to regulating and provisioning agroecosystem services and their importance for human well-being, emphasising the most serious knowledge gaps in the in-dividual pathways of the conceptual framework.METHODS: A consortium formed by an international panel of experts from different disciplines including functional diversity, ecosystem services and human health compiled 275 articles. Members of the consortium proposed literature to exemplify each specific aspect of the conceptual framework in the text, in accordance with his/her field of expertise. The guideline for all experts was to focus mostly in current literature (38% of the references are from the last 5 years and 66% from the last decade), with special interest in reviews and synthesis articles (42% of the references), as well as meta-analyses and global studies (10% of the references).RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The factors that influence agroecosystem health are extremely complex, involving both services and disservices related to land-use management and environmental conditions. The global human population needs sustainable and resilient agroecosystems and a concerted effort is needed to fundamentally redesign agricultural practices to feed the growing human population without further jeopardising the quality of life for future generations. We highlight the potential effects of land-use change and ecological intensification on the functional diversity of plant and animal communities, and the resulting consequences for ecosystem services and ultimately human health. SIGNIFICANCE: The resulting conceptual model is developed for researchers as well as policy makers high-lighting the need for a holistic approach to understand diversity impacts on human well-being. Finally, we document a major knowledge gap due to the lack of any studies focusing on the full pathway from diversity to human well-being.",Not About Sufficiency
"From Fukushima to fossil fuels: Carbon emissions, climate narratives, and grassroots movements in Japan's energy transition","The Fukushima Nuclear Accident triggered an energy predicament in Japan, necessitating initiatives to decarbonise and denuclearise its energy landscape. This shift has intensified reliance on fossil fuels, notably coal, inciting widespread anti-coal disputes throughout the nation. This research scrutinises the dynamics of carbon emissions and their interrelation with climate activism narratives, emphasising the mobilisation of communities to confront issues of inequality and justice. Employing a club convergence methodology, this study analyses the patterns of carbon emissions from fossil fuels across 47 administrative divisions in Japan from 1990 to 2020. This quantitative analysis is enriched with a qualitative content analysis of anti-coal movements, utilising the comprehensive Global Atlas of Environmental Justice (EJAtlas) as a primary resource. The findings disclose pronounced sub-national disparities in energy transitions and carbon emissions. Narratives within anti-coal activism predominantly encompass themes of global warming, air and water pollution, social and cultural impacts, and health repercussions. We find that regions with historically high emissions predominantly embrace narratives of climate and environmental justice, whereas rural regions experiencing escalating emissions integrate these with narratives of peripheralisation. The opposition to technocratic resolutions and the endorsement for transitions to low carbon society are salient within these movements, resonating with the degrowth paradigm advocating for equitable and sustainable alternatives. This research underscores the pivotal role of social movements in mitigating regional emissions disparities and illustrates the evolution of grassroots movements towards embracing sustainable alternatives.",Not About Sufficiency

"Forests, trees and poverty alleviation: Policy implications of current knowledge","Major advances have been made over the past two decades in our understanding of the contribution forests and trees outside forests make to human well-being across the globe. Yet this knowledge has not always been incorporated into broader poverty and development policy agendas. The result is a missed opportunity to effectively and sustainably reach national and international poverty alleviation goals. Here, we address the need for greater integration of forests and trees in development policy. We distil five key findings based on the current evidence base and discuss their implications for decision-makers. We find that (1) forests and trees are critical to global efforts to end poverty but (2) their benefits to human well-being are unevenly distributed. Although the evidence indicates that (3) forests and trees can help the rural poor as they face profound global changes, it also shows that (4) poorly aligned forest and land use policies and programmes may lead to excessive costs being borne by the poor. However, we do find that (5) policy and management measures exist that can enable forests and trees to effectively address poverty goals even as there is no 'one size fits all' solution. Key overarching policy implications of these findings include the need to integrate forests and trees more explicitly into land-use planning and poverty reduction programs, strengthen forest property rights, self-governance and technical skills of forest-reliant communities, and carefully tailor policy measures to the context in which they are implemented.",Not About Sufficiency

Financing a renewable energy feed-in tariff with a tax on carbon dioxide emissions: A dynamic multi-sector general equilibrium analysis for Portugal,"Renewable energy production subsidies alleviate the pressure on electricity prices associated with carbon and energy pricing policies in the process of decarbonization and electrification of the Portuguese economy. Our simulation results show that a feed in tariff financed by a carbon tax leads to adverse macroeconomic as well as adverse and regressive distributional welfare effects. On the flip side, however, we show that use of the carbon tax revenues to finance a feed in tariff is an improvement over the simple carbon tax case along all the relevant policy dimensions. The feed in tariff mechanism when added to the carbon tax leads to better environmental outcomes at lower costs both in terms of the economic and social justice implications. The policy implications are clear. First, because of its adverse economic and distributional effects, a carbon tax should not be used in isolation. The use of the revenues to finance a feed in tariff dominates the simple carbon tax case in all dimensions. Second, the search for an appropriate recycling mechanisms beyond a feed in tariff is an issue as important as the carbon tax itself as it pertains to the potential reversal of the adverse effects of such a tax.",Not About Sufficiency
Financial Literacy Metrics for Financial Wellbeing in a Socioeconomic Environment: the FWI Model in a Circular Economy and Climate Finance,"This research aimed to investigate measurement analyses that could promote sustainable financial literacy practices, thereby enhancing financial well-being in a socioeconomic environment. It focused on examining the factors of the Financial Well-Being Index (FWI) model and identifying gaps in financial literacy within the context of a circular economy and climate finance. Confirmatory Factorial Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were employed using data collected from 402 families in Kosovo during the years 2022-2023. The analyses revealed interrelationships among financial literacy, financial well-being, and the socioeconomic environment. Strong financial behavior was associated with a reduced need for financial education, while the lack of financial balance hindered resilience and well-being. Savings positively impacted the quality of life and homeownership. Additionally, the need for financial education positively influenced financial attitude, and financial resilience indirectly affected the financial situation. Financial literacy had both direct and indirect effects on the socioeconomic environment through its impact on financial well-being.

Integrating Sustainability in Aircraft Component Design: Towards a Transition from Eco-Driven to Sustainability-Driven Design,"Eco-design is an innovative design methodology that focuses on minimizing the environmental footprint of industries, including aviation, right from the conceptual and development stages. However, rising industrial demand calls for a more comprehensive strategy wherein, beyond environmental considerations, competitiveness becomes a critical factor, supported by additional pillars of sustainability such as economic viability, circularity, and social impact. By incorporating sustainability as a primary design driver at the initial design stages, this study suggests a shift from eco-driven to sustainability-driven design approaches for aircraft components. This expanded strategy considers performance and safety goals, environmental impact, costs, social factors, and circular economy considerations. To provide the most sustainable design that balances all objectives, these aspects are rigorously quantified and optimized during the design process. To efficiently prioritize different variables, methods such as multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) are employed, and a sustainability index is developed in this framework to assess the overall sustainability of each design alternative. The most sustainable design configurations are then identified through an optimization process. A typical aircraft component, namely a hat-stiffened panel, is selected to demonstrate the proposed approach. The study highlights how effectively sustainability considerations can be integrated from the early stages of the design process by exploring diverse material combinations and geometric configurations. The findings indicate that the type of fuel used, and the importance given to the sustainability pillars—which are ultimately determined by the particular requirements and goals of the user—have a significant impact on the sustainability outcome. When equal prioritization is given across the diverse dimensions of sustainability, the most sustainable option appears to be the full thermoplastic component when kerosene is used. Conversely, when hydrogen is considered, the full aluminum component emerges as the most sustainable choice. This trend also holds when environmental impact is prioritized over the other aspects of sustainability. However, when costs are prioritized, the full thermoplastic component is the most sustainable option, whether hydrogen or kerosene is used as the fuel in the use phase. This innovative approach enhances the overall sustainability of aircraft components, emphasizing the importance and benefits of incorporating a broader range of sustainability factors at the conceptual and initial design phases.",Not About Sufficiency

This article elucidates the complex and intertwining legal, political, and policy avenues that corporations use to advance their interests under the guise of promoting renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions. As this case demonstrates, the fate of public health and environmental protection lies in often ambiguous and contested definitions of what is renewable, what counts as an incinerator, and who has standing and prosecutorial discretion.

Strategies to save energy in the context of the energy crisis: a review,"New technologies, systems, societal organization and policies for energy saving are urgently needed in the context of accelerated climate change, the Ukraine conflict and the past coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. For instance, concerns about market and policy responses that could lead to new lock-ins, such as investing in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and using all available fossil fuels to compensate for Russian gas supply cuts, may hinder decarbonization efforts. Here we review energy-saving solutions with a focus on the actual energy crisis, green alternatives to fossil fuel heating, energy saving in buildings and transportation, artificial intelligence for sustainable energy, and implications for the environment and society. Green alternatives include biomass boilers and stoves, hybrid heat pumps, geothermal heating, solar thermal systems, solar photovoltaics systems into electric boilers, compressed natural gas and hydrogen. We also detail case studies in Germany which is planning a 100% renewable energy switch by 2050 and developing the storage of compressed air in China, with emphasis on technical and economic aspects. The global energy consumption in 2020 was 30.01% for the industry, 26.18% for transport, and 22.08% for residential sectors. 10–40% of energy consumption can be reduced using renewable energy sources, passive design strategies, smart grid analytics, energy-efficient building systems, and intelligent energy monitoring. Electric vehicles offer the highest cost-per-kilometer reduction of 75% and the lowest energy loss of 33%, yet battery-related issues, cost, and weight are challenging. 5–30% of energy can be saved using automated and networked vehicles. Artificial intelligence shows a huge potential in energy saving by improving weather forecasting and machine maintenance and enabling connectivity across homes, workplaces, and transportation. For instance, 18.97–42.60% of energy consumption can be reduced in buildings through deep neural networking.

The demand for renewable energy is increasing, despite power scarcity, pollution, and climate change posing challenges to long-term development in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has seen significant social and economic growth in recent years. To achieve its 23% renewable energy (RE) target, ASEAN can develop solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity. Members of the ASEAN have established regulations and incentives to encourage individuals and businesses to use renewable energy in the future. This paper explores Southeast Asian countries’ comprehensive fossil-free energy options, the region’s renewable energy potential, current capacity, goals, and energy needs. Through the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) 2016–2025 and the ASEAN Declaration on Renewable Energy, ASEAN is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development aligning with the Paris Agreement’s aim to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Results show that decarbonizing the region’s energy system is possible, but current policies and actions must be altered to reach that target level. Further research is necessary to optimize the ASEAN region’s renewable resource technical potential and commercial viability with available technology.",Not About Sufficiency

Exploring the relationship between land use change patterns and variation in environmental factors within urban agglomeration,"Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 aims to promote a more livable urban environment for humanity. However, the rapid global urbanization process has exerted significant pressure on urban environment, posing challenges for many cities to achieve this target. The urbanization process within urban agglomeration is accompanied by rapid and diverse land use change. Exploring the relationship between land use change and environmental factors is crucial for achieving sustainable urban development. To address this issue, this study investigates the interactive relationship between pixel-scale land use change and environmental indicators (CO2, Land Surface Temperature, and PM2.5) in China's three major urban agglomerations from 2000 to 2020. This study aims to analyze major land use change patterns, explore intrinsic connections among environmental indicators, and assess the impact of land use change on these indicators. The findings show that cropland, forestland, and built-up land are the major types of land change in all three urban agglomerations. Regions characterized by high population density, heavy industry, and intense transportation exhibit more pollutant emissions. Rapid urban construction has resulted in different types of environmental degradation issues. This study provides a comprehensive examination of the relationship between urbanization and environmental issues.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring Sustainable Development Goal Research Trajectories in Small Island Developing States,"This study investigates the alignment of research on small island developing states (SIDSs) with sustainable development goals (SDGs), identifying key focus areas, interdisciplinary connections, research gaps, thematic clusters, and insights from case studies. By employing a mixed methods research design that combines quantitative scientometric analysis with qualitative case studies, this unique study examines the nexus between SIDS research and its contribution to SDGs. The findings reveal that SDG 13 (climate action) and SDG 14 (life below water) dominate SIDS research, emphasizing the need to address climate challenges and marine biodiversity. Economic aspects are underscored by SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), while urban development and inequality are addressed through SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). Renewable energy and food security are focal points in SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 2 (zero hunger). Moderate research outputs in SDG 3 (good health and well-being) and SDG 15 (life on land) suggest a holistic approach, while lower activity in SDGs 16 (peace), 6 (clean water), 4 (education), and 5 (gender) presents opportunities for further exploration. SIDS research is highly interdisciplinary, as seen through three distinct SDG networks: foundational social goals, economic and environmental objectives, and environmental preservation. The thematic clusters in SIDS research include environmental challenges and adaptation, public health, and socioeconomic development, and energy policy and environmental economics. Case studies from various SIDSs illustrate the complex interplay between environmental sustainability, economic development, and social well-being, highlighting the importance of tailored approaches, international cooperation, and local community engagement. These findings underscore the need for integrated research strategies to address the complex challenges of SIDSs, emphasizing climate action, sustainable economic practices, and comprehensive development approaches to achieve the SDGs effectively.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring Factors Influencing Renewable Energy Diffusion in Commercial Buildings in Nigeria: A Grounded Theory Approach,"The adoption and integration of renewable energy technologies (RETs) into buildings is key to making the necessary transition to low-carbon and resilient built environments. However, such technologies have struggled to gain a firm foothold in countries within the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. This is particularly the case in Nigeria, which suffers from severe energy poverty, despite its significant RE and conventional energy potential. In Nigeria, a significant proportion of the energy demand for offices is provided by self-powered off-grid fossil-fuel generators. The country is also one of the primary settings for increased construction activity. This, combined with its susceptibility to the effects of climate change, presents significant concerns relating to the resilience of its built environment. However, there has not yet been a comprehensive empirical study addressing this, as previous studies have been limited in their insight and perspectives. This study adopted a grounded theory method (GTM) aligned with Charmaz's approach, to gain in-depth participant-driven insights into factors influencing sustainable energy use in commercial buildings, focusing on solar photovoltaics (PVs). This led to the development of a theory of the sustainability transition process of construction professionals (CPs). It provides relevant, reliable, and relatable points of reference that would be beneficial to policymakers in developing plans for actionable interventions for PV and broader sustainable measures toward green energy transition. Furthermore, it highlights the value of employing GTMs in construction management research beyond the developing context. This paper contributes theoretically, empirically, and methodologically to facilitate a better understanding of the situations (context) grounded in empirical data.",Not About Sufficiency
"Exploring Current Trends, Gaps & Challenges in Sustainable Food Systems Studies: The Need of Developing Urban Food Systems Frameworks for Sustainable Cities","The current global food system is under threat due to significant global changes such as rapid urbanization, climate change, COVID-19 outbreak, etc. The importance of food system sustainability as a key element of sustainable cities has been gradually recognized in recent years; however, the tools for estimating food system sustainability in cities (i.e., urban food system sustainability) holistically are still scarce. Thus, this study represents a comprehensive investigation into food system studies and their impacts on achieving a sustainable community or city. This study is a subset of larger studies that aim to develop an urban food system framework, which utilizes modern approaches in framework development such as sustainability food indicators and a participatory approach. However, to achieve this, trends, gaps, and challenges of the current approach to food system studies need to be reviewed and discussed. A systematic analysis utilizing the protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was conducted, and network analysis of publications was performed via VOS viewer. The results suggest applying circular principles and merging smartness and resilience thinking in developing strategies for food system sustainability. This study finds that key drivers to mitigate food crisis among countries vary. Furthermore, a context-specific framework with a more comprehensive definition of urban food systems covering the institutional processes, and food governance are also needed to achieve urban food system sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Explore Associations between Subjective Well-Being and Eco-Logical Footprints with Fixed Effects Panel Regressions,"As environmental degradations constantly and directly threaten human well-being, it is imperative to explore the environmental impacts on people's happy life. This research investigates the association between subjective well-being (SWB) and ecological footprints (EF) through space-time fixed effects panel regressions. EF, as a vital indicator of environmentally sustainable development, plays a vital role in ecological balance. SWB determines the subjective quality of life for humanity. EF-related factors and socio-economic indexes referring to GDP, urbanization rate, income, education, health, political stability, and political voice accountability in 101 countries were captured. Compared with ordinary least square (OLS), stepwise regression (SR) and fixed effects panel regression models (FEPR) exhibited good fitness regardless of the cross-section or longitudinal models due to R2 beyond 0.9. The finding also discloses that EF and health were positively significant to SWB, while income was negatively significant to SWB. EF was an invert u-shaped link to SWB, which met the assumption of EKC. This research provided a model-driven quantitative method to address environmental impacts on people's quality life of happiness, and opened shared doors for further research of carbon balance and circular economy.",Not About Sufficiency
"Examining the interplay between green technology, co2 emissions, and life expectancy in the asean-5 countries: insights from the panel FMOLS and DOLS approaches","Conference of Parties (COP28) emphasized the critical need to support vulnerable nations, particularly in Southeast Asia, by addressing climate change and enhancing climate finance mechanisms, which are vital for the overall well-being of their citizens. In response, we used the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS), and Cross Sectional Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) techniques to examine the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, green technology, and health expenditures on life expectancy in five Southeast Asian countries (ASEAN-5) from 1995 to 2020. Although there is a considerable body of work on the factors that affect life expectancy, this study closes a major gap in the literature by concentrating on the ASEAN-5 nations, which have not received enough attention in studies on life expectancy. Specifically, incorporating factors such as green technology, CO2 emissions, and health expenditure, which were not considered in those earlier analyses. The CS-ARDL results reveal that green technology could significantly enhance life expectancy, while CO2 emissions could have a significantly negative impact on life expectancy. The heterogeneous results of the FMOLS and DOLS also show that heightened health expenditure significantly enhances life expectancy in Thailand and the Philippines, advocating for increased investments in healthcare infrastructure. Economic expansion emerges as a significant contributor to enhanced life expectancy in Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore, emphasizing the importance of policies fostering sustainable economic development. Notably, adopting green technology correlates positively with increased life expectancy in Singapore and the Philippines, emphasizing the dual benefits of environmentally sustainable practices. Conversely, CO2 emissions exhibit a consistent negative correlation with life expectancy across all ASEAN-5 countries, underscoring the imperative for robust environmental policies to safeguard public health. Based on the results, we recommend that policymakers in the ASEAN-5 prioritize healthcare investments and adopt sustainable economic strategies, such as promoting clean energy and circular economies. In addition, targeted incentives for green technology, including tax breaks for renewable energy investments and subsidies for carbon capture research, should also be implemented to mitigate CO2 emissions while enhancing economic resilience, public health, and life expectancy across the region.",Not About Sufficiency
Examining the effect of economic complexity on energy justice,"A clean and healthy environment is necessary to achieve other Sustainable Development Goals. Policymakers must find ways to minimize carbon dioxide emissions and global warming before the Sustainable Development era expires. These ills are compounded by chronic inequalities in access to clean energy and the distribution of energy infrastructure, costs, and benefits. This underscores the importance of examining, addressing, and preventing various inequalities in the energy sector. Thus, this paper endeavours to examine probably for the first time the effect of economic complexity on energy justice in a panel of 62 countries over the past decade. The measure of energy justice in this study is a rarely used indicator constructed from a range of 21 sub indicators. We also use three sub-indices of energy justice: distributive justice, procedural justice, and restorative justice. The empirical analyses based on a range of robust estimation approaches consistently provide strong evidence that, on average, economic complexity improves energy justice and its three sub components. Finally, the results from the mediation analysis show that the positive effect of economic complexity on energy justice mediates through income, and human capital. Based on these results, some policy recommendations are made for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, and 16.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating the sustainability of the hydrogen economy using multi-criteria decision-making analysis in Korea,"South Korea announced a hydrogen economy roadmap and hydrogen regulations aligned with its decarbonization plan. However, the environmental, economic, and social sustainability of the hydrogen economy in South Korea has not been thoroughly studied. Under the Energy Trilemma framework, we compared the positive and negative impacts of hydrogen with other energy carriers, including nuclear, coal, gas, and renewables. The selected evaluation criteria included the energy return on energy investment, greenhouse gas emissions, levelized cost of electricity, import dependency, and long-term energy storage. As a result, we argue that green hydrogen improves environmental sustainability and energy security by reducing the carbon emission intensity of the energy sector and energy dependency on imported sources. We propose three critical policy implications to maximize the benefits of hydrogen while minimizing its negative economic impact. First, the rapid expansion of renewables, particularly large-scale wind power, is required. Second, clean hydrogen portfolio standards must be aligned with South Korea's decarbonization plan. Third, governmental investment in research and development activities and demonstration projects will reduce hydrogen production costs by maximizing the utilization of renewable resources.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating the impacts of reforming and integrating China's electricity sector,"Addressing the efficiency-equity-environment trade-off is an important part of implementing electricity sector reform. To support China's electricity market reform, this study conducts an ex-ante analysis to quantify the economic, distributional and environmental effects of marketization and integration. Three scenarios are designed based on the current reform progress and possible reform directions, including a planning scenario, a provincial market scenario and a regional market scenario. Using high-frequency data of electricity load, production and trade from five southern Chinese provinces in 2018, we quantify the impacts on electricity generation mix, wholesale prices, carbon emissions and social welfare. The potential welfare improvement achieved from establishing provincial markets is 14.3 billion yuan, which could be further increased to 21.0 billion yuan by integrating the provincial markets into a regional market. The regional average wholesale price could be reduced by 23.5% 22.7% and (regional market) (provincial market), respectively. The carbon emissions could be reduced by about 12.4 million tons (2.4%) in the provincial market scenario and 16.6 million tons (3.2%) in the regional market scenario. Moreover, individual provinces are affected heterogeneously from the marketization and integration, and the potential winners and losers have been identified from market reform. The regional market performs better than the provincial market in terms of overall efficiency gains and environmental outcomes but worse in addressing equity concerns.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating equity and justice in low-carbon energy transitions,"A low-carbon energy transition is essential for mitigating climate change, but can also cause energy justice and equity impacts on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), low-income, and other frontline communities. Examples include exacerbating energy burden, inaccessibility and unaffordability of low-carbon energy and electric end-use technologies, property value loss and displacement from renewable energy siting, and unequal health benefits and employment losses from fossil fuel retirement. To avoid perpetuating historical and creating new injustices, an equitable and just energy transition will require careful planning and execution. To this end, measuring and evaluating the effects of existing and proposed programs and policies aimed at decarbonizing energy systems is critical. However, methods and metrics for evaluating equity effects vary across disciplines and transitions, making it challenging to identify effective evaluation strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the equity implications of low-carbon energy transitions and identifies key metrics that have been used across disciplines to quantify energy injustices and equity impacts. We focus on four key low-carbon energy transitions: (1) renewable energy deployment; (2) fossil fuel infrastructure retirement; (3) transportation electrification; and (4) residential building decarbonization. We classify energy justice and equity metrics into the dimensions of health, access, and livelihood, and construct an analytical framework that supports policymakers, planners and other stakeholders in identifying important equity considerations and quantitatively evaluating the effects of decarbonization initiatives. While our framework can serve as a starting point for evaluating justice and equity impacts of energy transitions, further work is needed to address the limitations of existing metrics and additional evaluation methods will be critical to effect energy transitions that are truly equitable.",Not About Sufficiency
Equitable deep decarbonization: A framework to facilitate energy justice-based multidisciplinary modeling,"Persistent, systemic harms have resulted in inequalities in wealth distribution, energy insecurity, infrastructure reliability, heat island exposure, and preexisting health conditions, all of which have exacerbated climate change driven damages.

Doing so requires a multidisciplinary approach to assess the tradeoffs between alternative decarbonization pathways. In this Perspective we introduce an Equitable Deep Decarbonization Framework for mapping the tenets of energy justice to the practice of large-scale deep decarbonization pathways modeling designed to facilitate this multidisciplinary effort. We provide discussion of key considerations for each step of the framework to enable modeling that accounts for adaptation co-benefits associated with systematic climate risks to vulnerable communities.",Not About Sufficiency
Enzymes in the bioconversion of food waste into valuable bioproducts: A circular economy perspective,"The escalating global challenges of food security, waste management, and environmental sustainability have necessitated the application of novel green approaches to utilize agro-industrial food waste as a valuable bioresource. Enzymatic conversion of food waste into high-value bioproducts emerges as one of the promising solutions to address these issues. The current review explores the critical role of enzymes in facilitating the conversion of diverse agro-industrial residues, including those from plants and animals, into biochemicals and functional ingredients. The current review evaluates the environmental and economic benefits of enzyme-mediated bioconversion processes, underlining the circular economy paradigm, which prioritizes resource efficiency and waste minimization. The enzyme production from diverse plant and animal-based food wastes as raw materials has been highlighted beside the description of different bioproducts from food waste using enzymes and the integration of enzymatic bioprocessing. The economic analysis and case studies of the enzyme-mediated processes for biochemical production from food waste have also been emphasized. By harnessing the synergistic potential of enzymes and circular economy principles, the bioconversion of agro-industrial food waste into novel bioproducts presents a viable pathway toward sustainable resource utilization and a circular bioeconomy.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental sustainability: a clean energy aspect versus poverty,"Poverty reduction and environmental sustainability are the two significant challenges the world needs to cope with in the twenty-first century worldwide. Environmental impact is a constraint in the path of poverty alleviation and sustainable development, as well.

"Environmental preservation amidst carbon emissions, energy consumption, and urbanization in selected african countries: Implication for sustainability","On the quest for a clean and sustainable environment, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 stipulates the need to reduce carbon emissions, decarbonize the energy system, improve energy consumption and ensure the attainment of sustainable energy. In the same vein, SDG 9 pertains to the prevention of environmental degradation, promoting biodiversity and preserving the ecosystem to support inclusive human and economic development. Given the hazardous impact of carbon emissions, if left unabated, and the benefits of preserving nature's ecosystem, the motivation for this study hinges on analyzing factors that threaten a sustainable environment using two proxies of environmental degradation: carbon emissions and ecological footprint. With a battery of static and dynamic econometric techniques on a sample of 44 selected African countries from 1992 to 2016, findings reveal the following: (1) energy usage deteriorates the environment, and (2) urbanization has asymmetric effects on the environment. Controlling for per capita GDP, financial development and gross fixed capital formation, evidence suggests that per capita GDP has an asymmetric impact, financial development accelerates environmental degradation, while gross fixed capital formation intensifies a sustainable environment.

Environmental Justice Specialization and Corporate ESG Performance: Evidence from China Environmental Protection Court,"In order to implement the dual-carbon strategy and achieve sustainable economic development, it is essential to guarantee environmental protection through the establishment of an effective environmental rule of law. This study employs a quasi-natural experiment, namely the establishment of environmental protection courts in China's intermediate people's courts, to investigate the impact on the ESG performance of A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2022. A double-difference model is utilized for this purpose. This study reveals that the specialization of environmental justice is an effective means of promoting the ESG performance of enterprises. The results of mechanism tests indicate that the specialization of environmental justice has a positive impact on the ESG performance of enterprises, primarily by enhancing external supervision and garnering greater media attention and analyst interest. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis reveals that the influence of environmental justice specialization on corporate ESG performance is particularly pronounced in eastern regions, contexts characterized by high environmental uncertainty and heavily polluting enterprises.

Environmental Justice and Health in Nigeria,"Purpose of ReviewThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) identified 17 goals to achieve by the year 2030, with many of these goals directly or indirectly linked to environmental justice. Health outcomes remain poor in Nigeria; the country ranks low in environmental quality despite supporting environmental treaties and laws. The burden of diseases in the country is in part related to poor environmental quality and is linked to environmental justice issues, such as mining, energy exploration, transport emission, poor waste management, and proliferation of slum settlement.Recent FindingsPrevious studies found that living in proximity to mines and environmental degradation of land and water disrupts means of livelihood and causes poor health outcomes among children and adults. Specifically, health issues like respiratory illness, malaria, kidney disease, and high blood pressure are likely consequences of proximity to mine waste. Few published studies are available for a developing country like Nigeria, although the link between environmental justice and health in Nigeria is clear enough to require action on the part of the government and polluting industries.SummaryThis paper reviewed the concept and coverage of environmental justice in the Nigerian context and its impact on health. Addressing environmental injustices related to mining and other environmental issues can accelerate health gains through conscious and concerted efforts towards preserving the environment.

Environmental justice and REDD plus safeguards in Laos: Lessons from an authoritarian political regime,"Balancing agendas for climate mitigation and environmental justice continues to be one of the key challenges in climate change governance mechanisms, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). In this paper we apply the three-dimensional environmental justice framework as a lens to examine the REDD+ process in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) and the REDD+ social safeguards. We focus particularly on challenges to justice faced by marginalized communities living in forest frontier areas under an authoritarian regime. Drawing on policy analysis and open-ended interviews across different policy levels, we explore procedural, distributional, and recognitional justice across the REDD+ policy levels in Laos. We find that REDD+ social safeguards have been applied by both donors and state actors in ways that facilitate external control. We underscore how authoritarian regime control over civil society and ethnic minority groups thwarts justice. We also highlight how this political culture and lack of inclusiveness are used by donors and project managers to implement their projects with little political debate. Further obstacles to justice relate to limitations inherent in the REDD+ instrument, including tight schedules for dealing with highly sensitive socio-political issues under social safeguards. These findings echo other research but go further in questioning the adequacy of safeguards to promote justice under a nationally driven REDD+. We highlight the importance of recognition and political context, including aspects such as power relations, self-determination and self-governance of traditional or customary structures, in shaping justice outcomes.",Not About Sufficiency
Environmental justice and the SDGs: from synergies to gaps and contradictions,"Through their synergies, trade-offs, and contradictions, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) have the potential to lead to environmental justices and injustices. Yet, environmental justice (EJ), and social justice more broadly, are not currently embedded within the language and spirit of the SDGs. We part from the premise that ""many 'environmental' problems are, by their very nature, problems of justice"" (Lele, Wiley Interdiscip Rev Water 4:e1224, 2017). We review progress in EJ frameworks in recent years, arguing for the need to move beyond a focus on the four principles of mainstream EJ (distribution, procedure, recognition, and capabilities) towards a more intersectional decolonial approach to environmental justice that recognises the indispensability of both humans and non-humans. EJ frameworks, and the SDGs should recognise power dynamics, complex interactions among injustices, and listens to the different 'senses of justice' and desires of theorists, activists, and other stakeholder from the Global South. We analyze how EJ frameworks are, or fail to be, incorporated in the SDGs with a focus on the food-water-health nexus (SDG2, 3, 6); climate-energy (SDG7, 13), conservation (SDG14, 15); and poverty and inequality (SDG1, 10). We call attention to the 'elephant in the room'-the failure to go beyond GDP but instead include economic growth as a goal (SDG8). We argue that sustainable degrowth and intersectional decolonial environmental justices would create better conditions for the transformative changes needed to reach the broader aim of the SDGs: to leave no one behind.",Not About Sufficiency

Environmental justice research shows the importance of social feedbacks in ecosystem service trade-offs,"In this article, we shine a spotlight on approaches to research ecosystem service trade-offs and critically assess their representation of relevant social dynamics. Although studies linking ecosystem services and human well-being have provided theoretical insights into social and ecological trade-offs, we argue that ecosystem services research has paid insufficient attention to ""social feedbacks,"" people's cognitive and behavioral responses to change. We demonstrate that augmenting ecosystem services research with environmental justice approaches (exploring perceptions of the distribution of costs and benefits, decision making procedures, and recognition of different values and identities) can more effectively capture important responses to ecosystem governance. Spatial analysis of land use change, mixed-method assessment of multidimensional well-being, and qualitative environmental justice research were applied in three villages adjacent to Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area in northern Laos. Spatial analysis showed that, from 2006 to 2015, forest clearance for cultivation remained stable within the protected area. Well-being assessment revealed the local population benefited from rapidly increasing incomes, asset ownership, and reduced poverty during that time. In combination, spatial and well-being analyses paint a picture of limited trade-offs, despite growing incentives to exploit protected land and resources through cash crops and high-value forest products. In contrast, results from environmental justice research revealed profound trade-offs between conservation and local practices, and highlight governance deficiencies relating to procedure and recognition. Consequently, formal protected area rules were perceived to be illegitimate by many and actively undermined, for example through negotiated access with alternative authorities. We conclude that although well-being research provides an essential foundation to understand diverse attachments to natural resources, the addition of environmental justice research can reveal local perceptions and social feedbacks critical to ecosystem service trade-offs, and highlight pathways to reconcile them through satisfying stakeholders' diverse, dynamic objectives.",Not About Sufficiency

Ensuring a just transition: The electric vehicle revolution from a human rights perspective,"Despite the potential of electric vehicles (EVs) to mitigate climate change and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, their rapid adoption presents nuanced challenges to both social equity and environmental stewardship within the transportation sector. While the EV revolution contributes to energy independence, job creation, and sustainable development, it also raises concerns regarding its potential impact on the human rights of people impacted by the production, use, and end -of -life of EVs. Unfortunately, current studies on transportation electrification often fail to provide a systematic review of such human rights challenges and concerns. This paper aims to fill this gap by analyzing the potential impacts and challenges that EVs present for human rights throughout their life cycle, and by proposing potential measures to address human rights violations. Our analysis draws on international human rights norms, law, and standards because of their universality and suitability for developing baseline indicators, modes of inquiry, and reporting that can be used to assess the potential harm of EVs to vulnerable communities and degraded ecosystems. The aim is to enable stakeholders (i.e., actors within civil society, government, and the private sector) to better understand the potential social and environmental challenges of EVs and ensure that the transition to low -carbon transportation is equitable, sustainable, and supportive of human rights.",Not About Sufficiency
Enhancing food security and environmental sustainability: A critical review of food loss and waste management,"Food loss and waste (FLW) occurs at each and every stage of the food supply chain.

Energy-Sufficiency for a Just Transition: A Systematic Review,"Efforts to achieve an energy transition often neglect to account for the levelling of benefits realizable with higher levels of energy use, despite knowledge of a saturation effect and recognition of increasing harms of use. This research examines energy sufficiency as a maximum quantity of energy associated with improvements in human well-being to inform a recalibration of energy targets among high-energy societies. A systematic review of recent research was performed to identify the point at which increasing levels of energy use no longer correlate with meaningful increases in well-being. For selected studies (n = 18), energy sufficiency values range from 60-221 gigajoules per capita per year with a mean of 132 gigajoules per capita per year for associated measures of well-being. The review finds agreement in a pattern of saturation and provides a range of values for energy sufficiency maximums, suggesting that a relatively modest amount and a diverse quality of energy is needed to support high levels of human well-being. Beyond the conventional emphasis on energy efficiency and renewable energy, energy sufficiency therefore offers a necessary and complementary approach for supporting just and ecological energy transitions.",Not About Sufficiency

What does this literature reveal about the injustices and inequalities of energy transitions? Finally, what can we learn by integrating aspects of this literature? The study answers these questions by drawing from responsible research and innovation, social practice theory, and energy justice approaches. Essentially the first is about the design of technology, the second how it is used, the third the broader societal and global implications. Taken together, the study offers an integrative framework capable of analyzing transitions from their ""cradle"" of design to their ""life"" of use to their ""grave"" of aftereffects.

In fact, most studies focus on a single region's approach to sustainability. However, this research directly compares China and the European Union (EU), highlighting how factors like economic structure and development stages influence the effectiveness of renewable energy and circular economy practices. Also, this study shows how renewable energy and circular practices can simultaneously tackle both environmental damage (emissions) and social issues (poverty). Our findings reveal that factors like poverty, fossil fuel reliance, economic growth, and international trade all contribute to rising carbon emissions in both China and the EU, though their influence varies. Interestingly, China experienced greater success in curbing emissions through solar power, circular economy measures, and wind power compared to the EU. Additionally, the impact of these strategies on poverty reduction differed significantly between the two regions. Based on these results, we recommend that policy makers in both regions develop tailored strategies for tackling carbon emissions and poverty. Prioritizing renewable energy sources and circular practices is key, as they can simultaneously reduce emissions and alleviate poverty. However, it is crucial to focus on approaches that work best in each specific region, considering social, economic, and environmental factors. This study suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work for fighting climate change and poverty. While renewable energy and circular economies are effective, China saw greater success with solar and wind power compared to the EU. Policy makers need to design strategies specific to their region's economic, social, and environmental context. Further research can refine these approaches, and public education is crucial to promote sustainable behavior and empower policy makers. It is also needed to refine and improve the implementation of these strategies. Finally, public awareness and education are essential to promote sustainable behavior and empower policy makers in their fight against climate change and poverty. This study highlights the importance of a region-specific approach to energy transition and poverty alleviation. By comparing China and the EU, we gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of different strategies in tackling these interconnected challenges. The findings provide valuable guidance for policy makers looking to create a more sustainable and equitable future.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy Poverty and Low Carbon Just Energy Transition: Comparative Study in Lithuania and Greece,"EU has set ambitious commitment to achieve low carbon energy and economy transition up to 2050. This low carbon transition means sustainable energy development path based on renewable energy sources and first of all should address the energy poverty vulnerability and justice issues. The main goal of the paper is to develop indicators framework for assessing low carbon just energy transition and to apply this framework for analysis how climate change mitigation policies in households targeting enhancement of energy renovation of residential buildings and promotion of the use of micro-generation technologies and other policies are affecting household's energy poverty and vulnerability in selected countries: Lithuania and Greece. This framework allows to assess three main dimensions of sustainable energy development: environmental, social and economic.

Energy policy for energy sovereignty: Can policy tools enhance energy sovereignty?,"The concept of energy sovereignty redefines the priorities for decision making regarding energy systems while encouraging increased reliance on renewable energy technologies like solar. Energy sovereignty involves centering the inherent right of humans and communities to make decisions about the energy systems they use, including decisions about the sources, scales, and forms of ownership that structure energy access. Current U.S energy policy does not center concerns of energy sovereignty, and in many cases may work against it. Policies to enhance energy sovereignty can accelerate electricity decarbonization while also empowering community scale decision making and offering communities control to reduce the myriad externalities associated with the fossil-fuel energy system.",Not About Sufficiency
"Energy Justice, Decarbonization, and the Clean Energy Transformation","Addressing climate change will require significant reductions in carbon emissions. Decarbonization will likely lead to increases in energy prices, which are regressive. Poorer households spend a higher percentage of income on energy and also have less access to energy efficient options in housing, transportation (including electric vehicles), and household durables. This review summarizes the state of knowledge on the energy justice implications of the clean energy transformation along four dimensions-production of energy, energy insecurity/energy poverty, access to clean energy technologies, and impacts of policy instrument choices for achieving decarbonization. Along each dimension there is evidence of greater negative impacts on lower-income households and on Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) households, even controlling for income. But there is also evidence that these impacts can be mitigated through policy choices. Together these findings highlight that centering justice concerns in policy debates is critical for a just and clean energy transformation.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy justice within low-carbon circular economy; geostatistical analysis; policymaking; and economical nexuses,"During the recent shift to renewable energy, this article explores the interplay between the low-carbon and circular economies, illuminating the ways in which these ideas can work together to build a more sustainable future. Achieving justice during the energy transition, promoting low-carbon energies through the use of renewable and green technology, and incorporating circular economy principles into this transition are the three primary areas covered in the review. The article advocates for a balanced approach to achieve just energy transitions by highlighting various aspects of injustice in this process and offering solutions based on evidence from recent studies. Furthermore, it stresses the need of controlling the lifetime of renewable energy devices in a way that is consistent with the circular economy's disposal and recycling strategies. The data shows that there are income, energy, renewable energy, and carbon emissions disparities all over the world. It stresses the importance of fair policies in bringing about a fair shift to low-carbon energy. To sum up, this study shows that to reach sustainable development goals, we need a holistic strategy that incorporates both the circular economy and the just transition to low-carbon energy.",Not About Sufficiency
"Energy justice within, between and beyond European community energy initiatives: A review","Recent European policy efforts stimulate the emergence of community energy initiatives, and the European Commission explicitly aims to enable a just transition towards a low-carbon energy system. One of the prevalent assumptions is that fostering community energy will bring about energy justice. Intrigued by this assumption, we conduct an extending systematic literature review to explore how the notion of energy justice is discussed within scholarly work on community energy initiatives in Europe. We detected a tendency of community energy scholars to not (yet) fully employ the inherent scope the concept of energy justice entails. Therefore, we propose that community energy justice should be analyzed through three different lenses: energy justice occurring within community energy initiatives, between initiatives and related actors, and beyond initiatives. Extending the energy justice lens to address these different levels helps to better bring out the encompassing premise that the notion of energy justice entails, both analytically and in practice. Through our analysis different energy justice impacts come to the fore, for example related to social inequality: not all societal groups are equally positioned to benefit from policies focused on community initiatives. Considering the policy efforts to stimulate community energy development, we argue that these impacts can be amplified, due to cumulative power of many community energy initiatives together. Our contribution highlights that for making energy transitions just, a broader and more connected understanding of energy justice in the context of community energy initiatives is central.",Not About Sufficiency
"Energy justice in the developing world: a review of theoretical frameworks, key research themes and policy implications","Energy justice, building on foundations within both the field of environmental justice and wider justice scholarship, has grown rapidly as a research field over recent years. However, the dominant energy justice theoretical frameworks, and many of the field's core case studies, originate from work in developed countries, with energy justice research only recently spreading to new areas of the world. This paper thus systematically reviews the current state of 'developing economy' and 'economy in transition' literature in the energy justice field. In doing this we analyse the (1) methods, energy types and locations explored thus far, unearthing key gaps, as well as (2) the multitude of 'justice-led' theoretical frameworks used. We also identify core themes illuminated by energy justice research in the developingworld, including: (3) decentralisation, access and sustainability, (4) exposing institutional instability and corruption, (5) acknowledging marginalised communities and gender inequalities, while extracting key (6) policy implications. Vital questions are raised for the continued advancement of energy justice research into new contexts and thus its conceptual evolution. Our review highlights the potential for energy justice-led attention to expand current institutional, contextual and empirical scope in specific ways, including greater attention to the poorest global regions, and certain energy technologies including nuclear and CCS. We suggest four ways in which future theoretical developments of the field might take place: (i) greater attention to spatial analyses of neglected regions; (ii) expanding the field to further include nonwestern philosophical traditions; (iii) more work on applying tenets, frameworks and principles specific to energy justice and (iv) systems approaches to developed-developing country relations, with an emphasis on how they relate to low-carbon transitions. Thus, while we explore past and present applications of energy justice in developing world contexts, we also offer guidance on the ways in which it could be applied in the future, alongside encouraging dialogue between different 'justice' fields.

Energy justice in the transition to low carbon energy systems: Exploring key themes in interdisciplinary research,"With the dual challenges of reducing emissions from fossil fuels and providing access to clean and affordable energy, there is an imperative for a transition to a low carbon energy system. The transition must take into consideration questions of energy justice to ensure that policies, plans and programmes guarantee fair and equitable access to resources and technologies. An energy justice framework is outlined to account for distributional, procedural and recognition inequalities, as well as emerging themes such as cosmopolitan and non Western understandings of justice, in decision-making relating to energy systems. The spectrum of research offers critical perspectives on the energy transition as well as tools for decision-making and policy processes. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods all contribute to our understanding of the problems and the success of responses. The studies presented in this special issue illustrate that the field of energy justice is a rapidly growing arena. There is constant innovation taking place in enabling the transition with new structures, processes and metrics being introduced to guide decision-making and a more holistic view of the community emerging where acceptance, mobilisation and empowerment are opening possibilities for a just transition to a low carbon energy system.

Energy justice and gaps in sustainable development: A convergence testing and clustering study,"The purpose of the study is to examine the dynamics of carbon emissions inequality and its effect on energy justice, whether carbon footprints have increased or decreased across countries, sectors, and households over time. We use convergence analysis, which is a methodology that effectively reveals carbon footprint dynamics. Our database contained carbon footprint data from different sectors across 180 countries between 1980 and 2020. We account for the non-linearity of the carbon footprint convergence or divergence process over time and individual heterogeneity across countries and sectors (data pre-filtering, carbon footprint convergence testing, and club clustering). Our results demonstrate a significant disparity in carbon footprints across various sectors and countries, especially among the top 1 % of earners. The wealthiest individuals worldwide have not converged towards a common trajectory, indicating high levels of carbon footprint inequality. This investigation assumes that the carbon footprint convergence or divergence process is not linear over time, allowing for fluc-tuations in carbon emissions inequality. Future research may explore the factors contributing to this non-linearity and its implications for energy justice. Our findings highlight global cooperation's importance in promoting sustainable production practices and a fair distribution of energy-related responsibilities. Energy production and consumption burdens are not equitably distributed, posing a significant challenge to achieving energy justice. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of carbon emissions inequality and its impact on energy justice. It employs a unique methodology and a multidimensional database, providing new insights into the carbon footprint disparity across sectors and countries.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy innovation funding and social equity: Mediating role of just energy transition,"Public investments in research, development, demonstration, and deployment in energy systems are crucial for accelerating the adoption of new energy technologies that can support a low-carbon just energy transition and promote the fair and equitable distribution of benefits and costs, improving social equity. However, the impact of energy innovation funding on social equity through progressing the just energy transition has not been explored in prior research for advanced economies. Thus, this research quantitively examines how energy innovation funding affects social equity in 23 developed economies for the period of 1995-2020. Employing a fixed effect, augmented mean group, and a system-generalized method of moments technique along with a mediating model, this study finds that increasing energy innovation funding significantly improves social equity directly as well as indirectly via accelerating energy justice in advanced economies. Therefore, proper allocation and utilization of public energy innovation budgets are necessary to promote clean energy technologies, advance the just energy transition, and improve social equity, inclusion, and community engagement. This study emphasizes the importance of policy interventions that promote a just energy transition and energy innovation funding to build resilient and inclusive energy systems that improve social equity while achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7, affordable and clean energy.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy consumption inequality decrease with energy consumption increase: Evidence from rural China at micro scale,"How to achieve no poverty and reduce inequalities are among the core mission of the United Nations sustainable development goals. These goals also play an important role in China's poverty alleviation. In this paper, energy consumption is used as a proxy to measure living standards. Based on the data of 1010 Chinese households in 100 villages, energy consumption status and corresponding inequality at the village level were analyzed. The results showed that the per capita energy consumption of rural areas in China in 2018 was 862.94 kg coal equivalent, among which the main types were biomass and electricity. The regression analysis shows that the latitude and altitude, the distance to county center of the villages, average age, education level, and financial assets of the villagers are the main factors affecting the energy consumption of the villages. With the increase of per capita energy consumption, the Gini coefficient and Theil index both showed a downward trend, meaning energy poverty alleviation and inequality reduction are simultaneously achieved in rural development. The results of this study identify the key factors needed to increase energy consumption and energy efficiency at the village level and provide valuable reference for China's rural energy transformation.",Not About Sufficiency
Energy Colonialism and the Role of the Global in Local Responses to New Energy Infrastructures in the UK: A Critical and Exploratory Empirical Analysis,"Governments, namely in the global North, are fostering the deployment of large-scale low carbon and associated energy infrastructures (EIs), such as power lines, to mitigate climate change. However, when infrastructures are to be deployed, opposition is often found. Environmental justice-involving issues of distributive and procedural justice and recognition-and associated inter-group relations, has been identified as a key aspect for local opposition. However, research has rarely examined local perceptions of environmental justice and associated practices, such as energy colonialism, within a global perspective. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, we examine if and how different-level intergroup relations and collective narratives shape people's social-psychological and geographical imaginaries and responses to EIs.

Energizing the Now: Navigating the Critical Landscape of Today's Energy Challenges-An In-Depth Review,"Today's energy challenges are multifaceted. Over the past 30-40 years, energy issues have been discussed and published on an extensive scale. The green transition involves concrete actions related to increasing energy efficiency, replacing fossil fuels with alternative fuels, producing energy using renewable resources, creating various means of transport that use electric motors, identifying technical solutions that generate an increased energy yield in the case of buildings, and waste reduction, reuse and recycling. In order to attain a climate-neutral environment, it is mandatory to impose regulations, measures and actions to help decarbonize the energy sector. The analysis of published articles on these issues is the subject of this large and information-dense review. Concretely, the transition to climate neutrality will generate obvious advantages at an economic, social and technological level, for example, the opportunity for economic growth, new business models and new markets, and the generation of new jobs or technological development. At the same time, this paper underscores the need for a multifaceted approach, integrating technological innovation, policy intervention and global cooperation for an effective energy transformation.

En route to decarbonization: A periodisation of just transition in four carbon-intensive EU regions,"In 2019, the European Commission launched the Green Deal to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, with the decarbonization of energy sources as one of its pillars. However, decarbonization is proceeding unevenly and is creating significant disruption, especially for regions that are heavily dependent on coal cycle activities. We do not know exactly how, when and why regional actors switch from resisting decarbonization to more adaptive, and transformative decarbonization strategies, and how to provide support for this process. This paper examines how four EU carbon-intensive regions respond to increasing decarbonization pressures, and periodizes the energy transition process in four carbon-intensive European regions. This work employs concepts from two strands of literature: phases of energy transition, and just transitions. For our analysis, we integrated two methods: interviews & focus groups, and national & regional press analysis. We could identify several 'periods ' for each region ' s transition, characterized by different combinations and prevalence of resistance, adaptation, and transformation actions. Our findings suggest that (i) regions that have a clear plan for workers ' transitions with funding attached are at an advantage in progressing to further transition phases; (ii) when transition plans are subject to wide participation, the process appears smoother than with top-down processes; (iii) countries characterized by a less diversified power mix and a higher dependency on a single national resource tend to transition more slowly; (iv) regions that are faring economically better will not automatically be at an advantage in the transition if they have a powerful incumbent fossil industry.",Not About Sufficiency
Empowering Energy Justice,"The U.S. is experiencing unprecedented movement away from coal and, to a lesser degree, oil. Burdened low-income communities and people of color could experience health benefits from reductions in air and water pollution, yet these same groups could suffer harm if transitions lack broad public input or if policies prioritize elite or corporate interests. This paper highlights how U.S. energy transitions build from, and contribute to, environmental injustices. Energy justice requires not only ending disproportionate harm, it also entails involvement in the design of solutions and fair distribution of benefits, such as green jobs and clean air. To what extent does the confluence of state, civic, and market processes assure just transitions to clean, low-carbon energy production involving equitable distribution of costs, benefits, and decision-making power? To explore this question we assess trends with (1) fossil fuel divestment; (2) carbon taxes and social cost of carbon measurements; (3) cap-and-trade; (4) renewable energy; and (5) energy efficiency. Current research demonstrates opportunities and pitfalls in each area with mixed or partial energy justice consequences, leading to our call for greater attention to the specifics of distributive justice, procedural justice, and recognition justice in research, policy, and action. Illustrative energy transition case studies suggest the feasibility and benefit of empowering approaches, but also indicate there can be conflict between green and just, as evident though stark inequities in clean energy initiatives. To identify positive pathways forward, we compile priorities for an energy justice research agenda based on interactive and participatory practices aligning advocacy, activism, and academics.",Not About Sufficiency
Emerging environmental justice issues at the intersection of transportation and electricity systems,"Rapid decarbonization of the transportation system is needed to address global climate change, and electrification of the transportation sector will likely be an important strategy to achieve decarbonization goals. While electrification is an effective approach to reducing carbon emissions, it may result in environmental justice consequences that need to be tackled. We discuss four categories of related issues: air quality and health-related equity; technology access; equitable infrastructure development; and a just global supply chain. In regions where grid decarbonization is well under way, transport-related disparities in air quality and health are expected to decrease with electrification. In contrast, in regions that still rely heavily on coal generation, disparities may increase, putting further strain on low-income communities and people of color. The high upfront cost of electric vehicles and limited access to charging present additional challenges for achieving equity in transportation electrification. Meeting the electricity demand of a fully electric vehicle fleet will require rapid expansion of power generation, transmission, and distribution capacity, and the location and design of this infrastructure will have further impacts on communities where it is sited. Here, we offer a perspective on these emerging environmental justice issues at the intersection of transportation and electricity systems and provide policy recommendations and future research directions for electrified transportation. We suggest there is a need for policies targeting electrification and power sector decarbonization in tandem, assessment of barriers to electric vehicle adoption in different groups, development of strategies for community inclusion in infrastructure development decisions, and creation of frameworks to assess equity tradeoffs along the global supply chain supporting electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies.",Not About Sufficiency
Development of Integrated Coconut Agroindustry from a Circular Economy Perspective: A Literature Review,"Indonesia is one of the world’s largest coconut-producing countries. In 2021, the coconut plantation area in Indonesia reached 3,374,347 hectares, resulting in a total production of 2,853,299 tons. Among the total coconut plantation area, 3,361,145 hectares (99.02%) are dedicated to smallholder plantations, involving 6,003,690 farming households. Therefore, coconuts play a significant and vital role in Indonesia. A circular economy approach prioritizes the effective utilization of resources, minimizing waste, and promoting material recycling to establish sustainable systems. The development of an integrated coconut agroindustry that applies circular economy principles by processing all parts of the coconut fruit to produce value-added products and reduce waste generated from the coconut processing process can create an efficient production cycle and minimize negative environmental impacts.

Climate justice in land use planning: Exploring the potential and challenges of nature-based solutions integration in Nigeria,"Land use management stands at the forefront of addressing the intricate challenges posed by climate change while balancing societal needs and environmental sustainability. In the face of climate disasters, such as flooding, the urgency to reevaluate land management practices becomes paramount. Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) have emerged as a promising approach, leveraging natural resilience to mitigate climate change impacts, and offering additional benefits like biodiversity conservation and community well-being. However, the integration of NbS into urban planning raises critical considerations regarding climate justice. Concerns revolve around the equitable distribution of benefits and burdens, with the risk of NbS disproportionately benefiting affluent communities. Moreover, the framing of NbS as alternatives or complements to technological solutions raises questions about perpetuating environmental injustices and exacerbating social inequalities. Long-term sustainability and management of NbS, coupled with the need for community engagement and participatory decision-making, further complicate the integration process. The Nigerian context exemplifies these challenges, with existing land use policies struggling to accommodate NbS principles amidst fragmentation and ambiguity. The Land Use Act of 1978 falls short in addressing the needs of stakeholders in informal settlements, perpetuating marginalization, and hindering effective climate adaptation efforts. Against this backdrop, this study aims to unravel specific barriers within Nigerian land use policies impeding NbS integration and climate adaptation. Through insights from policymakers, planners, and stakeholders, this research seeks to illuminate pathways for policy reforms fostering inclusive and effective climate adaptation strategies.

According to the model, the article calculates the substitution elasticity of factors in China's energy sectors, non-energy department and consumption preference in domestic energy and non-energy commodities. Based on the social optimal welfare model, the effect on social welfare caused by carbon taxes in different links is further evaluated. The results show that a certain amount of carbon tax in the production link raises the social welfare, while in consumption and redistribution links lowers the social welfare. Specifically, the absolute value of marginal social welfare in the redistribution link is larger. Moreover, the values of the three types of carbon taxes vary under different redistribution demands though the variation trends of tax in the same link are similar. As a result, a small amount of carbon tax on the production link contributes to the growth of social welfare. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Effective mechanism for trading generation rights in the context of carbon emission rights,"In the global context of intensive energy resource consumption and substantial greenhouse gas emissions, as the energy sector with the highest share of carbon emissions, the power generation industry is destined to play a central role in China's efforts to promote energy conservation and emission reduction. With the emergence of local carbon pilot projects and the implementation of a national carbon market, key emission units in the power industry, in addition to the electricity market business, also need to fulfill and pay carbon emission rights on schedule. The power generation rights are a market-based mechanism for clean energy units to replace conventional energy units in electricity generation, which can promote carbon emission reduction by incorporating the actual carbon emissions from conventional energy units. This paper establishes an optimized social welfare model that incorporates the interdependency between the thermal power generation unit market and the electric carbon market. It is based on the social welfare model of power generation rights and the initial allocation of carbon emission rights for the units, while considering the cost increase of excess emission under monthly forecasted power generation by the thermal power units. Taking a certain hydropower province as the simulation object, it was verified that the optimized model has a higher transaction rate of power generation rights, greater social welfare, and no reduction in unit revenue.",Not About Sufficiency
Ecuador's Yasuni-ITT Initiative: Avoiding emissions by keeping petroleum underground,"As large petroleum reserves were confirmed in the Yasuni National Park of Ecuador, one of the most biodiverse hotspots in the Amazonian region and the world, Ecuador has proposed indefinitely keeping almost a billion barrels of petroleum underground, if the international community contributes with at least half of the opportunity cost of exploiting the petroleum. An internationally administrated fund with UN participation will be created and invested exclusively in conservation, renewable energy and social development. The proposal has already received significant support from international institutions, European governments, NGOs and personalities worldwide. Ecuador, a less developed country in South America, remains dependent of petroleum exports, which have not led to economic growth and diversification, did not reduce poverty and inequality, and had strong environmental impacts. Given the limits of petroleum reserves, the Yasuni-ITT initiative opens alternatives towards sustainable development in the country, allowing a transition towards a post-petroleum society, and promoting ways towards human development within the limits of biodiversity conservation. This proposal, which can be replicated by other developing countries with fossil fuel reserves in biodiverse areas, opens new alternatives for post-Kyoto negotiations with binding commitments for several developing countries, and simultaneously addresses global warming, biodiversity loss, and poverty. In addition, it addresses national and international environmental justice. The article summarizes the proposal within the post-Kyoto context, and discusses relevant topics, such as its significance for Ecuador's development performance and future, as well as national and international environmental justice.

Ecosystem services and legal protection of private property. Problem or solution?,"Ecosystem services (ES) delivery in quantity and quality are essential to improve human wellbeing. Nevertheless, often a considerable part of ES provisioning depends on the use of private land (e.g., flood retention, carbon sequestration, water purification). In this context, the operationalization and implementation of ES concept may collide with legal property rights. Therefore, it is essential to find constructive mechanisms to engage and encourage private owners to implement sustainable land uses to reduce the onsite and offsite impacts of their activities. This paper aims to identify if ES delivery can be constrained by legal private land and how it can be tackled. It is undeniable that land-use changes (e.g., urbanization, agriculture intensification, and land abandonment) affect the territory's capacity to deliver ES in quality and quantity. These changes, especially land abandonment, are increasing the tradeoffs among ES (e.g., between carbon sequestration and water yield). Land-use planning should consider these aspects. Therefore, incorporating ES into spatial plans is crucial for stakeholders to understand the impacts of land-use change in the loss of ES value. This information can be transmitted through maps that communicate the message in a simplified way. Private owners can easily perceive the ES relevance that their land can provide if an understandable message is delivered. Although this can be a good solution, conflicts can appear even with the implementation of schemes such as Payment for ES (PES). PES is not always effective and can impose losses to farmers, disregard their cultural traditions, or not prevent poverty alleviation. In this context, it is crucial to consider local specificities to safeguard PES's success, create a ""win-win"" and transform a problem into a solution.

The 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro adopted the idea, without further testing, as its intellectual core. Since 1992, the United Nations, the United States, and many other nations have created agencies to track progress toward sustainable development. In favor of the idea are individuals, including, it appears, most economists, who advocate centralization, internationalization, and rapid economic development. The opposition consists principally of people from academic disciplines, especially ecologists and humanists. This group does not communicate effectively, but if it did, it might agree that: economic development and environmental protection are not compatible; insistence by economists that all natural resources be given a dollar value is useless, if not harmful; biodiversity has intrinsic value; sustainable development weakens local autonomy; and social welfare is a key component of environmental health. To strengthen the defense of ecosystems, ecologists, humanists, and others should apply their knowledge to practical environmental problems. By making their knowledge accessible in local political arenas, they will concurrently shore up the ability of local units to protect their environments and speak with force in larger political arenas. All proponents of environmental health must become advocates of environmental justice.",Not About Sufficiency
"Ecological footprint and human well-being nexus: accounting for broad-based financial development, globalization, and natural resources in the Next-11 countries","The Next-11 (N11) countries have witnessed great advancements in economic activities in the past few years. However, the simultaneous attainment of environmental sustainability and improved human well-being has remained elusive. This study probes into ecological footprint (EF) and human well-being nexus in N11 countries by applying advanced estimation techniques compatible with heterogeneity, endogeneity, and cross-sectional dependence across country groups. From the findings, human well-being, captured by the human development index, increases the EF, and EF also increases human well-being which suggests a strong trade-off between both indicators. This shows that policies that are channeled toward promoting human well-being are not in consonance with environmental wellness. Financial development and biocapacity increase the EF, while natural resources and globalization reduce it. Human well-being increases the EF in all the countries except in Egypt. This study argues that strong institutions could help mitigate the trade-offs and ease the simultaneous attainment of both environmental preservation and improved human well-being. The limitations of the study, as well as, possible directions for future research are discussed.",Not About Sufficiency
Dynamic effects of energy aid in energy transition under the moderating role of the government's regulatory quality,"Energy aid to Asia Pacific countries seems attractive for decarbonization and renewable energy transition. However, no clear picture has been drawn on the synergetic connections between the energy aid and the transition to renewable energy in the Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) paradigm. Therefore, this study is designed to fill this gap by examining the energy aid and its response to energy transition, measuring it with four sub-indicators of SDG7. Using a robust econometric framework, the empirical findings indicated that total energy aid has substantial potential in transitioning to renewable energy, and the link is more pronounced with energy policy aid and renewable energy aid in the Asia Pacific. The response of energy aid through the moderating effect of government regulatory quality on energy transition is also strong. These results carried similar signs and magnitude across the regional panels, estimates with multiple estimators, including asymmetric analysis, making the results robust for theoretical foundations. The novel findings from this study have scope for policymakers to design a practical policy roadmap for the transition of renewable energy to reach a carbon-neutral globe.",Not About Sufficiency

"Impact assessment study for an onshore exploratory well in a biologically diverse lagoon environment, South Trinidad","The Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (Petrotrin) proposed to undertake the drilling of an onshore exploratory well in the vicinity of Debe, South Trinidad. The Immediate Impact Area (IIA), which constitutes the focus of this study has been defined primarily as an area of one kilometer radius from the proposed surface location. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was conducted which includes a descriptive statement of the proposal, description of the existing environment and its uses, legal and regulatory requirements, identification and assessment on potential impacts, and recommendations to mitigate against impacts. Baseline surveys of the physical, biological, agricultural and socio-economic environments were conducted within the Immediate Impact Area and environs. The primary impacting activities identified were site construction and drilling operations. These would impact on the physical, biological, agricultural and socio-economic resources. The environmental issues for this petroleum activity are the effects of effluent discharge, particularly from drilling operations in surface waterways, disturbance of river ecosystem, surface water quality, soil contamination, erosion, dust pollution and increased noise levels. The likely socio-economic impact is short term but positive, in terms of creation of temporary jobs and increased business activity within a socially depressed community. Environmental Management Strategies were recommended to mitigate the anticipated environmental impacts of the project. It is envisaged that resource deterioration, environmental degradation and habitat destruction associated with this petroleum activity will be minimal, if not negligible. Success in this petroleum activity could see benefits to the wider community and the nation as a whole. Copyright 1998, Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",Not About Sufficiency
Poverty and the environment: reversing the downward spiral,"The disparities in living standards that separate the poor from the rich are nearly beyond comprehension. The world has 157 billionaires, and perhaps 2 million millionaires, but 100 million people around the globe are homeless, living on sidewalks, in garbage dumps, and under bridges. For the poor, particularly those living in Africa and Latin America, the 80's have been an unmitigated disaster, a time of falling earnings and rising debt, of falling food supplies and rising death rates. This study discusses the prospect that the poor get poorer; the global poverty trap; poverty and the environment; and ways of reversing the downward spiral. -from Author",Not About Sufficiency
Criteria and indicators for land quality and sustainable land management,"Sustainable land management (SLM) requires the integration of technologies, policies and activities in the rural sector, particularly agriculture, in such a way as to enhance economic performance while maintaining the quality and environmental functions of the natural resource base. Five criteria to evaluate progress towards SLM were identified: productivity, security, protection, viability and acceptability. The definition and pillars are the basic principles and the foundation on which sustainable land management is being developed, and these have been examined and debated by many over the past seven years. Through this process, the concepts of land use resilience and social equity have been added, but otherwise the definition and pillars have stood up to the test. The concept of sustainable land management, like the concept of sustainable development on which it is founded, is gaining momentum in rural as well as in urban constituencies. This is due as much to its psychologic appeal as to the flexibilitiy of the definition. Much progress has been made in identifying criteria and indicators for SLM. To date, international agreement has been achieved on the following land quality indicators: (1) five sets of indicators that can be developed in the short term, ie, nutrient balance, yield trends and variablity, land use intensity, and use diversity and land cover; (2) three sets of indicators, requiring longer-term research, on the themes of soil quality, land degradation and agro-biodiversity; and (3) four sets of indicators that are being developed by other working groups, ie, water quality, forest land quality, rangeland quality and land contamination/pollution. These are the land quality components of SLM and still must be complemented with indicators of the other pillars - economic viability, system resilience, and social equity and acceptability. In these last areas, agreement has been reached only on the indicators: net farm profitability and use of soil conservation practices. Although these are still general themes rather than specific indicators, they provide effective and practical direction on the criteria and requirements for sustainable land management and they channel the research effort. Identifying indicators, however, is only one of several important steps. The next major initiative has to be on procedures to implement SLM at local, national and international levels. Advances in SLM will not be achieved on the basis of technologic and scientific advances alone; changes in institutional and economic structures will also have to be part of the solution. For example, soil conservation technologies and programmes, which were originally designed for rehabilitating degraded areas, must move more into programmes of preventative maintenance; rural land use planning must move away from a prescriptive approach and take on the role of facilitator in order to ensure that the local concerns of farmers and others are given equal hearing with other vested interests. Farmers and other land users are the custodians of rural land resources, and their collective decisions will ultimately determine the sustainability of land use systems.",Not About Sufficiency

Social work and social development: A partnership in social change,"Poverty, both relative and absolute is increasing worldwide. War, natural disasters and environmental degradation have exacerbated economic deprivation, social exclusion and political marginalisation for many of the earth's people. Into this bleak picture comes social development to offer a beacon of hope. What role can social work educators and practitioners play in social development to reverse the pessimism portrayed by this view of reality? This article examines this question by looking at the processes and policies that social workers must bring to the attention of governments - in order to convince them to follow these in the interests of enabling people, whether as individuals, groups or communities to develop to their full potential. The situation in Britain is used as a case example, but the author points out that the changes brought about there through structural adjustment provide lessons to be learnt elsewhere in the world.",Not About Sufficiency
Does the transition to low-carbon energy alleviate urban-rural energy inequality? The case of China,"This paper aims to investigate whether China can reduce urban-rural energy inequality during its transition to low-carbon energy. Using data from 30 Chinese provinces between 2006 and 2019, we employ the system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) to investigate the correlation between low-carbon energy transition (LET) and urban-rural energy inequality. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanism, this study also considers energy service accessibility and industrial structure upgrading. The results of the study show that the degree of LET in China is increasing but with uneven spatial distribution. Moreover, LET is effective in reducing urban-rural energy inequality in China. Specifically, 1 % increase in LET corresponds to 0.045 % reduction in the urban-rural energy inequality index. Additionally, energy service accessibility and industrial structure upgrading are identified as effective channels for LET to mitigate urban-rural energy inequality. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that the alleviating impact of LET on energy inequality is more significant in regions where LET and urban-rural energy inequality levels are high. Drawing on our research results, we suggest policy recommendations to encourage the adoption of low-carbon energy sources and diminish urban-rural energy inequality.",Not About Sufficiency
Does the circular economy transition aid to carbon neutrality? Examining net-zero policy and stakeholder impact from the environmental justice viewpoint,"The circular economy is crucial in promoting environmental justice by reducing the uneven burden of environmental hazards on marginalized communities and low-income individuals. The circular economy transition is increasingly a pivotal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. Recent shifts in stakeholder focus towards carbon neutrality have made net-zero and environmental social and governance (ESG) hot topics to study, as they can lead to environmental justice. This research delves into the significance of net-zero policies and stakeholder pressure in integrating circular economy concepts into supply chains, aiming to establish a carbon-neutral supply chain within the environmental justice framework. Even though there is a lot of literature about the circular economy, not much is known about how it affects the adoption of the circular economy, the involvement of stakeholders, and net zero policy. Specifically, the role of innovation capability in this context has not been fully explored. This research aims to clarify the role of stakeholders in promoting circular economic practices in supply chains and their impact on carbon neutrality. It also examines how net-zero policies and innovation capabilities affect each other. To achieve this, we used structural equation modeling on data from 217 manufacturing firms from October 2023 to January 2024. Findings highlight a positive relationship between stakeholder pressure and circular economy integration, contributing to carbon-neutral supply chain outcomes. Results show net-zero policies moderate the stakeholder and circular economy relationship, with innovative capabilities acting as a partial mediator. This study adds to the literature by explaining the complex relationships between stakeholder pressures, circular economy practices, and the role of net zero policies and innovation capabilities in advancing carbon-neutral supply chains. This research makes a unique contribution to theory by examining the impact of circular economy practices on social well-being and environmental benefits, particularly regarding environmental justice.",Not About Sufficiency
Do sustainable development goals (SDGs) boost green productivity in national marine fisheries? International evidence,"ObjectiveThis study examines the determinants of green total factor productivity in marine fisheries, considering the role of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) in promoting sustainable marine resource utilization and conservation.MethodsThis study employs panel data from 57 countries between 2001 and 2021 to estimate efficiency scores through the directional distance function and the Malmquist-Luenberger model by incorporating inputs (labor, fishing vessels, and energy consumption) and outputs (gross ocean product and carbon dioxide emissions). A truncated regression analysis is conducted to explore the relationship between SDG 14 and green total factor productivity (GTFP) while controlling for financial resources and macroeconomic indicators.ResultThe findings indicate that SDG 14 significantly enhances both constant returns to scale (CRS) technical efficiency and variable returns to scale (VRS) pure technical efficiency, underscoring the importance of marine conservation and sustainable resource management. Additionally, financial resources (like green lending and government investment), research and innovation (like research and development, the number of researchers, and foreign funds), and macroeconomic factors (like the gross ocean product, gross domestic product, and inflation) positively influence green productivity.ConclusionThe results underscore the importance of marine conservation and sustainable practices for enhancing GTFP in fisheries.

Do plans matter? A game-theoretic model for examining the logic and effects of land use planning,"Although state and local growth management programs vary widely, nearly all such programs include one common feature: they require local governments to plan. While there has been extensive research on the effects of growth management in general and on specific policy instruments to manage urban growth there has been little research on the effects of planning. In this paper we present a game-theoretic model of urban development in which a rational local government plans. The model illustrates how planning can serve to guide local government decision making, how land market participants might respond to local government plans, and how planning in a dynamic context can increase social welfare. By considering local government as a player who plans rather than as an external disturbance that might regulate, we can discover insights and frame hypotheses about the efficacy of planning that are not possible in other urban economic models.",Not About Sufficiency
Examining the effect of economic complexity on energy justice,"A clean and healthy environment is necessary to achieve other Sustainable Development Goals. Policymakers must find ways to minimize carbon dioxide emissions and global warming before the Sustainable Development era expires.

This underscores the importance of examining, addressing, and preventing various inequalities in the energy sector. Thus, this paper endeavours to examine probably for the first time the effect of economic complexity on energy justice in a panel of 62 countries over the past decade. The measure of energy justice in this study is a rarely used indicator constructed from a range of 21 sub indicators. We also use three sub-indices of energy justice: distributive justice, procedural justice, and restorative justice. The empirical analyses based on a range of robust estimation approaches consistently provide strong evidence that, on average, economic complexity improves energy justice and its three sub components. Finally, the results from the mediation analysis show that the positive effect of economic complexity on energy justice mediates through income, and human capital. Based on these results, some policy recommendations are made for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 7, 8, and 16.A clean and healthy environment is necessary to achieve other Sustainable Development Goals.

Diversifying the African energy system: Economic versus equitable allocation of renewable electricity and e-fuel production,"Trading of renewable energy in the form of green hydrogen and other renewable e-fuels from regions with abundant solar and wind resources is expected to play a key role in enabling the global net-zero transition. While the literature has almost exclusively focused on energy systems implications in the Global North, the types and distribution of economic benefits of trading renewable energy in the Global South are not well understood. Here, we develop a multi-objective linear program to derive least cost pathways of gradually diversifying renewable e-fuel trade, such as hydrogen and methanol, and apply it to the case of e-fuel trade between Africa and Europe. Using a country-level Gini-coefficient approach to model the equality of per capita economic value adds, the model yields Pareto-optimal system configurations that distribute the economic benefits of decarbonization more equally in different African countries, and at the same time, diversify the source of such fuels for more robust global renewable energy trade. We find that the cost-optimal configuration concentrates e-fuel production in only a few African countries. But reducing the unequal distribution of economic value add by half increases system cost by less than 10%, and is possible at low production costs (less than 1 USD/kg for renewable methanol and less than 4 USD/kg for renewable hydrogen). Our results thus point towards cost-efficient pathways for decision makers to increase African and European renewable energy security by distributing its production across more African countries.",Not About Sufficiency
Diverse Pathways for Power Sector Decarbonization in Texas Yield Health Cobenefits but Fail to Alleviate Air Pollution Exposure Inequities,"Decarbonizing power systems is a critical component of climate change mitigation, which can have public health cobenefits by reducing air pollution. Many studies have examined strategies to decarbonize power grids and quantified their health cobenefits. However, few of them focus on near-term cobenefits at community levels, while comparing various decarbonization pathways. Here, we use a coupled power system and air quality modeling framework to quantify the costs and benefits of decarbonizing the Texas power grid through a carbon tax; replacing coal with natural gas, solar, or wind; and internalizing human health impacts into operations. Our results show that all decarbonization pathways can result in major reductions in CO(2 )emissions and public health impacts from power sector emissions, leading to large net benefits when considering the costs to implement these strategies. Operational changes with existing infrastructure can serve as a transitional strategy during the process of replacing coal with renewable energy, which offers the largest benefits. However, we also find that Black and lower-income populations receive disproportionately higher air pollution damages and that none of the examined decarbonization strategies mitigate this disparity. These findings suggest that additional interventions are necessary to mitigate environmental inequity while decarbonizing power grids.",Not About Sufficiency
Differentiated Carbon Prices and the Economic Cost of Decarbonization,"Employing a numerical general equilibrium model with multiple fuels, end-use sectors, heterogeneous households, and transport externalities, this paper examines three motives for differentiated carbon pricing in the context of Swiss climate policy: fiscal interactions with the existing tax code, non- related transport externalities, and social equity concerns. Interaction effects with mineral oil taxes reduce carbon taxes on motor fuels and transport externalities increase them. We show that the cost-effective overall carbon tax on motor fuels should be lower than the one on thermal fuels. This is found in spite of the fact that pre-existing taxes on motor fuels are well below our estimate of the transport externality per unit of transport fuel consumption. Differentiating taxes in favor of motor fuels yields only slightly more equitable incidence effects among households, suggesting that equity considerations play a minor role when designing differentiated carbon pricing policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Decarbonization technology responsibility to gender equality in the shipping industry: a systematic literature review and new avenues ahead,"This study investigates existing literature on decarbonization technology responsibility for sustainable business models in the shipping industry. Specifically, it considers the relationship between responsible innovation from green technology adoption in decarbonization management practices and gender equality to precisely target how decarbonization technology relates to gender mainstreaming, a key element of Sustainable Development Goal 5 in the UN 2030 Agenda. From the institutional theory perspective, this study conducted a systematic review of 114 articles published in the ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases from 1990 to 2022. The results highlight that green technology adoption can support low-carbon practices and gender equality in the shipping industry by contributing to decarbonization technology responsibility, sustainable business models, and responsible innovation. Ultimately, this study suggests that shipping management should provide training and workshops for women on technology adoption in decarbonization operational processes to support gender quality and technological development. It also presents a new conceptual framework and research propositions on significant issues that are currently neglected. The proposed framework may be treated as a decarbonization technology responsibility guideline in shipping management that can reshape the organizational culture to promote gender equality.",Not About Sufficiency
"Evaluating the impacts of anticipated sea level rise, climate change and land use land cover scenarios on the rice crop in Alappuzha, Kerala and strategies to build climate responsive agriculture","PurposeThis paper aims to inform the readers an overview of expected impacts of sea level rise (SLR) and climate change on rice crops area, yield and the urgent need to build climate responsive infrastructures to a coastal district, Alappuzha – a high-risk area which is already under mean sea level (MSL). This research carried out to understand the realities and impacts with respect to the exposures of rise in SLR and possible inundation extent of crop land. The extreme precipitation events have caused crop loss and damage, numerous casualties and enormous economic loss in this district during the recent past and project the likely impacts under anticipated climate change.Design/methodology/approachGlobal sea levels have already been risen noticeably as a result of climate change, and this trend is anticipated to continue. To reflect on the research objectives, the paper projects a climate change scenario analysis and impact assessment on the major crop grown, i.e. rice, using a crop simulation model, DSSAT 4.7 as the first part of the study. QGIS 3.28 version and Erdas Imagine software were used for land use land cover analysis and to delineate possible inundation in the major land use land cover, especially in agriculture area under SLR scenario. It points out the need to equip the district urgently with climate responsive agriculture strategies as majority of the area comes under 10 mts of elevation as per the Sentinel 2 data. For better adapting to the current and future climate change impacts in the aspects of built environment such as early warnings in farm sector in particular and forests, urban water management, transportation systems, building construction and operation and land use planning in general. Climate change is no longer a policy issue alone; now it is a common man’s nightmare. For a coastal state like Kerala, extreme climate events during 2018 and 2019 and 2021 have posed substantial impacts and damages on the environment and society. The impacts hit the vulnerable communities in multiple ways.FindingsFrom the analysis, it was revealed that there is an increasing trend in rainfall observed over the past three decades in Alappuzha district. It is projected that day and night time temperatures may increase in Alappuzha by 2.5°C and 2.6°C by 2100, respectively, under RCP 4.5. With unchecked pollution or emission reduction actions, warming may further rise and hence the median projection when SLR reaches 2.4 meters (8 ft) at Alappuzha to Cochin coast is 2130s. The possible inundation analysis shows that around 53.48% of the coastal agriculture land may be likely inundated if SLR is only with mitigation measures such as extreme carbon cuts, SLR rise can be delayed till 2200. Alappuzha is known as the rice bowl of Kerala; however, it is highly exposed to climate vulnerability in terms of its unique environmental geographical settings like coastal wetlands, lagoons and sand beaches. DSSAT simulations shows that Uma rice, a major ruling variety in the region, may have yield reductions of up to 13% in the near century for Alappuzha.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper in general explains the projected climate change perspectives for Alappuzha, a climate change hotspot of Kerala with respect to SLR and coastal agriculture. and a review of the progression of DRR in the built environment and mainstreaming CCA and DRR by government and other agencies in the state.Practical implicationsThis study underscores the urgent need for climate-responsive agricultural strategies in Alappuzha, Kerala, due to anticipated sea level rise, climate change, and land use changes. Equipping farmers with the knowledge and tools to adapt is essential for ensuring food security and sustainable livelihoods. Implementing climate-resilient practices and technologies will help mitigate adverse effects on rice crops, promoting economic stability and resilience in the region. Involving local stakeholders in the adaptation process is crucial, as their participation can enhance collaboration, increase awareness, and accelerate the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, making the transition smoother and more effective.Social implicationsIt is the responsibility of the scientific community to inform the knowledge gained for the benefit of the society, especially on criticality of altering the existing land use pattern and building climate resilient coastal infrastructures. Studies such as this can stand as basis for implementing planned adaption actions. This is to conclude that instead of working in silos, mainstreaming climate change adaptation holistically across sectors is very necessary at this crucial hour. Participatory action plans and policies involving all local stakeholders can strengthen awareness and fasten the learning processes for adaptation including managed retreats.Originality/valueAt present, there are no specific studies, on the impacts of climate change and SLR on rice cropping systems in the district which specifically inform how to mainstream adaptation in the agriculture strategies in low lying coastal zones of Alappuzha.",Not About Sufficiency

Developmental States and Sustainability Transitions: Prospects of a Just Transition in South Africa,"Since the onset of the global economic crisis in 2007/2008 two key trends have made it necessary to reconceptualize the relationship between development and sustainability: the rapid rise of the so-called BRICS' and the emergence of the green economy discourse and now since 2015 the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals. To address this challenge with respect to developing economies in the global South, this paper endeavours to fuse the core conceptual concerns of the developmental state and sustainability transition literatures. It is argued that a just transition would consist of a dual commitment to human well-being (with respect to income, education and health) and sustainability (with respect to decarbonization, resource efficiency and ecosystem restoration). However, to understand these processes we need a better understanding of political dynamics, and for this purpose the notion of a socio-political regime is introduced. A case study of South Africa's dual developmental and environmental trajectories is presented, revealing how different it is to the East Asian experience. Although a just transition in South Africa is currently unlikely, the rapid emergence of the renewable energy niche signals what may be possible if political and environmental shocks are experienced by key actors within the socio-political regime.",Not About Sufficiency
"Development of site suitability framework for urban greenspace: a case study of Sikar city, Rajasthan, India","Greenspaces are crucial in enhancing the standard of living, environmental sustainability, and overall well-being of urban populations. It serves the goal of providing thermal comfort, restoring the environment’s ecological balance, and climatic modification within the urban fabric. However, allocating and distributing these valuable resources often involve complex environmental, social, economic, and spatial considerations. Factors like built-up density, land use, land cover, slope, and distance from roads, greenspaces and water bodies have been adopted as the criterion for the site suitability of green space. This paper proposes a structured approach using these factors that integrates quantitative analyses and advanced spatial modelling to guide informed decisions, foster inclusivity, and optimize the benefits of greenspace provisioning and distribution. The study employed a geographic information system (GIS) based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach to determine the optimal locations for allocating greenspaces within urban planning. The study deeply analyzed the existing land use of Sikar city and found 47.23 ha of land parcels suitable for allocating greenspace based on the six factors mentioned above. The analysis reveals that, among the 49.23 hectares of suitable areas, 48% of the land parcels are less than 0.5 hectares in size. These parcels are predominantly unplanned and situated away from the city centre. There’s also a lack of the possibility of large green spaces in the city’s central area due to the non-availiability of vacant land. By synthesizing empirical data, case studies, and existing literature, this research paper outlines a robust methodology to support urban planners, policymakers, and stakeholders in making informed choices that promote sustainable urban development and a higher quality of life.",Not About Sufficiency
Determining the effectiveness of the forest load capacity factor in assisting decarbonization in India,"The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased dramatically due to various human activities, with deforestation playing an important role. Forests act as carbon sinks and have the capacity to absorb CO2 and other harmful emissions from the atmosphere. In particular, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)15 (Life on Land) addresses the importance of reforestation and forest management. Accordingly, this study analyzes the impact of the forest load capacity factor and renewable energy on CO2 emissions in the context of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. For this purpose, the study focuses on India from 1990 to 2021. The empirical results indicate that (i) the EKC hypothesis is valid; (ii) the forest load capacity factor has an inhibitory effect on CO2 emissions; and (iii) renewable energy consumption has no significant effect on ecological degradation. This study points to the crucial role of forest load capacity for ecological sustainability. Moreover, renewable energy sources do not seem to be a viable option to achieve India's environmental goals. Therefore, the Indian government should focus on improving afforestation and forest conservation policies to improve ecological conditions.",Not About Sufficiency
Designing without nature: Unsewered residential development in rural Wisconsin,"In the classic environmental planning book, Design with Nature, McHarg (1969) demonstrated a land use planning process that employed multiple layers of geocoded data. Computerized geographic information systems (GIS) have subsequently enhanced land use planners' abilities to identify the opportunities and constraints posed by a landscape's biophysical systems. Nevertheless, improvements in transportation infrastructure, combined with an assortment of technological advances, have greatly diminished the constraining effects of distance and physiography on land use spatial patterns. In the United States, for example, advances in wastewater management technology have decreased the influence of soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and depth to water table on residential development locational decisions. The evolution of this technology has helped facilitate scattered, low-density residential development in rural landscapes across the nation.

Energy Transition and Poverty Alleviation in Light of Environmental and Economic Challenges: A Comparative Study in China and the European Union Region,"This study aims to compare the effectiveness of renewable energy and circular economy practices in reducing environmental damage and poverty in China and the European Union (EU) by using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach and the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) technique. Analyzing data from 1995 to 2022, we compared the effectiveness of these approaches in both regions. This study offers several fresh perspectives on the fight against environmental damage and poverty, differentiating itself from existing research in a few key ways. In fact, most studies focus on a single region’s approach to sustainability. However, this research directly compares China and the European Union (EU), highlighting how factors like economic structure and development stages influence the effectiveness of renewable energy and circular economy practices. Also, this study shows how renewable energy and circular practices can simultaneously tackle both environmental damage (emissions) and social issues (poverty). Our findings reveal that factors like poverty, fossil fuel reliance, economic growth, and international trade all contribute to rising carbon emissions in both China and the EU, though their influence varies. Interestingly, China experienced greater success in curbing emissions through solar power, circular economy measures, and wind power compared to the EU. Additionally, the impact of these strategies on poverty reduction differed significantly between the two regions. Based on these results, we recommend that policy makers in both regions develop tailored strategies for tackling carbon emissions and poverty. Prioritizing renewable energy sources and circular practices is key, as they can simultaneously reduce emissions and alleviate poverty. However, it is crucial to focus on approaches that work best in each specific region, considering social, economic, and environmental factors. This study suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work for fighting climate change and poverty. While renewable energy and circular economies are effective, China saw greater success with solar and wind power compared to the EU. Policy makers need to design strategies specific to their region’s economic, social, and environmental context. Further research can refine these approaches, and public education is crucial to promote sustainable behavior and empower policy makers. It is also needed to refine and improve the implementation of these strategies. Finally, public awareness and education are essential to promote sustainable behavior and empower policy makers in their fight against climate change and poverty. This study highlights the importance of a region-specific approach to energy transition and poverty alleviation.

Allocating constrained global carbon budgets: Inter-regional and inter-generational equity for a sustainable world,"The feasibility of an effective international response to anticipated climate change is dependent on the recognition of the present and historical inequities between developing and industrialized countries. Developing countries should be enabled and supported to continue their development towards higher standards of living in a fashion that is consistent with the sustainability of the global biosphere. This paper evaluates long-term climate strategies by which the burden of mitigating climate change by controlling CO2 emissions is shared equitably. Here we use as a possible criterion of equity, that every human being, past or future, is allowed to emit the same carbon quotum on an annual basis, which, as a theoretical concept, could provide for intergenerational and international equity throughout the world. In order to do this we first define the global carbon budget as the cumulated CO2 emissions over the period 1800 till 2100, from 1990 described by an emission scenario. This budget determines the permitted CO2 emissions per capita using past and future population estimates. Next, we introduce the concept of `emission debt', defined by the difference between the cumulated allowed CO2 emissions, based on the permitted emission quota per capita, and the actual historical CO2 emissions. Finally the remaining carbon budget, described as the global carbon budget (1800-2100) minus the actual cumulated CO2 emissions (1800-1990) is allocated to the different world regions, taking into account the regional past CO2 emissions. This gives the future emission quota per capita. The results show that past industrialization has coincided with a large relative contribution of the rich regions to the rise in CO2 concentration, an estimated 40 per cent for the European Community and North America, which have built up an emission debt of 36 GtC and 75 GtC, respectively, using recent World Bank projections of population growth. The developing countries, however, have built up an emission credit of 24 GtC. These regional emission debts and credits increase the future per capita budget for the developing regions till 0.2-0.8 ton C/cap yearly, whereas North America and the EC end up with a negative future carbon budget of 0.4 to 1.5 ton C/cap yearly. Even if the IPCC Business-as-Usual scenario is considered as reference, the future emission quota of most industrialized countries are lower than their present per capita emissions, i.e. North America has a negative future carbon budget of 0.3 tC/cap yearly.",Not About Sufficiency
"Democratising planetary boundaries: experts, social values and deliberative risk evaluation in Earthsystem governance","Recent debates about the concept of planetary boundaries recall longstanding concerns about whether ecological limits are compatible with ecological democracy. The planetary boundaries framework (originally set out in Rockstrom et al., 2009a, 2009b) defines values for key Earth-system processes such as climate change and biodiversity that aim to maintain a 'safe' distance from thresholds or levels that could endanger human wellbeing. Despite having a significant impact in policy debates, the framework has been criticised as implying an expert-driven approach to governing global environmental risks that lacks democratic legitimacy. Drawing on research on deliberative democracy and the role of science in democratic societies, we argue that planetary boundaries can be interpreted in ways that remain consistent with democratic decision-making. We show how an iterative, dialogical process to formulate planetary boundaries and negotiate 'planetary targets' could form the basis for a democratically legitimate division of labour among experts, citizens and policy-makers in evaluating and responding to Earth-system risks. Crucial to this division of evaluative labour is opening up space for deliberative contestation about the value judgments inherent in collective responses to Earth-system risks, while also safeguarding the ability of experts to issue warnings about what they consider to be unacceptable risks.",Not About Sufficiency
Spatial Optimisation of Renewable Energy Deployment in Great Britain: A Natural Capital Analysis,"Transitioning global energy systems towards low carbon energy sources will be essential if countries are to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to less than 2°C degrees. As countries decarbonise their energy systems, the need to determine the best locations for renewable energy infrastructure whilst balancing trade-offs between affordability, food security, and nature protection is of paramount importance. By incorporating the natural capital approach into energy modelling, this thesis presents the ADVENT-NEV model, a spatially-explicit cost minimisation model which determines the optimal locations for solar farms, onshore wind farms, bioenergy power stations and their bioenergy crops in Great Britain (GB) considering both market and non-market costs (i.e. ecosystem services).This thesis makes several empirical contributions to the energy modelling literature. It highlights that when non-market costs are excluded from decision-making, the welfare loss associated with energy transitions could be up to £5 billion. By applying the natural capital approach, however, the ADVENT-NEV model is able to determine locations for energy infrastructure which minimise the social cost of the energy system. For example, it identifies locations where bioenergy crops could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon sequestration. It concludes however that the expansion of bioenergy crops has the potential to result in a net emission of greenhouse gases; this is concerning given the emphasis being placed on bioenergy to provide carbon sequestration services in GB. This thesis also identifies how restricting bioenergy crops from being grown on National Parks, AONB, peatland and high-grade agricultural land results in even low bioenergy targets being infeasible due to the lack of suitable land.This thesis has demonstrated the critical role that the natural capital approach and high spatial resolution data could play in future energy decision-making. Failure to incorporate spatial environmental data into energy modelling risks overlooking the economic, spatial and social implications of transitioning to a low carbon energy system.",Not About Sufficiency
LCA approach for environmental impact assessment within the maritime industry: Re-design case study of yacht’s superstructure,"Sustainable development, one of the main challenges of our time, is a policy focused on the perfect balance between three fundamental pillars: environmental, economic and social sustainability. As regards the environmental protection, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology allows to evaluate the sustainability profile of the overall Life-Cycle (LC) of products, processes and services, based on an inventory (in terms of materials/energy consumption and emissions/waste production) referred to all LC stages. The paper describes an application of LCA in the maritime transportation field, after a careful analysis of the state of the art. In particular, the case study consists in the environmental comparison of two alternative design solutions for the superstructure of a Azimut-Benetti yacht, designed by Corporate R&D department and manufactured in one of Benetti botyards. The competing construction options are a Glass Fiber reinforced Vinylester-isophthalic Resin (GFVR) and a Carbon Fiber reinforced Epoxy Resin (CFER) component, and they are assessed in terms of Global Warming Potential through the CML2001 Life Cyle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method. The study takes into account the entire LC of the superstructure component, divided into production (including raw materials, manufacturing and transportations), use (including both fuel consumption and exhaust air emissions) and End-of-Life (EoL). The Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is mainly based on primary data (materials and energy consumption for manufacturing) directly provided by the construction company; missing data are retrieved from secondary sources (literature and LCI database provided by the GaBi6 environmental software). Results show that, despite the higher impact in production stage, the innovative solution allows achieving a significant quota of GWP over the entire LC (more than 16%), which is mainly associated with decreased amount of fuel needed and lowered CO2 exhaust emissions during operation. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the environmental advantage provided by the CFER design becomes bigger as both component life-time and yacht consumption increase.",Not About Sufficiency
Decarbonizing the US Energy System,"Recent rapid and unexpected cost reductions in decarbonization technologies have accelerated the cost-effective decarbonization of the US economy, with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions falling by 20% from 2005 to 2020.

While these studies provide a valuable foundation, further research is needed to properly support decarbonization policy development and implementation. In this review, we identify key decarbonization analysis gaps and opportunities, including issues related to cross-sectoral linkages, spatial and temporal granularity, consumer behavior, emerging technologies, equity and environmental justice, and political economy. We conclude by discussing the implications of these analysis gaps for US decarbonization pathways and how they relate to challenges facing major global emitters.",Not About Sufficiency
Decarbonizing the Galapagos Islands: Techno-Economic Perspectives for the Hybrid Renewable Mini-Grid Baltra-Santa Cruz,"The fragile ecosystem of the Galapagos Islands is being affected by population growth, intensive tourism, the exploitation of local resources and the high consumption of imported fossil fuels. This unsustainable development model makes the provision of services such as electricity a challenge. This research investigates the hybrid renewable mini-grid Baltra-Santa Cruz, which represents 62% of the electricity generation mix of the archipelago. This study aims to support the Galapagos Zero Fossil Fuel Initiative and the Sustainable Development Goal 7 through the reduction in diesel consumption and electricity generation costs. To do so, HOMER Pro, a specialized hybrid renewable mini-grid planning tool, is used to perform several techno-economic assessments, focusing on different electricity demand scenarios. Therefore, multiple pathways are compared to identify the most reliable alternatives towards the progressive decarbonization of this hybrid system. The results indicate that installing 18.25 MWp of photovoltaic and 20.68 MWh of battery capacity could reduce the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) from 32.06 to 18.95 USc/kWh, increasing the renewable energy (RE) share from 18% to 39%. Additionally, the successful application of energy efficiency measures would even reduce the LCOE to 17.10 USc/kWh. What is more, distributed energy is considered the most attractive way to involve islanders in the energy transition process. Finally, this paper offers a comprehensive business model proposal to achieve a resilient energy supply, based on a combination of auctions and energy community models, which demands high political will, reliable and innovative regulations and social awareness about energy use.",Not About Sufficiency

Decarbonization will lead to more equitable air quality in California,"Air quality associated public health co-benefit may emerge from climate and energy policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the distribution of these co-benefits has not been carefully studied, despite the opportunity to tailor mitigation efforts so they achieve maximum benefits within socially and economically disadvantaged communities (DACs). Here, we quantify such health co-benefits from different long-term, low-carbon scenarios in California and their distribution in the context of social vulnerability. The magnitude and distribution of health benefits, including within impacted communities, is found to varies among scenarios which reduce economy wide GHG emissions by 80% in 2050 depending on the technology- and fuel-switching decisions in individual end-use sectors. The building electrification focused decarbonization strategy achieves similar to 15% greater total health benefits than the truck electrification focused strategy which uses renewable fuels to meet building demands. Conversely, the enhanced electrification of the truck sector is shown to benefit DACs more effectively. Such tradeoffs highlight the importance of considering environmental justice implications in the development of climate mitigation planning.",Not About Sufficiency
Decarbonization pathways for the residential sector in the United States,"Residential GHG emissions in the United States are driven in part by a housing stock where onsite fossil combustion is common, home sizes are large by international standards, energy efficiency potential is large and electricity generation in many regions is GHG intensive. In this analysis, we assess decarbonization pathways for the US residential sector to 2060, through 108 scenarios describing housing stock evolution, new housing characteristics, renovation levels and clean electricity. The lowest emission pathways involve very rapid decarbonization of electricity supply alongside extensive renovations to existing homes, including improving thermal envelopes and heat pump electrification of heating. Reducing the size and increasing the electrification of new homes provide further emission cuts and combining all strategies enables reductions of 91% between 2020 and 2050. The potential of individual mitigation strategies shows great regional variation. Reaching zero emissions will require simultaneous deployment of multiple strategies and greater reduction of embodied emissions. Residential sector decarbonization is an essential part of mitigation, especially in the United States where per capita energy use is high by global standards.

Decarbonization and social justice: The case for artisanal and small-scale mining,"Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is the primary livelihood for an estimated 40 million people in 80 countries and supports an additional 130 to 270 million people in mining communities. With the emergence of critical minerals necessary for decarbonization efforts, ASM has emerged as a crucial form of production to help meet global demand. Despite its importance, ASM miners and communities are routinely ostracized and pathologized. Rather than the cause of social deprivation, this article argues that ASM reflects broader social, political, and historical inequalities. We contend with four main arguments against ASM before elaborating on three reasons that ASM ought to be responsibly supported. These reasons are ASM's ability to enable economic redistribution, meet increased global demand for critical minerals, and advance social justice. Inclusive regulation and governance rather than exclusion and plausible deniability constitute the pathway to addressing attendant social and environmental challenges associated with ASM practices. This paper identifies pathways to inclusive regulation of ASM and proposes avenues for future research and interventions. Ultimately, ASM must be understood as a central social justice issue of our time, especially in the context of global decarbonization efforts.",Not About Sufficiency

Bibliometric analysis and review of food waste management via sustainable approaches,"The escalating global food waste crisis presents both a challenge and an opportunity for sustainable development. Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted, contributing to environmental degradation and resource inefficiency. This wasted food not only represents a loss of valuable resources but also contributes to significant greenhouse gas emissions when disposed of in landfills. In response to this pressing issue, food waste valorization biorefineries have emerged as a promising solution, transforming waste into valuable bioproducts through innovative biotechnological processes. This review critically examines recent trends in food waste biorefining, focusing on the latest advancements in microbial and enzymatic conversion technologies. Various valorization pathways that convert food waste into biofuels, biochemicals, and bio-based materials are explored, thereby integrating principles of the circular economy to minimize waste and maximize resource utilization. Key developments in the field include the optimization of microbial consortia for enhanced degradation and conversion efficiency, as well as the engineering of enzymes to improve specificity and activity. These advancements have led to significant improvements in the efficiency and feasibility of converting food waste into high-value products. The environmental benefits of these biorefineries are also discussed in depth, encompassing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, decreased reliance on fossil fuels, and the mitigation of environmental pollution. By diverting food waste from landfills and transforming it into renewable resources, these biorefineries play a crucial role in promoting environmental sustainability. Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. Feedstock variability affects process consistency, leading to fluctuations in product yield and quality. There is a need for process optimization to improve yield and cost-effectiveness, ensuring that biorefinery operations are economically viable at an industrial scale. Issues related to scalability and industrial implementation, such as the development of infrastructure and supply chains, also pose significant hurdles. By synthesizing current research, this review underscores the considerable potential of food waste biorefineries to contribute to sustainable agriculture and biocatalysis. Critical gaps in knowledge are identified, and areas for future research are proposed, such as developing robust and flexible biorefining systems capable of handling diverse feedstocks and integrating advanced biotechnological tools for process monitoring and control. The review also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and public-private partnerships in driving innovation and commercialization in this field. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of food waste biorefining and to offer a roadmap for future research and industrial implementation. By highlighting the role of these biorefineries in achieving sustainable development goals, the review emphasizes the need for continued research, technological innovation, and supportive policy frameworks. Through these efforts, food waste valorization biorefineries can play a pivotal role in creating a sustainable and resilient future, addressing both environmental and economic challenges posed by food waste.",Not About Sufficiency

Cross-National Social and Environmental Influences on Life Satisfaction,"Scholars and policymakers are increasingly interested in subjective well-being as a development indicator. However, sociological research on this topic is quite limited, as is research that considers the effects of the biophysical environment on subjective well-being. In this study, we address these gaps in the literature by examining social and environmental influences on life satisfaction, a core component of subjective well-being. We employed multi-level regression analysis using data from over 97,000 individuals living across ninety-six countries. The results demonstrated significant effects of several individual-level variables on life satisfaction, in particular respondents' satisfaction with their local air and water quality and the efforts being made to preserve the environment in their country, as well as numerous social variables, such as income, gender, and employment status. Among the country-level variables, national gross domestic product per capita was positively associated with higher individual life satisfaction. Income inequality had a negative effect on life satisfaction, while wealth inequality, on the other hand, had a positive effect, a surprising finding we contemplate in some detail. The carbon intensity of a nation's economy as well as the proportion of a nation's land in protected areas only influenced life satisfaction when not controlling for the other variables. We conclude by discussing the implications of this research for sustainable development, including the promise of life satisfaction and other measures of subjective well-being as sustainable development indicators.",Not About Sufficiency
Net-Zero Directives and Drivers,"According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), elevated GHG emissions contribute to global warming, air pollution, ocean acidification, increased incidence of forest fires, sea level rise, drought, and other natural catastrophes that harm public health, social equity, and the environment.Elevated levels of GHGs including carbon dioxide and methane are caused by human activities, such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and types of agriculture using fertilizer and raising livestock.Net zero is typically calculated based on the full life-cycle analysis of an activity or product, taking into account all emissions from the transportation, materials, and land use required for the activity or product, and then subtracting any documented reductions in those emissions and taking into account any amount of captured carbon credits purchased.According to the FAA, ""[t]he U.S. supported the decision to adopt the CORSIA [standards] based on the understanding that CORSIA is the exclusive market-based measure applying to international aviation, and that CORSIA will ensure fair and reciprocal commercial competition by avoiding a patchwork of the country- or regionally-based regulatory measures that are inconsistently applied, bureaucratically costly, and economically damaging.""",Not About Sufficiency

The augmented mean group estimator results suggest that ICT, education, and REC reduce the EF, whereas FDI contributes significantly to environmental degradation. On the flip side, ICT reduces CO2 emissions and EF in both the medium and upper quantiles. It suggests that ICT penetration heals the environment and that a higher level of ICT consumption could be a panacea for sustainable development in emerging economies. The causality results show evidence of a feedback causality between economic growth, REC, and CO2 emissions. However, a unidirectional causality flows from economic growth and FDI to EF.

Cooperating for circularity? Perspectives of citizen energy cooperative members on circular solar business models,"Solar photovoltaics (PV) play a critical role in advancing the sustainable energy transition, but growing concerns about PV waste highlight the need for circular economy solutions within the solar value chain.

In many European countries, citizen energy cooperatives have successfully promoted renewable energy adoption in a democratically controlled and participatory way. However, evidence on the role of cooperatives in a circular economy remains limited. In this paper, we use survey data from Flanders (Belgium), to investigate perspectives of citizen energy cooperative members and non-members on circular solar business models. Our findings reveal that cooperative members exhibit greater interest and trust in solar Product-Service Systems models and PV reuse, driven not only by financial considerations but also by environmental consciousness and cooperative values.

"Contribution of the carbon tax, phase-out of thermoelectric power plants, and renewable energy subsidies for the decarbonization of Chile - A CGE model and microsimulations approach","There are various climate policies to decarbonize the energy matrix of a country. In the case of Chile, a carbon tax of 5 USD/tCO(2) was initially implemented, and later, a schedule was established for the phase-out of coal-fired thermoelectric plants, all the above in the absence of subsidies for non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE). This study uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and microsimulations to assess the contribution of current climate policies and other more demanding scenarios that accelerate the decarbonization of the Chilean energy matrix, considering economic, environmental, and distributional impacts. Specifically, carbon taxes are simulated with and without complementary climate policies (phase-out of coal-fired power plants and NCRE subsidies). The results show that the scenarios that combine the three climate policies generate a greater decrease in greenhouse gas emissions (40.4% similar to 57.5%). Besides, the drop in GDP is more pronounced when coal-fired thermoelectric plants phase out (0.3% additional), and NCRE subsidies contribute to moderately reducing emissions. However, NCRE subsidies reduce the negative effect on households' expenditure and income, especially in the poorest quintile. Finally, microsimulations show marginal changes in income distribution and an increase of up to 0.4 percentage points in the poverty rate.",Not About Sufficiency

Our findings indicate that the circular economy is most frequently depicted as a combination of reduce, reuse and recycle activities, whereas it is oftentimes not highlighted that CE necessitates a systemic shift. We further find that the definitions show few explicit linkages of the circular economy concept to sustainable development. The main aim of the circular economy is considered to be economic prosperity, followed by environmental quality; its impact on social equity and future generations is barely mentioned. Furthermore, neither business models nor consumers are frequently outlined as enablers of the circular economy. We critically discuss the various circular economy conceptualizations throughout this paper. Overall, we hope to contribute via this study towards the coherence of the circular economy concept; we presume that significantly varying circular economy definitions may eventually result in the collapse of the concept.",Not About Sufficiency
Comprehensive evaluation on sustainable development based on planetary pressures and ecological well-being performance: A case study on the belt and road regions,"The ultimate goal of sustainable development is to expand human developmental potential while easing plan-etary pressures, maximize human well-being with the smallest ecological consumption. However, it is difficult to rely on a single index or a single measure to address all sustainable development issues, which needs to comprehensively evaluate its abilities and levels from 'sustainability' and 'development'. Thus we construct a comprehensive evaluation method, the consumption-pressure-output-efficiency method (the first two reflect 'sustainability' and the latter two 'development'). It combines four progressive composite indices respectively reflecting (1) ecological consumption (ecological footprint), (2) planetary pressures (from carbon dioxide emissions and the material footprint index), (3) human well-being outputs (the planetary pressures-adjusted human development index, or PHDI), and (4) ecological well-being output efficiency (an adjusted ecological well-being performance index, or AEWP). Our empirical verification results show that the same ecological consumption will show different ecological surplus/deficit and development potential due to different bio-capacity; the higher the level of human development, the greater the planetary pressure; the human development index (HDI) adjusted by planetary pressure are generally decreased, and the greater the HDI, the greater the dispersion between PHDI and HDI; and there is no necessarily complete consistency between PHDI and AEWP. The Belt and Road regions overall show a greater capacity for, and improvement in sustainable development than the world from 1990 to 2017, due to lower ecological consumption, slower decrease in biocapacity, faster in-crease in PHDI, and higher AEWP.

Comparison of Incentive Policies for Renewable Energy in an Oligopolistic Market with Price-Responsive Demand,"This article compares different incentive policies to encourage the development of renewable energy (RE). These incentive policies (carbon tax, feed-in tariff, premium payment and quota system) are modeled in a simplified radial power network, using price-responsive demand. Most results are derived assuming an oligopolistic Cournot competitive framework and that the costs of subsidies are covered by the government (i.e., customers do not directly pay back for the subsidies). We compare the different RE incentive schemes at different congestion levels in terms of energy prices, RE generation, CO2 emissions, and social welfare. We find that the effectiveness of the different incentive schemes varies significantly depending on the market structure assumed, the costs of renewable energy, and the subsidy recovery method considered. Subsidy policies (FIT and premium payments) are more cost effective in reducing CO2 emissions than those policies that apply penalties or taxes, when assuming oligopoly competition and that customers do not directly pay back for the subsidies. Quota and carbon tax policies are more cost effective when assuming that either a perfectly competitive electricity market takes place or customers directly pay back for the subsidies. Additionally, we show that, in the feed-in tariff system, there is an interaction among incentive levels for renewable energy technologies. Given a certain feed-in tariff price to be set for a particular renewable technology, this price influences the optimal feed-in tariff price to be set for another technology.",Not About Sufficiency
Communities on a Threshold: Climate Action and Wellbeing Potentialities in Scotland,"Community projects provide opportunities for their participants to collectively undertake climate action and simultaneously experience alternative concepts of wellbeing.

Projects' achievements are contextualised in light of the urgent imperative to tackle climate change and against a background of social inequality. Liminal community projects are structurally constrained in their potential to create wider systemic changes. However, the projects' potential to promote wellbeing among their participants can intersect with climate change mitigation when systemic and wide-ranging changes are adopted. These changes must involve a meaningful shift towards an economy that centres wellbeing, framed through principles of environmental justice and promoting social equity.",Not About Sufficiency
Combining biophysical optimization with economic preference analysis for agricultural land-use allocation,"Agricultural production provides food, feed, and renewable energy, generates economic profits, and contributes to social welfare in many ways. However, intensive farming is one of the biggest threats to biodiversity. Although current market forces and regulations such as the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, seem to foster agricultural intensification, a socially and ecologically optimal land-use strategy should seek to reconcile agricultural production with biodiversity conservation. Research on spatial land-use allocation lacks studies that consider both aspects simultaneously. Therefore, we developed a method that finds land-use strategies with a maximum contribution to social welfare, taking into account the landscape's biophysical potential. We applied a multiobjective optimization algorithm that identified landscape configurations that maximize agricultural production and biodiversity based on their contribution to social welfare. Social welfare was approximated by the profit contribution of agricultural production and society's willingness to pay for biodiversity. The algorithm simultaneously evaluated the biophysical outcomes of different land uses using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and a biodiversity model. The method was applied to an agricultural landscape in central Germany. The results show that, in this area, overall social welfare can be increased compared to the status quo if both social benefits from biodiversity and economic profits from agricultural production are considered in land-use allocation. Further, the resulting optimal solutions can create win-win situations between the two, usually conflicting, objectives. The integration of preference information into the biophysical optimization allows reducing the usually large set of Pareto-optimal solutions and thus facilitates further stakeholder-based analyses. Our explorative study provides an example of how socioeconomic data and biophysical models can be combined to support decision making and the development of land-use policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Combinatorial Auction of Used Cars Considering Pro-Environment Attribute: A Social Welfare Perspective,"Air pollution is becoming more and more serious as the number of vehicles increases. To address such problems, many cities have implemented many measures, including the circular economy mode, in which used cars with low carbon emission are becoming important in the sustainable transportation and carbon abatement. Considering multi-attribute demand, this study designed combinatorial auction mechanism for the bidders of automobile enterprises on an online used-car platform to achieve social welfare maximization. Two kinds of attributes were considered, namely, price attribute and non-price attributes; the latter particularly included the pro-environment attribute based on an analysis of complementarity and substitutability. Moreover, the mechanism was proved to satisfy individual rational condition and incentive compatibility condition. Numerical application showed that preference for the pro-environment attribute can better realize social welfare and respond to national energy conservation and emission reduction targets. As a result, from the social welfare perspective, the multi-attribute combinatorial auction can provide a reference for more fair and effective allocation of used cars to bidders and can promote both buyer's utility and seller's income.",Not About Sufficiency
Links between humans and ecosystems: The implications of framing for health promotion strategies,"To explore potential links between ecosystems and human health, we set out three ways of seeing or frames: environmental hazards and burden of illness; ecosystem conditions and human well-being; and environmental justice and human core values. Each frame provides a basis for making connections but also poses certain challenges: expanding research methods, linking with other conditions of human well-being and clarifying value bases. We discuss actions which build on the strengths of the different frames to deal with the challenges: linking with those seeking greater ecosystem protection, focusing on clean production strategies, emphasizing environmental degradation as one aspect of social justice and building on concerns such as repoduction which are closer to human core values. Health promotion practitioners and policy makers can flexibly use the frames in arguing for the betterment of both ecosystems and humans.",Not About Sufficiency
Closing the Infrastructure Gap for Decarbonization: The Case for an Integrated Mineral Supply Agreement,"Significant amounts of feedstock metals will be required to build the infrastructure for the green energy transition. It is currently estimated, however, that the world may be facing an ""infrastructure gap"" that could prevent us from meeting United Nations Sustainable Development Goal targets. Prior investigations have focused on the extractive aspects of the mining industry to meet these targets and on looming bottlenecks and regional challenges in these upstream market segments. Scant attention has been paid to the downstream processing segments of the raw materials value chain, which also has a high degree of market concentration. Growing international tensions and geopolitical events have resulted in a shift toward ""reshoring"" and ""near-shoring"" of mining processing capabilities as regional powers attempt to make metal supply chains more secure. While increasing resilience, these shifts can also dilute the overall effectiveness of the global mining supply network and subsequently hamper the world's ability to close the green energy infrastructure gap. We argue that broadening the remit of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) to include coordinating these mission-critical metal processing functions can mitigate these issues. The G20 is one potential forum for enabling an integrated mineral processing agreement under the auspices of IRENA.",Not About Sufficiency
Climatic Impacts of Land-Use Change due to Crop Yield Increases and a Universal Carbon Tax from a Scenario Model,"Future land cover will have a significant impact on climate and is strongly influenced by the extent of agricultural land use. Differing assumptions of crop yield increase and carbon pricing mitigation strategies affect projected expansion of agricultural land in future scenarios. In the representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), the carbon effects of these land cover changes are included, although the biogeophysical effects are not. The afforestation in RCP4.5 has important biogeophysical impacts on climate, in addition to the land carbon changes, which are directly related to the assumption of crop yield increase and the universal carbon tax. To investigate the biogeophysical climatic impact of combinations of agricultural crop yield increases and carbon pricing mitigation, five scenarios of land-use change based on RCP4.5 are used as inputs to an earth system model [Hadley Centre Global Environment Model, version 2-Earth System (HadGEM2-ES)]. In the scenario with the greatest increase in agricultural land (as a result of no increase in crop yield and no climate mitigation) there is a significant -0.49 K worldwide cooling by 2100 compared to a control scenario with no land-use change. Regional cooling is up to -2.2 K annually in northeastern Asia. Including carbon feedbacks from the land-use change gives a small global cooling of -0.067 K. This work shows that there are significant impacts from biogeophysical land-use changes caused by assumptions of crop yield and carbon mitigation, which mean that land carbon is not the whole story. It also elucidates the potential conflict between cooling from biogeophysical climate effects of land-use change and wider environmental aims.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate protection or privilege? A whole systems justice milieu of twenty negative emissions and solar geoengineering technologies,"In this study, we utilize a large and diverse expert interview exercise (N = 125) to critically examine the whole systems justice issues associated with ten negative emissions and ten solar geoengineering technologies. We ask: What equity and justice concerns arise with these 20 options? What particular vulnerable groups could be affected? What risks do these options entail for communities or the climate? Utilizing a ""claims making"" approach, we examine existing and prospective injustices across a pluralistic whole systems framework analyzing (i) resource extraction issues including minerals, chemicals, and fertilizers (ii) manufacturing, labor and ownership concerns, (iii) transportation-network and land-grabbing dynamics, (iv) unfair and exclusionary policymaking and planning, (v) operational injustices resulting from deployment and use, and (vi) waste flows, liabilities and disposal requirements. We then explore how these potential concerns culminate in a milieu of injustice cutting across the dimensions of distribution (who gets what), recognition (who counts), participation (who gets heard), capabilities (what matters), and responsibility (who does what).

Climate Policy Reduces Racial Disparities in Air Pollution from Transportation and Power Generation,"Energy system optimization models facilitate analyses on a national or regional scale. However, understanding the impacts of climate policy on specific populations requires a much higher spatial resolution. Here, we link an energy system optimization model to an integrated assessment model via an emission downscaling algorithm, translating air pollution emissions from nine U.S. regions to U.S. counties. We simulate the impacts of six distinct policy scenarios, including a current policy and a 2050 net-zero target, on NO x , SO2, and PM2.5 emissions from on-road transportation and electricity generation. We compare different policies based on their ability to reduce emission exposure and exposure disparity across racial groups, allowing decision-makers to assess the air pollution impacts of various policy instruments more holistically. Modeled policies include a clean electricity standard, an on-road ICE vehicle ban, a carbon tax, and a scenario that reaches net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. While exposure and disparities decrease in all scenarios, our results reveal persistent disparities until at least 2040, particularly for Black non-Hispanic Americans. Our estimates of avoided deaths due to air pollution emphasize the importance of policy timing, showing that thousands of lives can be saved by taking action in the near-term.",Not About Sufficiency
Climate justice in land use planning: Exploring the potential and challenges of nature-based solutions integration in Nigeria,"Land use management stands at the forefront of addressing the intricate challenges posed by climate change while balancing societal needs and environmental sustainability. In the face of climate disasters, such as flooding, the urgency to reevaluate land management practices becomes paramount. Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) have emerged as a promising approach, leveraging natural resilience to mitigate climate change impacts, and offering additional benefits like biodiversity conservation and community well-being. However, the integration of NbS into urban planning raises critical considerations regarding climate justice. Concerns revolve around the equitable distribution of benefits and burdens, with the risk of NbS disproportionately benefiting affluent communities. Moreover, the framing of NbS as alternatives or complements to technological solutions raises questions about perpetuating environmental injustices and exacerbating social inequalities. Long-term sustainability and management of NbS, coupled with the need for community engagement and participatory decision-making, further complicate the integration process. The Nigerian context exemplifies these challenges, with existing land use policies struggling to accommodate NbS principles amidst fragmentation and ambiguity. The Land Use Act of 1978 falls short in addressing the needs of stakeholders in informal settlements, perpetuating marginalization, and hindering effective climate adaptation efforts. Against this backdrop, this study aims to unravel specific barriers within Nigerian land use policies impeding NbS integration and climate adaptation. Through insights from policymakers, planners, and stakeholders, this research seeks to illuminate pathways for policy reforms fostering inclusive and effective climate adaptation strategies. Ultimately, the findings aspire to equip policymakers and planners with actionable insights to navigate Nigeria's complex climate adaptation landscape, promoting resilience and sustainability amid changing climatic conditions.",Not About Sufficiency
Cleaning Up Metal Contamination after Decades of Energy Production and Manufacturing: Reviewing the Value in Use of Biochars for a Sustainable Future,"The lasting impact of ancestral energy production operations and global manufacturing has not only generated substantial CO2 emissions, but it has also led to the release of metal-based pollutants into Earth's water bodies. As we continue to engineer, mine (coal and metals), and now bore into geothermal wells/fracking sites for alternative energy sources, we continue to contaminate drinking water supplies with heavy metals through infiltration and diffusion, limiting progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals 3 (Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good health and well-being), 6 (Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation), 14 (Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life below water), and 15 (Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on land). This review shows how the research community has designed and developed mesoporous biochars with customizable pore systems, as well as functionalized biochars, to extract various heavy metals from water sources. This article investigates how biochar materials (non-activated, activated, functionalized, or hybrid structures) can be adapted to suit their purpose, highlighting their recyclability/regeneration and performance when remediating metal-based pollution in place of conventional activated carbons. By utilizing the wider circular economy, ""waste-derived"" carbonaceous materials will play a pivotal role in water purification for both the developed/developing world, where mining and heavy manufacturing generate the most substantial contribution to water pollution.

Economic development vs. sustainable societies: Reflections on the players in a crucial contest,"The World Commission on Environment and Development adopted and legitimated the idea of sustainable development in its report Our Common Future. Without substantiation, WCED claimed that economic growth and environmental protection were compatible. The 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro adopted the idea, without further testing, as its intellectual core. Since 1992, the United Nations, the United States, and many other nations have created agencies to track progress toward sustainable development. In favor of the idea are individuals, including, it appears, most economists, who advocate centralization, internationalization, and rapid economic development. The opposition consists principally of people from academic disciplines, especially ecologists and humanists. This group does not communicate effectively, but if it did, it might agree that: economic development and environmental protection are not compatible; insistence by economists that all natural resources be given a dollar value is useless, if not harmful; biodiversity has intrinsic value; sustainable development weakens local autonomy; and social welfare is a key component of environmental health. To strengthen the defense of ecosystems, ecologists, humanists, and others should apply their knowledge to practical environmental problems. By making their knowledge accessible in local political arenas, they will concurrently shore up the ability of local units to protect their environments and speak with force in larger political arenas.

Circular economy indicators for measuring social innovation in the Brazilian textile and fashion industry,"The Brazilian textile and fashion industry impacts directly and indirectly 8 million people, a context in which social indicators become even more significant. However, while job creation has been highlighted as one of the social benefits of the circular economy, few social indicators have been explicitly included for its impact measurement. Furthermore, considering that tools and methods are needed to link business decisions with social effects, social sustainability measures are needed. Based on the literature review, this research has identified indicators to measure the capacity of the Brazilian textile and fashion industry to promote social innovation in the circular economy. The 37 indicators identified were rated on a 7-point Likert scale by 29 experts representing the industry, representative entities of the textile and fashion sector, and institutions engaged in human and labour rights. Three other indicators were appointed by the experts. As result, 40 indicators are proposed according to the classification: employment; labour/management relations; occupational health and safety; training and education; diversity and equal opportunity; and fair distribution of income. These findings can provide a practical tool for circular economy practitioners and researchers and contribute to the improvement of measuring methods and monitoring of the social aspects of labour towards the circular economy in the textile and fashion industry.",Not About Sufficiency
Circular economy for phosphorus supply chain and its impact on social sustainable development goals,"To be able to grow crops, we have interfered with Earth's reserves of one of top three essential elements, phosphorus (P), as to which we face a problem related to its high consumption compared to available resources. This forces us to follow the alternative of closing the phosphorus loop from a circular economy perspective. However, there is a lack of research on regional and global social sustainability in this area, as emphasized in the United Nations' Agenda 2030 goals for sustainable development. In this paper, we address social challenges involved in global phosphorus supply chain, such as eradicating poverty, child labor and malnutrition; promoting gender equality; providing decent work and economic growth; maintaining sustainable water use; and achieving food security. Our research is driven by the question of whether the circular economy aims to direct phosphorus management towards tackling social issues associated with its supply chain. We use system dynamics modelling by combining the concept of material flow analysis and social life cycle assessment. Detailed analysis at regional and global levels indicates a paradoxical social impact of phosphorus circular model. This reflects the multiple stakeholders involved, and the regional interactions with phosphorus circular economy transitions. Improvements can be demonstrated in reducing poverty and providing safer work environment in many regions, e.g., Western Asia (93%), New Zealand, Central Asia, and Europe (44-61%), while achieving employment targets is limited in Northern and Eastern Europe. Circular model fails to promote gender equality, it also exacerbates exploitative child work problem for the Caribbean and most Africa. It provides sufficient nutrition to North America, Australia/New Zealand, and Northern Europe. It achieves water use targets in several regions with 53% savings worldwide. Finally, circular model contributes to P efficiency (average balance of 1.21 kgP/ha) and strengthens P security within most regions with an average of 64%. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Circular Economy and the Changing Geography of International Trade in Plastic Waste,"Plastic pollution has become a major environmental concern worldwide. As the circular economy is increasingly seen as a means for achieving sustainable development, it is imperative to promote the more efficient use of plastics worldwide. An integral part of the circular economy model, trade in waste, and the scrap for recovery is a part of the solution to achieve sustainability. This paper studies the changing geography of the international trade in plastic waste. It reveals increasingly complex patterns of the transboundary trade in plastic waste over more than two decades. The movement of plastic waste from high-income countries to developing nations has been the largest flow, but trade flows of other directions turn out to be significant. The findings of the paper debunk the North-South or core-periphery dichotomy that is embedded in the international environment justice tradition (including the ecologically unequal exchange theory) as well as in international environmental regulatory regimes such as the Basel Convention. The paper contributes to the discussions about value that are central in political economic approaches to global trade (e.g., the global value chain and global production network) by demonstrating the relative, spatial, and dynamic nature of the concept. As the transboundary trade in plastic waste has exacerbated pollution and marine litter in some major receiving countries, it needs to be better monitored and regulated to ensure it is conducted in a transparent and environmentally sound manner. The paper also explores several policy measures that could help tackle the plastic pollution crisis and achieve sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Heterogeneous material mechanics at warioys scales,"Some contemporary problems involving the mechanics of materials will be examined at widely different length scales. The three scales chosen are i) the near atomic scale, ii) an intermediate range of the order of microns, and iii) large scale macro or structural behavior. An additional theme transcending these scales will be carbon based, or carbon like heterogeneous material behavior. At the near atomic scale, examples are chosen from the various forms that elemental carbon can take including diamond, graphite, newly discovered fullerenes, and ideal carbon fibers. Examples at the intermediate length scale feature low density materials, since typical cell sizes are about a micron or somewhat larger or smaller. The effect of microstructure becomes the dominant and determining characteristic of such materials. A hierarchy of microstructures will be revealed which gives a coherent connection between microstructure and mechanical behavior. Finally, at the macroscale, involving structural behavior, a methodology for the life prediction of fiber dominated, graphite epoxy composites will be given. These three classes of problems are intended to show that virtually equal opportunities for meaningful research contribution occur across the spectrum of length scales. © 1994 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.",Not About Sufficiency

Challenges and opportunities for operationalizing the safe and just operating space concept at regional scale,"The concept of a safe and just operating space (SJOS) provided through combining the safe operating space (SOS) concept and the doughnut framework, delineates boundaries for ecological processes (e.g. climate change) and social wellbeing (e.g. food) at global scale. The integration of social wellbeing into the SOS concept through defining boundaries for humanity has become known as a SJOS concept. Although various studies have attempted to operationalize this SJOS concept, no synthesis has been conducted of the progress made and the obstacles faced. To address this need, we reviewed empirical studies and developed a conceptual framework of four operational steps for identifying the challenges and opportunities in operationalizing SJOS for regional social-ecological systems (SES). The steps include: 1) Understanding the SES to investigate the genesis in terms of selecting indicators and contextualization, which also include challenges such as selection of indicators, data availability and framework development to operationalize the SJOS concept; 2) Exploring the systems by understanding and unravelling the SES dynamics (e.g. feedbacks, nonlinearity) due to the limitation of existing modelling approaches; 3) Understanding the system governance by integrating stakeholders' visions and equity dimension of sustainability and conceptualizing the SJOS; 4) The communication of SJOS entails additional layers of complexity as this concept integrates diverse challenges (e.g. equity) and disciplines into the sustainability assessment. In contrast, overcoming the challenges offers opportunities for transformation to sustainability within the limits of SES across different scales.

"The (FWE)2 nexus: Bridging food, food waste, water, energy, and ecosystems for circular systems and sustainable development","The imperative for sustainable resource management has become increasingly critical in the context of a rapidly expanding global population and heightened resource demands, compounded by the pressing challenges of climate change and environmental degradation. Traditional sector-specific approaches, which frequently isolate agriculture, energy, and water management, have proven inadequate in addressing the complex interdependencies inherent in resource ecosystems. In this regard, the Food, Food Waste, Water, Energy, and Ecosystems ((FWE)²) nexus framework emerges as a transformative paradigm that advocates for an integrated understanding of these interconnected components. This framework is essential for the implementation of comprehensive strategies designed to address the multifaceted sustainability challenges confronting contemporary society. The current research undertakes a comprehensive investigation of the (FWE)² nexus framework, elucidating the dynamic interactions among food systems, waste management, water utilization, energy production, and ecosystem integrity. Through an extensive synthesis of the current literature, illustrative case studies, and empirical analyses, multifaceted dynamics inherent to the nexus were outlined. Key themes prominently featured include the necessity of conceptualizing food waste (FW) as a critical resource, the strategic deployment of technology to enhance operational efficiency, and the integration of circular economy principles to optimize resource utilization. Collectively, these elements advocate for sustainable practices that can yield substantive benefits for society and the environment. The (FWE)² nexus framework is essential for tackling the intertwined challenges of food production, FW management, water resources, energy consumption, and ecosystem health. Policymakers should prioritize collaborative efforts that unite government agencies, businesses, and communities. This synergy can create comprehensive strategies that enhance resource governance and improve global food security. Additionally, initiatives focused on public education and community engagement are vital, empowering individuals to actively participate in sustainable resource management and fostering significant societal and environmental benefits. This research demonstrates the considerable potential of the (FWE)² nexus framework in advancing several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Optimizing agricultural practices and reducing FW directly support SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by enhancing food security and nutrition. Furthermore, Considering FW as a valuable resource aligns with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), promoting sustainable consumption and waste reduction through circular economy principles that facilitate nutrient recovery and renewable energy generation.

"Caveats in Environmental Justice, Consumption and Ecological Footprints: The Relationship and Policy Implications of Socioeconomic Rank and Sustainable Consumption Patterns","The study evaluates the sustainability of consumption patterns among different socioeconomic deciles based on individual ecological footprints generated by four of the world's most polluting industries: animal products/meat, textiles, transport, and residential energy. Online shopping is also considered due to its mounting popularity. A national survey, which ensured equal representation of socioeconomic deciles, involving 600 respondents in Israel was conducted, supplemented by follow-up semi-structured personal interviews with 25 participants. Conventional wisdom supports the notion that wealthier segments of society produce greater ecological footprints in all aspects of their consumption. In fact, our findings reveal that patterns are more nuanced and that there are areas in which poorer populations reveal less sustainable consumption patterns: poorer populations in the lower deciles report a greater per capita ecological footprint in their purchases of textiles and food consumption. By contrast, wealthier deciles have relatively larger ecological footprints in the areas of transport and residential patterns (which drive their energy consumption). Results suggest that some of the fundamental assumptions among environmental justice advocates regarding contrasting consumption patterns in affluent and poorer segments of society are not always supported by empirical evidence. Findings also indicate that there is room for greater government interventions to facilitate more sustainable consumption patterns among poorer populations.",Not About Sufficiency
"Causes and Measures of Poverty, Inequality, and Social Exclusion: A Review","Prevailing measures on the topics of monetary and non-monetary poverty-as well as economic and carbon inequality-are being critically assessed under sustainable development goals (SDGs) with a worldwide perspective. On the one hand, the poverty headcount ratio and the indices poverty gap, poverty severity, and Watts are assessed as core poverty indices. On the other hand, important inequality measures such as the Gini index and the Palma ratio are evaluated in order to find their potentials for policymaking. Furthermore, social exclusion (with the extreme forms of aporophobia and homelessness) has detrimental ramifications on human wellbeing and disturbs public provision policies. Thus, poverty, inequality, and social exclusion are integral parts of SDGs (1, 6 and 10), emphasizing the multidisciplinary nature of the above issues. Additionally, intrinsic elements of Agenda 2030 and the measuring of poverty, inequality, and polarization would significantly improve integrated policy pathways in the national and international fora.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing environmental justice using Bayesian hierarchical models: Two case studies,"Sound statistical methodology for assessing environmental justice is clearly needed, but has been slow to develop. In this paper, we investigate the use of hierarchical Bayesian methods for combining disparate sources of environmental data featuring complex correlations over both space and time. After a brief review of the Bayesian approach and its specific application to disease mapping problems, we illustrate two case studies. The first of these investigates the effect of a certain nuclear fuel reprocessing facility in Ohio on the lung cancer rates in the counties that surround it, while the second concerns the relation between air quality (especially in terms of ambient ozone levels) and pediatric emergency room visits due to asthma in the Atlanta metro area. We close by summarizing the method's implications for environmental justice, as well as future methodological and applied work.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon tax or sustainable aviation fuel quota,"In this paper, we build a simple model to compare two policies, i.e., carbon tax and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) quota, in curbing the greenhouse gas emission from the aviation industry. We consider two policy objectives, which are emission oriented, i.e., controlling the expected total emission under a certain level; and social welfare oriented, i.e., maximizing the expected social welfare level. With emission-oriented policies, we find that the more ambitious the emission target is, the more likely that SAF quota outperforms carbon tax in emission control if the realized price of the traditional aviation fuel (TAF) is lower than the expected value. Besides, it is more likely that SAF quota can lead to higher social welfare level than carbon tax if the price of SAF decreases. With welfare-oriented policies, the emission level is higher under carbon tax than under SAF quota when the SAF price is sufficiently low. However, carbon tax can lead to higher social welfare level than SAF quota when there is no uncertainty in the TAF price.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon tax effect difference on net-zero carbon emissions target and social welfare level promotion,"This research aims to find the best carbon tax regime for the achievement of net-zero carbon emissions and promotion of social welfare level.

Industrial transformation not only causes changes in product substitution and product price elasticity of demand, but also makes these two regimes have different effects on the achievement of net-zero carbon emissions and promotion of social welfare level.",Not About Sufficiency
Carbon emissions abatement with duopoly generators and eco-conscious consumers: Carbon tax vs carbon allowance,"With electrification and economic development, global carbon emissions are rising every year. Among them, the power industry accounted for the highest proportion of carbon emissions. To combat climate change, environmental pollution and economic losses caused by greenhouse effect, governments implement low-carbon policies in the electricity market. Considering the impact of generators' carbon emissions on consumers behaviors and environmental benefit, this paper compares two main emission reduction policies - carbon tax and carbon allowance in a market with two asymmetric generators and a group of heterogeneous eco-conscious consumers. Despite the widespread belief that environmental advocacy hurts economic performance and social welfare, we find that both policies improve social welfare due to price increases or production restrictions. And when neither generator has a significant cost advantage, the social welfare under carbon allowance is higher than that under carbon tax, and the total carbon emissions are lower. This is because the carbon tax indirectly regulates generators' output and total welfare by affecting prices. While carbon allowance can directly regulate generators' output through capacity limits, and further improve the total social welfare. Through numerical analysis, the optimal emission reduction strategies of the government under different conditions are determined. We also extend the main model and show that the key results are still valid. (c) 2023 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Decarbonising Romania’s economy,"Romania’s clean energy transition needs to accelerate for the country to decarbonise its economy by mid-century. Following an impressive decline from the early 1990s, emissions of greenhouse gases have stopped falling in recent years. Fossil fuel dependence, an increasing and ageing vehicle fleet and poorly insulated buildings increase energy use and carbon intensity. Moving away from fossil fuels in Romania calls primarily for more renewables; shifting to electricity in transport and buildings; substantial energy savings; and improved transport systems. This paper identifies policies that would help bring about these changes cost effectively, while minimising the socio-economic impact of the transition and contributing to improving people’s quality of life. The policy package should include institutional reforms and public investment, regulatory changes, financial support and consistent price signals to encourage private abatement actions. Measures to alleviate the impact of the net-zero transition on vulnerable communities and to adapt to climate change are also required.",Not About Sufficiency

"Environmental justice, regulation, and the local community","This article examines the sociological significance of the concept of 'environmental justice' for grassroots groups responding to toxic contamination in their local communities. Taking into account nationwide mobilization patterns in such communities, the author documents a precedent- setting episode in the city of Jacksonville, Arkansas, where citizen protests and support from national environmental groups led the Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw three Technical Assistance Grants inappropriately awarded to a group with links to a polluting industry, and subsequently to rewrite the rules for participation in such grants. As the first such challenge nationally, the Jacksonville scenario is an important 'test case' and permits a theoretical and practical evaluation of the relationship between social groups, technology, and the governmental regulatory process. More particularly, it gives insight into the Technical Assistance Grants program, which was set up to enable citizens living close to contaminated sites to interpret and evaluate technical information relating to such sites, but which has been undercut by a weak EPA and cooptation efforts by industries. The article concludes with an exploration of the concept of community in relation to the new construction of environmental justice engaged in by grassroots groups fighting contamination locally and nationally.",Not About Sufficiency
Can universities catalyze social innovation to support their own rapid decarbonization? Assessment of community and governance readiness at the University of California,"Universities aspire to lead on sustainable energy transitions, yet progress toward reducing their own emissions has been challenging. We assessed barriers and opportunities for engagement of University of California (UC) campus communities in stimulating more deliberate and rapid campus energy transformation, and our findings highlight the complexity of the socio-technical and governance systems that limit potential for transformative change for decarbonization. Through surveys, interviews, focus groups, and content analysis, we found strong interest among students, faculty, and staff in advancing decarbonization. We found a preference for local and on-campus solutions such as energy efficiency, behavioral change, renewable-energy production, and electrification, and much less support for market offsets and non-local investments. We also found that students and faculty had limited knowledge and sense of agency regarding campus-based decarbonization programs and options, which is consistent with the limited availability of data and information about these programs beyond the few who are directly involved. Weaving our findings with insights from social-innovation theory, we propose an action research agenda that conceives of university operations and governance systems as loci for socio-technical energy transition experiments. In alignment with higher education's long-standing commitments to catalyzing social innovation, opening university energy operations and governance to inclusive, community-led collaborative experimentation has strong potential to create the conditions necessary to produce the social innovation so desperately needed for energy system transformation within universities and beyond.",Not About Sufficiency
Can the 1.5 °C warming target be met in a global transition to 100% renewable energy?,"First, we recognize the valuable previous studies which model renewable energy growth with complete termination of fossil fuels along with assumptions of the remaining carbon budgets to reach IPCC warming targets. However, these studies use very complex combined economic/physical modeling and commonly lack transparency regarding the sensitivity to assumed inputs. Moreover, it is not clear that energy poverty with its big present impact in the global South has been eliminated in their scenarios. Further, their CO2-equivalent natural gas emission factors are underestimated, which will have significant impact on the computed greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, we address this question in a transparent modeling study: can the 1.5 degrees C warming target still be met with an aggressive phaseout of fossil fuels coupled with a 100% replacement by renewable energy? We compute the continuous generation of global wind/solar energy power along with the cumulative carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in a complete phaseout of fossil fuels over a 20 year period. We compare these computed emissions with the state-of-the-science estimates for the remaining carbon budget of carbon dioxide emissions consistent with the 1.5 degrees C warming target, concluding that it is still possible to meet this warming target if the creation of a global 100% renewable energy transition of sufficient capacity begins very soon which will likely be needed to power aggressive negative carbon emission technology. The latter is focused on direct air capture for crustal storage. More efficient renewable technologies in the near future will make this transition easier and promote the implementation of a global circular economy. Taking into account technological improvements in 2 nd law (exergy) efficiencies reducing the necessary global energy demand, the renewable supply should likely be no more than 1.5 times the present level, with the capacity to eliminate global energy poverty, for climate mitigation and adaptation.",Not About Sufficiency
Can carbon tax revenue recycling coordinate climate mitigation and energy poverty alleviation?,"Energy poverty is a key dimension of multidimensional poverty and a major challenge for climate action. This study examines how climate policies affect energy poverty, especially the role of carbon tax revenue recycling in coordinating climate mitigation and energy poverty alleviation. Using an integrated Climate-Economy-Energy Poverty (RICE-EP) model that incorporates inequality aspects of energy poverty, the study analyzes the effects of climate policies on household energy consumption. The study simulates various scenarios of climate actions and carbon tax revenue recycling and finds that: i) Carbon tax revenue recycling can simultaneously advance climate change mitigation and energy poverty reduction goals, it can promote climate mitigation and enhance equity by lowering the abatement costs borne by low-income populations; ii) However, the interactions between stringent climate targets and energy affordability are complex. Modeling suggests that even optimal revenue recycling fails to prevent exacerbated energy poverty among disadvantaged groups under ambitious 2 degrees C climate targets; iii) Analysis indicates that an emissions reduction rate approaching 43 %, enabled by a carbon tax calibrated to incentivize an equitable transition, could maximize alleviation of energy poverty by directing subsidy support to low-income groups.

Can a just transition achieve decarbonization? Explaining fossil fuel community opposition in the Canadian Oil Sands,"Just transition policies are widely viewed as one of the most effective mechanisms for compensating and building support for decarbonization in fossil fuel communities. However, early empirical work suggests that many coal-producing regions remain opposed to decarbonization even when just transition policies are proposed or implemented. In this study, I add to and nuance existing accounts by analyzing data from 18 interviews with oil and gas workers and community members in the Canadian Oil Sands, the world's third-largest fossil fuel reserve. I show how those living and working in the Oil Sands remain skeptical of renewable energy, optimistic about the long-term viability of fossil fuels, and strongly oppose the proposal for a just transition. These responses are patterned by feelings of fear, exclusion, and resentment towards the motives and actors driving decarbonization, which I argue demonstrates a threatened sense of ontological security. Reframing decarbonization and just transition policies as an issue of ontological security encourages scholars and policy makers to prioritize the social and emotional impacts of decarbonization and reconsider the conditions necessary for a just transition.",Not About Sufficiency

It delivers an attempt at such a framework through which three specific cases of energy transitions-Norway, Germany, and Poland-are investigated. These countries represent three energy regimes, different socioeconomic and energy systems, and face other challenges. Despite these differences, the outbreak of the war shows the need for a common policy agenda to avoid negative repercussions, such as social cohesion crises.

Results show that the synergistic effect leads to an additional reduction of 1.2% in carbon emissions, along with a decrease of 4.2% in economic losses. Despite challenges like increased energy external dependency and carbon leakage, the synergistic effect shows a positive externality between policies, reducing the carbon intensity and marginal emission mitigation costs. Furthermore, these synergistic effects yield positive consequences for social welfare, particularly benefiting rural households and fostering equitable distribution of carbon mitigation benefits across societal groups. These findings underscore the importance of considering policy synergies between carbon emissions trading and energy efficiency policies to ensure the total effect of climate change mitigation strategies.",Not About Sufficiency

Is our energy system sustainable? Gap analysis of fuel supply and demand in Indonesia,"The adverse environmental impact of fossil fuel use, including greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂) driving global warming and climate change, is well-documented. Furthermore, fossil fuel supply chains are highly vulnerable to disruptions, often exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, resulting in global energy crises. Reducing reliance on unsustainable resources through an energy transition and ensuring supply stability to support energy access aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7). This study aims to analyze energy system vulnerabilities by examining supply-demand gaps in Indonesia’s fuel sector, and assess energy sustainability using the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) framework, focusing on energy security and fossil fuel import dependence as key indicators. Results reveal a positive trend in Indonesia’s fuel supply chain over the past decade, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 2.6% in fuel production, 0.7% in consumption, and a 1.6% annual decrease in imports. However, average values over the last 10 years indicate a significant supply-demand gap: annual fuel demand averages 69,069 kL, while production averages 47,344 kL, meeting only 68.58% of demand. This leaves a shortfall of 21,724 kL (31.42%), which is offset by imports averaging 26,805.50 kL. These findings highlight vulnerabilities that threaten energy security and underscore the unsustainability of the current energy system.

"Fairness, effectiveness, and needs satisfaction: new options for designing climate policies","Financial compensations are often proposed to address regressive distributional impacts of carbon taxes. While financial compensations have shown to benefit vulnerable groups distributionally, little is known about their impacts on emission reduction or needs satisfaction. A potential problem with cash compensations is that if households spend this money back into the economy while no additional decarbonisation policies are implemented, emission reductions that arose from the tax may at least partly be reversed. In this letter, we compare the emission savings and impacts on fuel and transport poverty of two compensation options for carbon taxes in 27 European countries. The first option consists of equal per capita rebates for home energy and motor fuel taxes. The second option is the provision of universal green vouchers for renewable electricity and public transport, supported by additional investments in green infrastructures to meet increased demand for such green consumption. Results show that the first option of tax rebates only supports small emission reductions. In contrast, universal green vouchers with expanded green infrastructures would reduce home energy emissions by 92.3 MtCO2e or 13.4%, and motor fuel emissions by 177.5 MtCO2e or 23.8%. If green vouchers and infrastructure were provided without a prior tax, emission savings would be slightly lower compared to the ‘tax and voucher’ scheme, but fuel and transport poverty would drop by 4.1 and 2.2 percentage points, respectively. In contrast, taxes with rebates would increase fuel and transport poverty by 4.1 and 1.8 percentage points. These findings demonstrate that it is important to take environmental and energy poverty impacts of compensations for unfair distributional impacts of climate policies into account at the design stage. Such compensation measures can achieve higher emission reductions and reduce energy poverty if they involve an expansion of the provision of green goods and services, and if everyone is given fair access to these goods and services.",Not About Sufficiency
Economics versus ecology: two contrasting views of the world,"Economists foresee a rosy future, while ecologists warn of impending global disaster.

One improved measure of well-being is the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines data on life expectancy at birth, literacy rates, and adjusted gross domestic product. However, the HDI does not take environmental health into consideration. The most comprehensive indicator of well-being is Daly and Cobb's Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare. This takes into account average consumption, distribution and environmental degradation. But it depends on data available in only a handful of developed nations - a drawback that it shares with the HDI. More relevant to Third World countries is an index of per capita grain consumption.

Citizens are perceived as key players in the energy systems, as their direct involvement can contribute to the wide spread of improved behaviours and clean energy production. This paper explores Community Transition Pathways (CTPs), an innovative instrument to support energy citizenship effectively. CTPs guide citizens through structured paths, addressing diverse communities. Grounded in energy citizenship theories, the concept integrates insights from literature and policy developments.

Blue growth and blue justice: Ten risks and solutions for the ocean economy,"The oceans are increasingly viewed as a new frontier for economic development. Yet, as companies and governments race to capitalize on marine resources, substantial risks can arise for people and the environment. The dominant discourse that frames blue growth as beneficial for the economy, developing nations, and coastal communities risks downplaying the uneven distribution of benefits and potential harms. Civil society organizations and academics alike have been sounding the alarm about the social justice implications of rapid and unchecked ocean development. Here, we review existing literature to highlight ten social injustices that might be produced by blue growth: 1) dispossession, displacement and ocean grabbing; 2) environmental justice concerns from pollution and waste; 3) environmental degradation and reduction of ecosystem services; 4) livelihood impacts for small-scale fishers; 5) lost access to marine resources needed for food security and well-being; 6) inequitable distribution of economic benefits; 7) social and cultural impacts; 8) marginalization of women; 9) human and Indigenous rights abuses; and, 10) exclusion from governance. Through this critical review, we aim to stimulate a rigorous dialogue on future pathways to achieve a more just and inclusive ocean economy. We contend that a commitment to 'blue justice' must be central to the blue growth agenda, which requires greater attention to addressing the 10 risks that we have highlighted, and propose practical actions to incorporate recognitional, procedural, and distributional justice into the future ocean economy.

Biofuel as social fuel: Introducing socio-environmental services as a means to reduce global inequity?,"The increasing cultivation of energy crops for biofuel production has significantly altered the focus of the agricultural sector, but the impact of biofuel production and use is not merely an agricultural one. Even more importantly, it is an issue, which likely promotes inequitable conditions and the social conflict of different (basic) needs. Within this context, the dominant argument criticizes the growing demand for biofuels in the north to compromise food security and sovereignty in the south. In order to address these trade-offs and conflicts, the objective of this paper is the introduction of a conceptual framework of socio-environmental services. By expanding the construct of environmental services to explicitly include the social dimension, it shall accommodate for the fact that the provision of environmental services is often embedded in a complex system of global (economic, ecological as well as social) interdependencies. Recently, the concept of payments for environmental services (PES) has received much attention with respect to its potential contribution to both environmental sustainability and the economic alleviation of poverty.

The damage caused to managed and natural systems by soil degradation threatens livelihoods and local services and leads to national socio‐economic disruption. Human‐induced soil degradation results from land clearing and deforestation, inappropriate agricultural practices, improper management of industrial effluents and wastes, careless management of forests, surface mining, urban sprawl, and ill‐planned commercial and industrial development. Of these, inappropriate agricultural practices, including excessive tillage and use of heavy machinery, over‐grazing, excessive and unbalanced use of inorganic fertilizers, poor irrigation and water management techniques, pesticide overuse, inadequate crop residue and/or organic carbon inputs, and poor crop cycle planning, account for nearly 40% (121 Mha) of land degradation across India. Globally, human activities related to agriculture contribute to the transgression of four of the nine Planetary Boundaries proposed by Rockström et al. (2009): Climate Change, Biodiversity Integrity, Land‐system Change, and altered Phosphorus and Nitrogen Biogeochemical Flows. This review focuses on how knowledge of soil processes in agriculture has developed in India over the past 10 years, and the potential of soil science to meet the objectives of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger (End hunger, achieve food security, improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture), using the context of the four most relevant Planetary Boundaries as a framework. Solutions to mitigate soil degradation and improve soil health in different regions using conservation agricultural approaches have been proposed. Thus, in this review we (1) summarize the outputs of recent innovative research in India that has explored the impacts of soil degradation on four Planetary Boundaries (Climate Change, Biodiversity Loss, Land‐system Change, and altered Biogeochemical Flows of Phosphorus and Nitrogen) and vice‐versa; and (2) identify the knowledge gaps that require urgent attention to inform developing soil science research agendas in India, to advise policy makers, and to support those whose livelihoods rely on the land.",Not About Sufficiency
Beyond environmental sustainability: Low-carbon land use policies can contribute to the realization of comprehensive sustainable development,"In the context of climate change and sustainable development, there has been numerous researches studying the influence of land use policies on carbon sequestration. However, most of them focus on specific experimental area to explore the impact of land use policies on carbon fixation, or their impacts on a certain aspect, lacking the comprehensive explanation of both the internal influence mechanism and external effects. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive review and the results show that scientific land use policies have the capacity of increasing net carbon sinks and soil organic carbon to realize environmental sustainability. In addition, these low-carbon land use policies can not only bring out this climate change mitigation influence, but also have external effects on cities sustainable development, food security, ecological protection, and economic disparities to promote comprehensive sustainable development. However, if these policies fail to adapt to local natural and socio-economic conditions, or overlook the potential negative impacts they could pose, these policies cannot facilitate the achievement of comprehensive sustainable development and could even impede this progress.",Not About Sufficiency
Beyond carbon: Unveiling vulnerabilities of the transportation fuel system for climate resilience,"Carbon-centric policies that omit the Transportation Fuel System (TFS) vulnerabilities as a critical infrastructure (CI) will result in siloed climate resilience policies for future transportation energy systems. Based on CI resilience, disaster risk reduction, supply chain sustainability, energy and climate adaptation literature, this study seeks to learn from the contemporary TFS vulnerabilities to avoid perpetuating them in a future climate-resilient, equitable, and carbon free transportation energy system. A unique combination of five vulnerability traits is identified: unprecedented transition; complex and widespread interdependencies; hazardous materials; complex organizational networks; and path-dependency. Emblematic TFS-related disasters in the U.S., and the projected impact of wildfires and flooding to the sector in California are explored to illustrate these vulnerabilities and their environmental justice (EJ) issues. We argue that our lack of knowledge of CI sociotechnical networks is a key vulnerability that jeopardizes societal goals of decarbonization policies, notably those concerning (1) procedural justice and (2) the identification of transportation energy services critical users such as emergency response. We propose framing the TFS as a social, technical, and environmental system to promote complex system governance that is more capable of identifying strategic partnerships and coalitions for CI resilience, and developing methods to study and implement climate risk transparency and adaptation attribution that advances procedural aspects of EJ for the transitional and future TFS.",Not About Sufficiency
Beyond a garden: Alignment of Sustainable Development Goals with botanic gardens,"The United Nations' (UNs) 2030 ""Sustainable Development Goals are a universal call to action to protect the planet and improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere."" This requires much effort of in governmental policies along with public and private sector practices. With regard to this, BGs have a crucial role in bringing this vision of the future. Of the 17 SDGs, Target 15-Life on land is directly associated with the traditional work of botanic gardens (BGs). But other four goals (2-Zero hunger, 4-Quality education, 11-Sustainable cities and communities, 13-Climate action) are also worthy of review and analyze when considering BGs. They could meet the needs of both the local and global communities and are effective in shaping the future and promoting the 2030 goals. In this context, paying attention to the UN's global and inclusive call, this paper focuses on Eden Project, United Kingdom, Ecorium of National Institute of Ecology, South Korea and Konya Tropical Botanical Garden, Turkey. Missions of the projects rely on conservation, restoration, education and community engagement. They address several global concerns, including climate and biodiversity emergency. Aim of this paper is to investigate to what extent the selected BGs can contribute to the SDGs. Results underline BGs as a valuable input in decision making and policy action concerning environmental justice, equity, and inclusion that encourage transformative steps in achieving the SDGs.",Not About Sufficiency
The circular economy approach towards integrated and intensive rabbit farming,"Rabbit farming had significant potential for advancing sustainable agricultural development in Indonesia, particularly in improving farmers’ welfare, increasing access to food, and enhancing soil fertility in agricultural lands. Integrating with agriculture led to increased land productivity and enhanced farmer welfare. The economic value of rabbits drove this potential, the availability of feed, and the suitability of the climate, which collectively contributed to efforts in food security. This study explored the application of the linear economy model in an integrated and intensive rabbit farming system managed by a forest community group in Kemutug Lor Village, Banyumas District. The research was conducted using a case study method, with data collected and analysed using a mixed-method approach, combining phenomenological and quantitative methods. Implementing circular economy principles into rabbit farming, integrated with home food gardening, showed positive economic and environmental impacts. Economically, the rabbit farming activities demonstrated an RC ratio greater than one, providing an additional source of income for farming households. Environmentally, this integration contributed to reducing environmental impacts by minimising the direct disposal of waste that could cause pollution and decreasing reliance on chemical fertilisers, indirectly enhancing the environment.",Not About Sufficiency
"Agriculture, food security, and climate change in South Asia: a new perspective on sustainable development","The South Asian region has faced multiple challenges in the last few decades. This region is susceptible to climate change due to the presence of both drought-prone and coastal areas. It also faces the problem of increasing food-insecurity due to the recent events of crop failure consequent to natural calamities. This study examines the nexus between agricultural production and food security amidst climate change for the South Asian nations from 2000 to 2019. From the empirical investigation, using Driscoll-Kraay and Panel-Corrected Standard Error estimators, we get robust results in the presence of cross-sectional dependence and heteroskedasticity. The simultaneous equation model using 3SLS is also used for the robustness check, considering the probable endogeneity issue in the model. The findings of the study reveal that agricultural production, fertilizer consumption, and land under cereal production play a substantial and positive role in determining food security in the South Asian nations. Furthermore, the varying rainfall patterns coupled with rising temperature, as well as the increasing level of CO2 emissions are found to impede food security in these nations. Additionally, non-climatic factors related to agriculture and land-use are also found to induce CO2 emissions, which is a major cause of climate change. Therefore, from a policy perspective, this study suggests that to ensure long-term food security in the South Asian nations, the government should implement effective policy measures, which include the decarbonization of the agricultural sector by encouraging the use of renewable energy sources and promoting climate-resilient agricultural practices.",Not About Sufficiency
Operationalizing the net-negative carbon economy,"The remaining carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will probably be exhausted within this decade1,2. Carbon debt3 generated thereafter will need to be compensated by net-negative emissions4. However, economic policy instruments to guarantee potentially very costly net carbon dioxide removal (CDR) have not yet been devised. Here we propose intertemporal instruments to provide the basis for widely applied carbon taxes and emission trading systems to finance a net-negative carbon economy5. We investigate an idealized market approach to incentivize the repayment of previously accrued carbon debt by establishing the responsibility of emitters for the net removal of carbon dioxide through 'carbon removal obligations' (CROs). Inherent risks, such as the risk of default by carbon debtors, are addressed by pricing atmospheric CO2 storage through interest on carbon debt. In contrast to the prevailing literature on emission pathways, we find that interest payments for CROs induce substantially more-ambitious near-term decarbonization that is complemented by earlier and less-aggressive deployment of CDR. We conclude that CROs will need to become an integral part of the global climate policy mix if we are to ensure the viability of ambitious climate targets and an equitable distribution of mitigation efforts across generations.",Not About Sufficiency

Assessing the role of sustainable strategies in alleviating energy poverty: an environmental sustainability paradigm,"The rapid urbanization and industrialization of India have caused a demand–supply gap in the electrical sector, leading to higher electric bills. Lower-income households face the worst energy poverty in the country. Sustainable strategies like corporate social responsibility are the most effective way to combat the energy crisis. This study aims to assess the contribution of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to energy poverty alleviation (EPA) by developing the role of mediating variables such as assessment of renewable energy resource (RER), feasibility of sustainable energy supply (SES), and sustainable energy development (SED). We used hybrid research methodology such as partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the collected data from professionals, economic experts, and directors in the country in 2022. The study proved that CSR directly affects energy poverty alleviation. Besides, the findings suggest RER, SES, and SED significantly lead the energy poverty alleviation. The findings of this study will divert the attention of policymakers, stakeholders, and economists toward the corporate social responsibility to mitigate the energy crisis in Indian context. A mediating role of a renewable energy resource (RER) as a value-added contribution to this study can be strengthened more in future research. Based on the results, the study illustrates that CSR acts as a catalyst to alleviate energy poverty.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating environmental justice under the National Environmental Policy Act,"'Environmental justice' refers to the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws. Fair treatment means that minority and low-income groups should not bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental impacts of government actions. Recent studies have shown that, in the United States, some government decisions have adversely affected low-income and minority communities disproportionately to the rest of society. To avoid such inequities in future federal activities, President Clinton issued Executive Order (EO) 12898, which requires federal agencies to consider environmental justice in carrying out their missions. Guidance issued by the Executive Office of the President requires every federal agency to consider environmental justice in conducting impact evaluations under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Thus, an 'environmental justice analysis' is a highly focused form of social impact assessment that must be conducted within the framework of NEPA. The specific purpose of such an analysis is to determine whether a proposed federal activity would impact low-income and minority populations to a greater extent than it would impact a community's general population.

Net flow of wealth from South (less developed) to North (more developed) nations has exacerbated a spiral of increased poverty and environmental degradation in the former. Global environmental conservation depends upon a radical change of direction with the principle of equity as the starting point. Notwithstanding the importance of continuing to add to local and small-scale conservation achievements, the prospect of radical change happening seems small, despite it being in the long-term self-interest of the North.

Africa’s Energy Availability-Deficiency Paradox: Lessons from Small-scale Biogas Technology and Policy Implications,"The energy crisis associated with energy poverty in Africa continues to keep millions of men, women and children in absolute poverty due to inadequate access to clean energy. Despite its widely recognised importance for sustainable development, theoretical and policy discourses have largely remained dormant with respect to the role that the paradox of energy deficiency plays in the underdevelopment of Africa. This study illustrates how the exploitation of energy potential can be tailored to exert a positive impact on household livelihoods and sustainable development in Africa. Specifically, this study was aimed at determining the impact of biogas technology on the livelihood of beneficiaries and estimating the environmental benefits of biogas technology in terms of global warming potential in order to provide policy recommendations. The results show that the beneficiaries’ livelihood assets, including the human, physical, financial and social capital, were positively impacted by the use of biogas technology. The dominant impact of biogas technology was financial, as the beneficiaries witnessed a significant increase in their household incomes. This was possible through the reduction of the expenditure on fuelwood and the sale of digestate. The environmental benefits of disseminating biogas technology as a cleaner energy source were significant, providing evidence that mobilising the biogas potential in Africa would lead to significant decarbonisation of household energy supply. This shows that integrating the livelihood enhancement components in energy interventions amid the enormous unexploited energy potential would contribute to the sustainable transformation of the African continent. In resonance with Agenda 2030, we conclude by contributing to repositioning energy availability, affordability, and reliability as critical components of an energy revolution for sustainable development in Africa.",Not About Sufficiency
Balancing sustainability and circular justice: The challenge of the energy transition,"The shift to renewable energy is no longer an option but a critical need for addressing climate change. Nevertheless, it frequently culminates in exacerbating existing socioeconomic disparities, disproportionately affecting already vulnerable communities. This study examines the intersection of the circular economy (CE), the energy transition, and justice concerns through a literature review of 169 publications. By employing a comprehensive approach to analyse the environmental and social implications of renewable energy generation, distribution, and waste treatment, it advocates for circular justice as a framework to mitigate the disparities that arise from such a shift. The findings emphasise the necessity of an inclusive strategy that incorporates distributive, procedural, and recognitional justice into circular energy practices. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of developing evaluation tools that balance sustainability with social equity, thereby promoting a decarbonised future that is equitable for all, globally inclusive, and resilient. Policymakers and industry leaders should advocate for social frameworks that guarantee equitable participation and outcomes, moving beyond an exclusive focus on resource efficiency. Looking ahead, future research should concentrate on advancing technologies that support sustainable, inclusive energy transitions on a global scale.

Advancing Environmental Sustainability in Healthcare: Review on Perspectives from Health Institutions,"Hospitals play a key role in promoting sustainable and healthy living. Few studies have taken this perspective into account. Therefore, we explored the role of hospital institutions in the development and implementation of sustainability strategies linked to the provision of health services. Applying the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of the PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases and the references of the resulting articles in Mendeley Desktop v1.19.8. Articles peer-reviewed between 2016 and 2023 were eligible if they analyzed sustainable healthcare, activities derived from services provided and professional involvement. From the 27 articles that constituted the final sample, two themes were identified: (a) environmental sustainability in healthcare and (b) involvement of healthcare professionals in environmental sustainability. Proposals for sustainable actions to reduce the environmental impact of healthcare related to the use of natural resources, sustainable food, sustainable transport and waste management were reviewed. The role of healthcare workers, their attitudes and perceptions of sustainability and global health improvement were investigated. Reducing health pollution involves addressing excessive or inappropriate consumption of resources and minimizing the environmental footprint of healthcare activities. The different contexts reveal the heterogeneity of the sustainability interventions existing in the healthcare industry, both in terms of subject matter and in terms of the number of publications from each country.",Not About Sufficiency
"Automation and Its Influence on Sustainable Development: Economic, Social, and Environmental Dimensions","This study investigates the complex duality of automation and its impact on sustainable development, encompassing the factors of economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability. Innovations in artificial intelligence, robotics, and machine learning are driving automation and transforming industries through improved production, operational efficiency, and resource optimization. However, the rapid integration of automation has created a paradox. While it offers opportunities for resource optimization and technological advancement, it exacerbates challenges such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and social displacement. These issues underline the need for balanced and inclusive approaches to automation's implementation. Automation contributes substantively to GDP growth because it raises labor productivity, yet it has arguably enhanced income inequality by eliminating low-skilled jobs. Automation improves energy efficiency and aids in renewable energy integration but increases overall energy effectiveness, leading to concerns regarding ecological sustainability. This study applied a quantitative methodology using longitudinal data from 2000 to 2023 and regression models to examine sustainability metrics influenced by automation. The findings highlight the potential of automation to reform effective forms of manufacturing, encourage environmental innovation, and identify the need for systemic governmental policies. Specifically, the results indicate that automation has contributed to a 25% increase in labor productivity across sectors, a 15% reduction in energy intensity per unit of GDP, and a 12% rise in the Gini index, signaling growing income inequality. These quantitative outcomes emphasize both the opportunities and challenges posed by automation. By integrating technological advancements with sustainability goals, automation can act as a transformative instrument to promote ecological conservation, equitable economic development, and social justice. The paper concludes with recommendations for governments and industry leaders to incorporate automation into sustainable development objectives, ensuring the equitable distribution of its advantages, while alleviating socio-environmental hazards.",Not About Sufficiency

Assessing the environmental sustainability and justice dimensions of nuclear electricity under circular economy and energy transition frameworks,"This study is framed within the international political context that shows on one side the risks of nuclear plants of being under attack in conflicts among countries (e.g., the present war between Russia and Ukraine) and on the other side the decarbonization policies of many countries including EU members, focused on equalizing nuclear and renewable sources for the generation of electricity. A systematic literature review is adopted, with the goal of understanding if nuclear electricity is environmentally sustainable as well as environmental and socially just in circular economy (CE) and energy transitions. According to some scenarios based on a higher role of nuclear electricity, results suggest the need to take into account the increase of ionizing radiations, Uranium depletion and water consumption. The impact of nuclear is also higher when compared with renewables (e.g. wind) in terms of total material requirement and, again, water consumption. LCA studies included in this review also highlight the impacts of the nuclear fuel cycle and in particular the Uranium stage as well as the decommissioning stage where the impacts of open cycles versus partially closed or totally closed cycles are compared. The analysis of the sample assessment of environmental and justice dimensions in the nuclear fuel cycle show that the selected articles focus on the whole life cycle of nuclear electricity and three main stages such as Uranium mining, decommissioning operations and identification of sites for spent nuclear fuel disposal. The integration of justice dimensions in the study resulted important in improving the understanding of the impacts of the nuclear fuel cycle on local communities in mining regions, or those who live near nuclear power plants or disposal facilities. The challenges of LCA in assessing the impacts of nuclear energy have been analysed suggesting the strong need for considering further impact categories and more comprehensive frameworks when evaluating its sustainability and role in decarbonization scenarios.

Integrated Energy Storage Systems for Enhanced Grid Efficiency: A Comprehensive Review of Technologies and Applications,"The rapid global shift toward renewable energy necessitates innovative solutions to address the intermittency and variability of solar and wind power. This study presents a comprehensive review and framework for deploying Integrated Energy Storage Systems (IESSs) to enhance grid efficiency and stability. By leveraging a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework, this study synthesizes techno-economic optimization, lifecycle emissions, and policy frameworks to evaluate storage technologies such as lithium-ion batteries, pumped hydro storage, and vanadium flow batteries. The framework prioritizes hybrid storage systems (e.g., battery–supercapacitor configurations), demonstrating 15% higher grid stability in high-renewable penetration scenarios, and validates findings through global case studies, including the Hornsdale Power Reserve (90–95% round-trip efficiency) and Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (15,000+ cycles for flow batteries). Regionally tailored strategies, such as Kenya’s fast-track licensing and Germany’s H2Global auctions, reduce deployment timelines by 30–40%, while equity-focused policies like India’s SAUBHAGYA scheme cut energy poverty by 25%. This study emphasizes circular economy principles, advocating for mandates like the EU’s 70% lithium recovery target to reduce raw material costs by 40%. Despite reliance on static cost projections and evolving regulatory landscapes, the MCDA framework’s dynamic adaptation mechanisms, including sensitivity analysis for carbon taxes (USD 100/ton CO2-eq boosts hydrogen viability by 25%), ensure scalability across diverse grids.

The environmental policy perspective of the total, direct and indirect effects of EF on SDGs estimated through path analysis unveils that the existing mode of achieving SDGs is at the cost of environmental degradation. SDGs have shown improvement through the improvement in the level of HDI, where human development is being attained in an environmentally unsustainable manner. The paper establishes that SDGs achieved are ecologically unjustifiable, and a reorientation of the existing patterns of human development well within the limits of ecological capacity of the earth is to be targeted.",Not About Sufficiency
Application of Transition Engineering Methodology to Energy Efficiency Development in the Brewery Company,"Most companies aimed at long-term sustainable development take full responsibility to reduce the environmental risks in order to guarantee environmental safety and social justice of the planet's population. In accordance with circular economy principles, energy efficiency and energy saving are currently among the most important strategic directions for technological development of many enterprises. For transition to ""low carbon"" development scenario, companies are setting priorities and goals, taking into account the concept of sustainable development, considering the energy consumption index or energy usage ratio as one of the key business indicators. An analysis of existing methods and approaches in companies' energy management show a low level of strategic planning and management. To improve energy efficiency and implementation of energy policy, as well as to create conditions for company's sustainable development in long term, it is necessary to apply innovative management methods. Such approaches as transition engineering and participatory backcasting will allow companies to determine the main directions of strategic business development in the field of energy efficiency. The need to improve methodological approaches to managing the energy sector of the enterprise's economy determines the relevance of the chosen research topic. The aim of this paper is to present the results of CREA-RE-RU project, which deals with circular economy and resource efficiency development. The project investigated following key points: existing methods and approaches for managing energy resources of an enterprise; a review of innovation management methods for improving the energy efficiency of companies; application of the ""transition engineering"" approach to the formation of the company's energy development strategy; the results of application of the ""transition engineering"" approach for developing an energy efficiency strategy for the brewery company.",Not About Sufficiency
"Agricultural policy, climate change and food security in Mexico","This paper describes how variations in agricultural policy and climatic conditions have influenced maize production and food security in 20th-century Mexico. We describe the Mexican food system today and how economic policy has influenced food output in efforts to attain food security based on the goal of national self-sufficiency. We examine the impact of climate variability on agricultural production; the ways in which agricultural policy has interacted with climate to change vulnerability to environmental and social change and the implications of global warming for the future of Mexican agriculture. Finally, we discuss the implications of the changing economic environment as Mexico has opened its economy - for example, through the North American Free Trade Agreement. Our goal is to provide a context for thinking about the implications of two types of global change for Mexico - the internationalization of economies and the widespread transformation of the environment. © 1994.",Not About Sufficiency

CHAPTER 5 CLIMATE MITIGATION PLANNING,"Urban planning solutions to address climate change must consider the form of settlement structures (mixed-use, compact communities) and the pattern of settlement expansion (reductions in sprawl, densification through infill development, transit-oriented development), as well as alternative energy systems (upgrading to more energy efficient systems, cogeneration of heat and power, district heating and cooling, microgrid technologies, and renewable energy systems).[...]in 2016, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) extended its GHG emissions reduction targets by enacting SB 32, which requires GHG emissions reductions of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 (Shields 2021).[...]most decisions about urban form are made at the local level-by public officials, practitioners, and residents in cities, counties, metropolitan organizations, and special districts.Because urban planners are largely responsible for shaping the built environment at the local level, they are in a unique position to advance solutions to address challenges related to climate change.Effective mitigation strategies a community can implement include the following: * Increasing the use of renewable energy and access to alternative fuels * Providing options for active transportation * Designing energy-efficient buildings and resilient infrastructure * Protecting and enhancing natural systems and water resources * Maximizing co-benefits of ecosystem services and green infrastructure solutions * Purchasing climate-friendly products * Educating the public on socioeconomic and public health impacts of climate change Including a climate change element within a comprehensive plan provides a framework for integrating and addressing the economic, environmental, and social factors of climate change.",Not About Sufficiency
The Inequalities- Environment Nexus: TOWARDS A PEOPLE-CENTRED GREEN TRANSITION,"As countries are confronting the COVID-19 global health emergency and its economic and social ramifications, they are also racing against the clock to avoid an environmental emergency. The pandemic has exposed systemic inequalities from the past, with its impacts hardest felt among disadvantaged groups. At the same time, environmental challenges such as climate change, biodiversity collapse and air pollution continue to pose great systemic risks to the wellbeing of current and future generations. The COVID-19 crisis has amplified the urgency of addressing societal challenges together with strong and concerted action on climate and other environmental crises. Recovery efforts to 'build back better' must be both green and people-centred, and consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This paper examines the inequalities-environment nexus building on the multi-dimensional lens of the OECD Well-being Framework. It analyses the impacts of the environmental degradation and of environmental policies on different dimensions of people's well-being. The four key well-being dimensions considered are health, income and wealth, work and job quality, safety. The OECD Framework for Policy Action on Inclusive Growth and the Green Growth Policy Frameworks are used to identify policy responses that could sustain and share the benefits of green growth more equitably. The analysis shows that the impacts of environmental degradation are concentrated among vulnerable groups and households. Lower baseline health, limited access to good quality healthcare, and lower ability to invest in defensive measures (e.g. air filtration and better housing quality) increase the vulnerability of lower socio-economic households to air pollution and climate change. Furthermore, the young and the old are often more affected. Evidence points to long-run effects of exposure to air pollution on child educational outcomes, especially for children from low-income households. Heatwaves, which are likely to become more frequent with climate change, represent a real risk for older people's well-being. Similarly, the fallout from air pollution and climate change affects the livelihoods of low earners and workers in certain sectors. More frequent heat waves and extreme weather events are likely to affect outdoor workers more, who are often low earners. Moreover, several studies also highlight the negative impact of outdoor air pollution on low-skilled indoor workers. At the same, growing evidence on the negative impacts of air pollution on cognitive capabilities suggests that it represents a risk to the productivity of highly-skilled workers. The impact of climate change on the productivity of several sectors that are crucial to rural economies (e.g. agriculture, fisheries) may contribute to exacerbate the urban-rural divide. The benefits and costs of environmental policies are also likely to be unevenly distributed across households. Overall, vulnerable groups may have a considerable stake in the success of green polices as direct beneficiaries since they bear a disproportionate share of the health costs of air pollution and climate change. While carbon pricing is a central component of green policies, affordability concerns need to be taken into account as higher energy costs may put greater burden on low-income households and compromise their well-being. Similarly, if segments of the elderly population are required to limit energy consumption for heating and cooling, their health and well-being may be put at risk. Moreover, higher taxes on road transport fuels may affect rural residents more than urban dwellers, since the former tend to rely more on private cars and have limited acces to viable public transport alternatives. At the same time, households that are owner-occupiers may benefit more from environmental policy measures that increase home and land values than home-renters, such as subsidies for improving the energy efficiency improvements or creation of green areas. Even if small on aggregate terms, green policies can have important distributional implications for jobs at the sectoral or regional levels. On the one hand, if ambitious policies to curb climate change and air pollution were to be introduced, employment levels in carbon-intensive heavy industries and fossil fuels extractive activities are expected to fall. On the other, green industries are anticipated to be a source of job creation, such as in renewable energy generation. Job reallocation across sectors can also have gender and regional implications. Some of the most negatively affected industries (e.g. extractives and heavy industries) have a male-dominated workforce, which gives a rationale for considering gender-sensitive transition policies in certain regions. At the same time, the current low female participation in STEMrelated fields of education and particular barriers to female entrepreneurship may constrain women's participation in the renewable energy sector, an area that is expected to expand considerably in the green transition. Furthermore, regional economies heavily reliant on carbon-intensive sectors or fossil fuel extraction may face severe challenges in their structural adjustment and diversification process. This paper considers that an integrated policy approach could be structured in four pillars, including measures to: 1. Mitigate the possible regressive impact of pricing environmental externalities for vulnerable households. Well-designed revenue recycling schemes to accompany such price-based measures and transfer payment could be instrumental to this end. 2. Achieve inclusive green growth with investment in human capital, through active labour market policies, well-targeted income support measures, and upgrading skills to facilitate labour reallocation. Measures to support the geographic mobility of workers at risk of losing their jobs in shrinking industries would be important, as well as reforms to improve access to affordable housing. 3. Address systemic inequalities with sectoral and place-based policies that facilitate social dialogue, social capital investments, social protection, skills and education investments to ease structural adjustment of local economies. Geographically blind climate change and air pollution control measures can result in rising discontent among local communities if the benefits and costs of environmental policies are dispersed geographically. Importantly, policy packages for a just green transition should vary from one region to another, as no ""one-size-fits-all"" green pathway is possible. 4. Ensure efficient and responsive governance to manage the inclusive green transition. As policies in different domains (e.g. housing, transport) interact with each other across the economy, long-term strategies can help to strengthen coherency in favour of their alignment across different ministerial portfolios. Institutional mechanisms can support the mainstreaming of environmental and equity considerations in policy-making and budgeting across ministries and levels of government. Clear and regular entry points in the policy-making process for the civil society would also help to enhance public acceptance of ambitious green policies. Monitoring consistently the outcomes of policies on economic, societal and environmental dimensions of a just transition is necessary to deliver on their objectives. To achieve this, the measurement framework needs to capture whether the people-centred green recovery is well-targeted, efficient and effective. To this end, data and indicators that capture the intersectionality of environmental and social challenges are needed such as more accurate and timely information on how different demographic groups, workers and territories are affected by the environmental degradation. Furthermore, there is a need for a better understanding of the types, incidence and extent of social impacts of the lowcarbon transition. In addition, in light of existing climate risk disclosure standards for companies, more effort is also needed to align public approaches with private-sector approaches to measurement from a perspective of a ""double-materiality"" approach - a combined focus on both financial materiality and social and environmental materiality. To move the measurement agenda forward, further OECD work is needed along these dimensions, particularly in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.",Not About Sufficiency
Public Policies for Renewable Energy: A Review of the Perspectives for a Circular Economy,"The development and implementation of public policies towards renewable energies are crucial in order to address the contemporary challenges faced by humanity. The 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle), as a circular economic practice, are often cited as one of the best solutions for sustainable development. Therefore, this study analyzed public policies for renewable energy from the perspective of the circular economy. Accordingly, a systematic review of the literature was carried out with respect to the beneficiaries and convergences of circularities, with a focus on public policies for renewable energies. The sample had public policies classified into three types (distributive, redistributive, and regulatory policies). The results showed that the first studies began in 1999, with a significant increase in publications during the 2010s, in which Germany was the country with the greatest contribution. The analyses associated with space showed the countries committed to the use of renewable energies and the 3Rs of the circular economy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The economic analyses revealed that the circular economy for the generation of renewable energy has a positive economic return in terms of social well-being and the mitigation of environmental degradation. There is a barrier to the circular economy’s development posed by the cost of its implementation in the private sector and the resistance to raising awareness in society, requiring strong public sector engagement in decision making and the constant evaluation of public policies. It is concluded that the circular economy facilitates more efficient, productive structures and public policies, promoting alternatives for energy security and sustainability for the world energy matrix.",Not About Sufficiency
ROLE OF ELECTRICITY GENERATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE LONG-TERM ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY OF INDIA,"Electricity distribution has become one of the most essential components of our society since the beginning of human civilization, relying on an abundant, reliable, and affordable power supply. Fossil fuels dominate the production of electricity (89.57 %), emitting 68.7 % of greenhouse gases, polluting water and soil, and depleting fossil fuels. Future energy needs are faced with growing demand for coal (772 million tonnes by 2040) and fluctuating fuel prices. The Indian power sector withdraws over 20 billion m3 of water, whereby coal power plants use around 35 % of freshwater. Among the seventeen sustainable development goals, Goal 7 emphasizes meeting the demand for electricity, the availability of clean fuels, and mitigating air pollution. In 2021, about 747 TWh of energy consumption was met by coal, oil (92 TWh), and solar energy (25 TWh). Renewable power would meet the world's growing energy needs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, boost the economy, and strengthen the society. Therefore, renewable energy has gained global attention as a sustainable electricity source. For this, a thorough examination of the economic and social implications of electricity generation technologies must be carried out. This study discusses how fossil fuel-based electricity generation affects global health and the environment and helps achieve Goal 7 of the sustainable development goals. All sectors must work together to stop global warming and water war and make electricity available worldwide for integrated development.",Not About Sufficiency

Redefining Hospital Accessibility: A Service Design Framework for Inclusive Healthcare,"In the framework of becoming a carbon neutral city by 2030, Bologna faces challenges related to enhancing the quality and accessibility of its built environment to improve the quality of life and well-being of its residents. The IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Sant’Orsola Polyclinic is a key agent of change within this initiative. The hospital has initiated a comprehensive renovation project aligned with its commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3, which addresses Good Health and Well-being, and SDG 10, which addresses Reduce Inequalities. To address these goals, the hospital has engaged a research team from the University of Bologna to apply Service Design methodologies. The research aims to reshape accessibility and user experience systematically and sustainably, adhering to the principles of Design for All. The study maps diverse user groups, analyses circulation paths, and identifies physical and procedural barriers affecting vulnerable individuals, especially those with disabilities. The research introduces a novel approach by developing a comprehensive strategy rather than isolated solutions, focusing on interconnected accessibility services across pavilions. Dedicated hubs within each pavilion facilitate resource and support device exchange, improving users’ experiences.

The project is now entering a testing phase, during which the solution will be refined based on user feedback.",Not About Sufficiency
Inequality repercussions of financing negative emissions,"Negative emissions technologies are attracting the interest of investors in the race to make them effective and profitable. When deployed at scale, they will be financed through public funds, reducing the fiscal space for a socially inclusive climate transition. Moreover, if the private sector owns negative emissions technologies, potentially large profits would disproportionally benefit investors and equity holders. Here we quantify the inequality repercussions of direct air capture of CO2 in a 1.5 °C scenario, using a regional integrated assessment model that features within-country income heterogeneity. We find that, under a single carbon market, financing negative emissions technologies could double the increase in income inequality of climate policy. The effects are highest around the time of net zero and in scenarios with carbon budget overshoot. We identify the drivers of the inequality increase and discuss policy provisions to mitigate the equity concerns of CO2 removal strategies.Negative emissions technologies at scale are seen as essential for the overall decarbonization effort to achieve the Paris Agreement targets. However, private ownership of these technologies could largely increase regional or international inequality by financing them through carbon markets.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustaining business as usual or enabling transformation? A discourse analysis of climate change mitigation policy in Swedish municipalities,"This article explores how discourses may influence the potential for success in mitigating climate change in Swedish municipalities. We identify dominant discourses in climate change mitigation policy in three Swedish municipalities using argumentative discourse analysis, based on policy documents and interviews as empirical material. Political leadership and adequate organizational preconditions are necessary for working with climate change mitigation in municipalities, but the role of discourse is also significant. Policy discourse constructs preconditions for certain scenarios while rendering others less likely. Previous studies have shown that the ecological modernization (EM) discourse tends to be dominant, something which this study confirms and investigates further. We find that the dominant discourse is strong EM, which largely considers it possible to decouple economic growth and environmental problems through renewable energy and technology. A focus on collaboration between stakeholders is central and a global climate justice perspective is present to some extent. Potential solutions that are not related to the market or technological innovation risk being rendered invisible when this discourse is dominant, but the inclusion of a diversity of actors and an increased focus on climate justice could potentially minimize this risk. Finally, emerging discourses around transformation and circular economy have potential to enable the forging of new paths. This depends, however, on how these concepts are framed and how they are used.",Not About Sufficiency
Government failure - the cause of global environmental mismanagement,"This paper argues that although pollution may move across national boundaries and polluters are mobile, governments should be able to coordinate a sound management of the environment through transfer payments or commitments. However, governments may respond to political pressure rather than maximize social welfare. Because pollution tends to hurt large unorganized groups, future generations, and those who are uninformed, there is likely to be a 'government failure' resulting in too little protection of the environment. Government failure in one country may also reduce the desirable level of cleaning in other countries. Brief analyses of atmospheric emissions, the destruction of the tropical rainforest, consumption of tobacco, and the development and diffusion of new technology by multinational corporations, further suggest that government failure is a major cause of environmental mismanagement. It is advocated that an international body should be instituted to compensate for this. © 1991.",Not About Sufficiency

"Analysis of Research on the SDGs: The Relationship between Climate Change, Poverty and Inequality","Since its adoption in September 2015, the 2030 Agenda has laid the foundations for a model of shared prosperity for a sustainable world. The current global pandemic highlights profound inequalities affecting our economies, health, and quality of life. For this reason, the aim of this study was to present the current state of scientific research related to inequality, poverty, and climate change, and to propose lines of improvement that can contribute to achieving three of the 17 SDGs (end poverty, SDG 1; reduce inequality, SDG 10; and climate action, SDG 13), proposed in the 2030 Agenda. For this purpose, we undertook a systematic literature review. The results show that the subject of poverty, inequality, and climate change has been little studied or articulated by researchers, and significant differences exist between the different areas studied. The highest number of publications (51.7%) is associated with topics related to sustainability-environment and economics. The remainder are distributed among 12 other research areas. Another relevant finding is that the effects of climate change are more pressing for more vulnerable populations, including impoverished women from rural areas and children from underdeveloped countries. This gender and social inequality has been rarely addressed in studies. Food security and energy poverty is another under-researched area. According to the results obtained in this work, we consider that the circular economy may improve these indicators, constituting a line of future research. Thus, one of the main objectives of this approach is to eliminate negative externalities, specifically the existing social inequalities within the current linear economy model.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysing regulatory instruments in sustainability transitions: A combined 'intervention points' and 'roles of law' approach to the European Union's Ecodesign framework,"The challenges of operating within the planet's carrying capacity call for an urgent transition towards sustainable consumption and production (Sustainable Development Goal 12). Despite the growing literature on sustainability transitions policies, the role of regulatory instruments has received limited attention. We conduct a qualitative content analysis and combine theoretical approaches on intervention points and the roles of law to study how regulatory instruments affect the transitions. The combined approach is applied to the European Union's Ecodesign Directive and two product groups regulated under this framework, washing machines and lighting. The results shed light on two transition processes: the evolution of product design towards energy efficiency and then towards circularity. Ecodesign has so far steered and accelerated the transition towards energy efficiency with harmonised minimum requirements and bans as the regulatory spearhead. The requirements have stimulated and accelerated niches and destabilised the unsustainable incumbent regime in product design. Yet, the requirements' long processes, narrowing assumptions on future developments and difficulties in managing the broader effects have also held the transition back. The recent introduction of circularity-related requirements aims at destabilising the prevailing linear regime, even at shifting the broader landscape of production and consumption. However, the transition towards the circular economy is decelerated by the ensuing, complicated trade-offs and broader repercussions that are difficult to anticipate. The paper thus shows how the role of regulatory instruments in transitions is considerably more complicated than is generally realised. We conclude that the combined analytical approach is useful for better understanding the nuances and intricacies in sustainability transitions. The study highlights how the governance of sustainability transitions towards a more circular economy with regulatory instruments must be comprehensive yet granular: the policymakers need to carefully and systematically consider the steering, accelerating as well as braking roles for all points of intervention.",Not About Sufficiency
An Evaluation of the Alignment of Surplus Food Recovery and Redistribution Technologies with the Circular Economy,"In Qatar, food security is a top research priority. The National Food Security Strategy (2018-2023) and the Qatar National Vision 2030 show evidence of policy support regarding food security. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (S.D.G.) 12.3 frames the basis of food waste reduction efforts. Our study aims to provide basic information for innovative mobile application development that addressed food insecurity and waste in Qatar. Furthermore, we discuss how such a technology and the proposed features align with the circular economy concept. The circular economy aims to prolong the useful life of materials and products to maximize resource value and reduce waste. In addition, we highlight the main potential benefits that various stakeholders in the Qatar economy could derive from the innovative surplus food recovery mobile application. The scope of this work is necessary given the diverse nature of the stakeholders involved in the surplus food recovery and redistribution industry. The innovation demonstrated significant solutions to many problems, and using them in the food sector could provide optimal solutions to manage/reduce food surplus waste and loss. The suggested platform differs from the existing food services application, as it closes the food circle and achieves the sustainable goals for a better environment and society for future generations.

"An Equality-Based Approach to Analysing the Global Food System's Fair Share, Overshoot, and Responsibility for Exceeding the Climate Change Planetary Boundary","The climate catastrophe is being caused by human effects on earth system processes that are surpassing several planetary boundaries. This crisis is driven significantly by the global food system. It has been increasing over recent years, yet food systems are essential in upholding food and nutrition security. This study proposed a novel method for enumerating national contributions to the cessation of the climate crisis by approximating nations' aggregate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from food systems, within the equitable and sustainable planetary boundaries of climate change. This study included 221 nations, which were grouped as per their human development index (HDI) categories, income groups, and continental locations. During 1990-2018, the annual fair share, overshoot of emissions, and collective historical responsibility in the world of each country were assessed. There was a 22.52% increase in overshooting of GHG emissions from the global food system, starting in 1990. A group of 15 countries, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, and the U.S.A., were responsible for >67% of global overshoot. The primary liability is borne by countries with upper-, middle-, and high-income economies, and high to very-high HDI groups, as well as Asia and South America. Countries such as India, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and others have steadily increased their share of responsibility over the last 28 years. More than 76% of countries in the world, mostly from Africa, Europe, and Asia, proved to be absolute overshooters. After contextualising the study's findings, the global food system's decarbonization and its limits were discussed; some recommendations for prospective research were also offered. It appears that academics, governments, and policymakers should start concentrating more on reshaping and redesigning the global food system to be climate-friendly (i.e., a carbon-neutral food system), whilst being able to fairly allocate food and nutrition security to achieve long-term Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2).",Not About Sufficiency
An Ecohealth approach to energy justice: Evidence from Malawi?s energy transition from biomass to electrification,"Decarbonisation is essential to limiting the electricity sector's contributions to CO2 emissions. Simultaneously, there is recognition of the need to increase electricity access in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, such as in Malawi, with renewable energies suggested as capable of meeting these needs. However, the drive for low carbon electrification, especially in settings where biomass use for cooking is widespread, may act as a driver of new and intersecting injustices. The energy justice framework is well posited to recognise injustices which emerge across energy supply chains, though existing analysis has typically focused on single energy systems. In order to capture injustices emerging in settings of dual biomass use and hydroelectricity generation, it is necessary to consider how energy systems impact on both human health (e.g. air pollution from biomass burning) and the functionality of ecosystems (through deforestation and resulting siltation of rivers). Thus, we argue for an Ecohealth approach to energy justice research, drawing on evidence from Malawi's transition towards electrification.",Not About Sufficiency

Classical Biological Control and Social Equity,"For over a century, scientists from industrialized countries as well as from developing countries have appropriated natural enemies from different regions of the world. These actions have been conducted thus far without compensation to the donor countries for such ‘biological services’. This unrecompensed extraction has been predicated on the basis that biodiversity (including natural enemies) are ‘humankind's common heritage’ (Kloppenburg & Kleinman, 1987). Such a view has been challenged by some social scientists as well as representatives from some developing countries who now question the inequity of global patterns of exchange of and access to plant genetic resources. At issue is the substantial ‘genetic debt’ that the industrialized countries have procured from developing countries and which has remained uncompensated (Fowler & Mooney, 1990). In fact, the agricultures of industrialized countries are characterized by extreme dependence on ‘introduced’ genetic materials from developing countries. Much of this germplasm has been utilized by seed companies from industrialized countries to develop new, high-yielding varieties, often sold back to developing countries at considerable profit. The contradiction in the status of developing countries crop genetic resources as freely available ‘common heritage’ and the status of seed companies’ commercial varieties as ‘private property’ available by purchase has fueled a major geopolitical controversy. This dispute is bound to expand to other activities involving interregional exchange of biological resources. Concern about global environmental changes, the levels of responsibility of industrialized and developing countries in relation to these changes, and the fact that many developing countries are major repositories of biodiversity which play major biospheric roles, are all issues that fuel the controversy. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

"Automation and Its Influence on Sustainable Development: Economic, Social, and Environmental Dimensions","This study investigates the complex duality of automation and its impact on sustainable development, encompassing the factors of economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability. Innovations in artificial intelligence, robotics, and machine learning are driving automation and transforming industries through improved production, operational efficiency, and resource optimization. However, the rapid integration of automation has created a paradox. While it offers opportunities for resource optimization and technological advancement, it exacerbates challenges such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and social displacement. These issues underline the need for balanced and inclusive approaches to automation’s implementation. Automation contributes substantively to GDP growth because it raises labor productivity, yet it has arguably enhanced income inequality by eliminating low-skilled jobs. Automation improves energy efficiency and aids in renewable energy integration but increases overall energy effectiveness, leading to concerns regarding ecological sustainability. This study applied a quantitative methodology using longitudinal data from 2000 to 2023 and regression models to examine sustainability metrics influenced by automation. The findings highlight the potential of automation to reform effective forms of manufacturing, encourage environmental innovation, and identify the need for systemic governmental policies. Specifically, the results indicate that automation has contributed to a 25% increase in labor productivity across sectors, a 15% reduction in energy intensity per unit of GDP, and a 12% rise in the Gini index, signaling growing income inequality. These quantitative outcomes emphasize both the opportunities and challenges posed by automation. By integrating technological advancements with sustainability goals, automation can act as a transformative instrument to promote ecological conservation, equitable economic development, and social justice. The paper concludes with recommendations for governments and industry leaders to incorporate automation into sustainable development objectives, ensuring the equitable distribution of its advantages, while alleviating socio-environmental hazards.",Not About Sufficiency
Aligning Climate Change and Sustainable Development Goals With an Innovation Systems Roadmap for Renewable Power,"Energy development improves quality of life for humans, but also incurs environmental consequences. A global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy may mitigate climate change but may also undermine the capacity to achieve some or all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this study, we use an innovation systems approach to construct a comprehensive roadmap for solar and wind energy to anticipate and improve impacts of a transition to a low carbon future in a manner ensuring climate goals and SDGs are mutually reinforcing. Our multidisciplinary approach began with an assessment of public investments in renewable energy followed by a 2-day research prioritization workshop. Fifty-eight expert workshop participants identified six research themes that proactively address the environmental sustainability of renewable energy. Next, we identified linkages between the six research themes and all 17 SDGs. Finally, we conducted a scientiometric analysis to analyze the research maturity of these themes. The results of these efforts elucidated the limits of existing knowledge of renewable energy-SDG interactions, informing the development of a research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RD3) roadmap to a renewable energy future aligned with both climate goals and SDGs. The RD3 roadmap has been designed to systematically develop solutions for diverse actors and organizations. Overall, our findings confer a broad vision for a sustainable transition to renewables to minimize unintended environmental consequences while supporting interoperability among actors particularly poised to influence its magnitude and direction.",Not About Sufficiency
The socio-economic impact of rising sea levels,"In recent years, a rapid sea level rise (SLT) caused by global warming, has been predicted. Such a rise in sea level would have a great impact on human life in coastal regions all over the world. In order to implement measures to counteract an SLR, a detailed preliminary assessment of its impact is required. This paper reports on such an assessment. Our research project is divided into two states, FY (financial year) 1990 to 1992, and FY 1993 to 1995. This report describes the key results of the first stage of the project. In the first stage, we mainly focused on developing a method for quantifying the effects of an SLR, using a combination of information on ground elevations, landuse and socio-economic statistics. We quantified effects for Kumamoto (Japan) and Bangkok (Thailand) in FY 1990 and 1991, and for Nobi (Japan) and Bangpakong (Thailand) in FY 1992. This paper first outlines the framework of the study, then reports the results of each study area, and finally lists the problems of the study and conclusions. -from Authors",Not About Sufficiency
"An analysis of LULC changes for understanding the impact of anthropogenic activities on food security: a case study of Dudhganga watershed, India","Although the Dudhganga watershed is the primary water and food resource of the Kashmir Valley, it has undergone significant changes in food resources and strategies due to rampant urbanization in the area over the past 20 years. This urbanization has had a profound impact on the watershed and has also affected land use and land cover (LULC) patterns and environmental changes. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of urban development on food security parameters in the Dudhganga watershed area, India, from 2000 to 2020, by evaluating LULC changes. Additionally, the study aims to examine the relationship between climate changes and LULC indices, such as the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). The results indicate a 21.66% increase in barren areas, at the expense of snow-covered lands, during the 2000–2020 period. The primary land cover transition observed is towards barren areas. The predictions for LULC in 2030 highlight the need for careful management of land use and climate changes in the study area. This study can assist local government officials in reassessing food strategies by identifying areas where urban expansion should be controlled and climate impacts minimized, to prevent local hunger and ecological degradation. Therefore, the development of systematic urban planning approaches and mitigation of climate change sources are crucial. Furthermore, the adoption of advanced agricultural technology should be considered to mitigate the impact of urban expansion.",Not About Sufficiency
"Agriculture in Brazil: impacts, costs, and opportunities for a sustainable future","Brazil has developed a large-scale commercial agricultural system, recognized worldwide for its role in domestic economic growth and expanding exports. However, the success of this sector has been associated with widespread destruction of Brazilian ecosystems, especially the Cerrado and the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, as well as environmental degradation. Brazil's agricultural development has also led to land consolidation, aggravating a historical land distribution inequality. This pattern of agricultural growth has reinforced Brazil' status as one of the world's most inequitable countries in terms of income distribution, making it difficult to assert that the nation is pursuing a sustainable development path. In order to achieve sustainable development Brazil must reconcile its increasingly productive, modern tropical agricultural system with environmental preservation, social equity, and poverty alleviation in rural and urban areas. Although a daunting task, Brazil has the opportunity to lead tropical countries in combining modernized agriculture with highly diverse and functional ecosystems. Continued improvement in socioeconomic conditions is equally important and will require stronger efforts to decrease inequalities in income and land distribution in the rural sector.",Not About Sufficiency
Agricultural ecosystems and their services: the vanguard of sustainability?,"Sustainable Development Goals offer an opportunity to improve human well-being while conserving natural resources. Ecosystem services highlight human well-being benefits ecosystems, including agricultural ecosystems, provides. Whereas agricultural systems produce the majority of our food, they drive significant environmental degradation. This tension between development and environmental conservation objectives is not an immutable outcome as agricultural systems are simultaneously dependents, and providers of ecosystem services. Recognizing this duality allows integration of environmental and development objectives and leverages agricultural ecosystem services for achieving sustainability targets. We propose a framework to operationalize ecosystem services and resilience-based interventions in agricultural landscapes and call for renewed efforts to apply resilience-based approaches to landscape management challenges and for refocusing ecosystem service research on human wellbeing outcomes.",Not About Sufficiency
Agricultural Development and Land Use Change in India: A Scenario Analysis of Trade-Offs Between UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"India has the second largest population in the world and is characterized by a broad diversity in climate, topography, flora, fauna, land use, and socioeconomic conditions. To help ensure food security in the future, agricultural systems will have to respond to global change drivers such as population growth, changing dietary habits, and climate change. However, alterations of how food is produced in the future may conflict with other UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as the protection of land resources and climate change mitigation. It is crucial for decision-makers to understand potential trade-offs between these goals to find a balance of human needs and environmental impacts. In this paper, we analyze pathways of agricultural productivity, land use, and land-cover changes in India until 2030 and their impacts on terrestrial biodiversity and carbon storage. The results show that in order to meet future food production demands, agricultural lands are likely to expand, and existing farmlands need to be intensified. However, both processes will result in biodiversity losses. At the same time, the projections reveal carbon stock increases due to intensification processes and decreases due to conversions of natural land into agriculture. On balance, we find that carbon stocks increase with the scenarios of future agricultural productivity as modeled here. In conclusion, we regard further agricultural intensification as a crucial element to help ensure food security and to slow down the expansion of cropland and pasture. At the same time, policies are required to implement this intensification in a way that minimizes biodiversity losses.",Not About Sufficiency
"Ageism, welfare, and the energy transition: a comparative analysis of the perceptions among the elderly in Poland and Norway","Background One of the potential dimensions on which exclusion and injustice may occur in energy transitions is age. Age-based patterns of exclusion-ageism-has recently been conceptualized in the context of decarbonization as energy ageism. This paper offers a comparative empirical analysis of the senior citizens' outlook towards an imminent energy transition as well as the impact of energy poverty in two European countries: Norway and Poland.Results Drawing on interviews and focus groups with Polish and Norwegian seniors, we present the differences and similarities between the two countries, and the determinants of energy ageism, as well as the concept's overall applicability and empirical usefulness. We find that socioeconomic conditions outweigh ageism, that is, the resilience of senior citizens in dealing with energy poverty during a transition is conditioned by their material standing and welfare state robustness rather than age based. An important factor is household heating technology, combined with economic vulnerability can push some individuals into energy poverty, while others using alternative sources of heat can navigate through energy crises unscathed.Conclusions We note the importance of mainstreaming social inclusion considerations in energy policy and of targeted digital competence building which can enhance senior citizen integration in the energy transition. Lower levels of digital competences among senior citizens certainly play a role and need to be addressed with education programs to increase participation. In both countries, household heating is a major issue and heating sources are strong predictors of energy poverty and regulatory measures and subsidies should be designed at national, regional, and municipal level to assist vulnerable groups in this area.",Not About Sufficiency
Evaluating the Impact of Participatory Community Radio on SDGs 15 through a Quasi-Experimental Approach,"The Niger Delta, a region in southern Nigeria that includes the states of Delta, Bayelsa, and Rivers, is experiencing significant environmental degradation caused by factors such as oil spills, deforestation, and habitat destruction. Given the severity of these issues, it is crucial to identify effective strategies for promoting sustainable land management and conservation in the area. One such strategy is the use of community radio. Despite community radio's potential, there is limited research on its effectiveness in addressing environmental issues like deforestation and biodiversity loss in the Niger Delta, specifically regarding its impact on SDG 15, which aims to protect ecosystems, manage forests, combat desertification, protect biodiversity, and integrate ecosystem values. This study investigated the impact of participatory community radio interventions on Sustainable Development Goal 15 in the Niger Delta. The study adopted a quasi-experimental research approach. A matched sample of 338 participants (169=control and 169= experimental groups) underwent a two-phase investigation, which revealed significant changes in knowledge, attitude, and behaviour linked to environmental issues following the intervention (i.e., exposure to participatory community radio programme). The study confirmed a favourable shift in sustainability outcomes among groups exposed to participatory community radio projects. Furthermore, the study highlighted the complex interplay between attitudes, community or team discussions, and long-term sustainable behaviour, offering insight into the significance of collective engagement in developing environmental practices. Key recommendations include diversifying communication channels and tailoring interventions to meet the distinct needs of various demographic groups.",Not About Sufficiency
Advancing Sustainable Bio-Waste Management through Law and Policy: How Co-Creation Can Help Pursue Fair Environmental Public Policies in the European Context,"Alongside production and consumption, bio-waste management is central to the food systems debate. To achieve sustainable food systems-an essential component of the Sustainable Development Goals and the world they envision-public authorities must address the shortage of current bio-waste-management policies and strive towards a new paradigm of bio-waste management, where environmental justice primarily informs policy design and decision making. In order to achieve fair environmental policies, particularly in the context of food systems and bio-waste management, it is essential to understand what drives public policy in these matters. In the present review, we seek to contribute by closing a gap in the literature by proposing a set of bio-waste-management drivers in the European context. Moreover, we focus on the ""policy and legislation"" driver, hoping to examine its main components and understand both their limitations and the opportunities they provide. Finally, we explore the role that co-creation can play as a facilitator of a public-governance paradigm that promotes sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Advancing bipartisan decarbonization policies: lessons from state-level successes and failures,"U.S. political polarization is at a high point since the Civil War, and is a significant barrier to coordinated national action addressing climate change. To examine where common ground may exist, here we comprehensively review and characterize successes and failures of recent state-level decarbonization legislation, focusing especially on bipartisanship. We analyze 418 major state-government-enacted bills and 450 failed bills from 2015 to 2020, as well as the political contexts in which they were passed or defeated. We use bivariate analyses and regressions to explore correlations and partial correlations between the policy characteristics and political contexts of bills, and their passage or failure, their bipartisanship, and vote shares they received. Key results include (i) nearly one-third of these state-level decarbonization bills were passed by Republican-controlled governments. (ii) Bipartisan or Republican co-sponsors disproportionately passed financial incentives for renewable energy, and legislation that expands consumer or business choices in context of decarbonization goals; Democrat-only co-sponsors disproportionately passed bills that restricted consumer and business choice, such as mandatory Renewable Energy and Efficiency Portfolio Standards (REEPS) and emissions standards. (iii) Bipartisan bills were disproportionately proposed in ""divided"" states, did not restrict consumer and business choice, had environmental justice components framed economically, and lacked environmental justice components framed either using academic social-justice jargon or non-neutrally with respect to immutable characteristics such as race. (iv) Bills that expand consumer or business choice were disproportionately enacted.

Role of Urban Metabolism Assessments in Addressing Food Security through Urban Agriculture in Informal Settlements: A Critical Review,"This literature review explores the role of urban metabolism (UM) assessments in addressing food security through urban agriculture in informal settlements, particularly in lower-income countries. It addresses the challenges of food security in urban areas and aims to unravel existing urban dynamics and networks to generate agro-food resources in these settings. The review included a comprehensive search using the Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) databases to identify relevant studies. A total of 381 articles published between 2000 and 2023 were retrieved. Additionally, a systematic review of grey literature was performed using Google Scholar, focusing on publications in the Spanish language from the years 2000 to 2023 to address food security dynamics in Latin America as a key case study area. After screening titles, keywords, and abstracts, 127 journal articles from the Scopus and WOS databases and 51 results from the grey literature were considered for further analysis. Bibliometric coupling techniques, including co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and keyword analysis, were employed using VOSviewer software to visualize the scholarly landscape and identify major themes. The analysis of white literature facilitated the identification of six major themes: (1) UM and Sustainability; (2) Phosphorus Management and Recycling; (3) Food Security and Waste Management; (4) Material Flow Analysis and Environmental Impact; (5) Human Impacts on the Environment; and (6) Food Systems and Sustainability. The main findings pointed to the environmental and social sustainability impacts of food flows in UM studies, emphasizing the pertinence of UM as a conceptual framework to address urban sustainability and justice challenges, particularly in informal settlements. Additionally, the grey literature provided insights into community strategies, urban resilience, and social inequality, enriching the understanding of local realities and socio-economic dimensions related to UM and food security in informal settlements. The review showed that by incorporating UM approaches and circular economy strategies, it is possible to optimize flows and stocks within the agro-food systems, leading to improved food security, sustainable development, and enhanced resilience in urban environments.",Not About Sufficiency

Accounting and Accountability in the Transition to Zero-Carbon Energy for Climate Change: A Systematic Literature Review,"This study investigates the body of literature on decarbonization management practices that use renewable resources and green technologies to meet zero-carbon energy targets for achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 to 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts'. Starting with the ongoing discussion surrounding the development of an information architecture to support effective decision-making in decarbonization processes, this study explores the role of accounting models in measuring and reporting decarbonization effects and accountability models that ensure that firms track progress, take responsibility for their environmental and social impacts and address challenges. These models guide resource allocation and adoption of green technologies to meet sustainability targets. A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to clarify how scholars have addressed issues regarding zero-carbon energy for mitigating climate change through accounting and accountability models. SLR was performed on 319 English articles published in the Scopus database and Google Scholar between 1990 and 2024. The results highlight that firms face extensive pressure from stakeholders and regulatory bodies regarding the legitimacy and transparency of decarbonization practices to meet zero-carbon energy requirements. The content analysis results revealed that sustainability reporting is useful for firms in rethinking decarbonization initiatives and linking them to the achievement of zero-carbon energy goals. Accounting and accountability models that embrace green technologies and renewable resources have increased institutional and stakeholder acceptance. This study is the first to examine how accounting and accountability systems can play a key role in firms through integrated thinking, which moves from integrated zero-carbon reporting to zero-carbon energy and the adoption of green technologies in decarbonization processes. This approach allowed us to discover accounting and accountability models through sustainable thinking for integrated accountability reporting during the twin transition process.",Not About Sufficiency
Access to Justice and Sustainable Development - How Can Environmental Access Rights Achieve Sustainable Development for All?,"Today's vast range of environmental crises represents an alarming reality for citizens from rich or poor countries. Worldwide social inequalities are widening because of the increasing environmental pressure put on the fragile ecological equilibrium of our planet. The fact that the planetary boundaries have to be respected is now known as well as the necessity to fully endorse the concept of sustainable development. Sustainability is key to overcome the challenges of our time, but can only be achieved with the involvement of the whole society. In that regard, giving citizens the right tools to this achievement is crucial and delivering environmental justice is essential. Environmental access rights represent these tools and have the potential to place the global agenda on a sustainable trajectory, as demonstrated by various examples around the world.

The Role of Eco-Industrial Parks in Promoting Circular Economy in Russia: A Life Cycle Approach,"As an approach to move towards a sustainable waste management system, circular economy (CE) is gaining an increased interest by most countries. Russia is among the countries where the CE is one of the priorities of the country’s economy, with a market value of the CE is USD$ 755.05 billion. However, such a strategy is facing challenges and barriers which are country specific. This study aimed to review the status of the CE in Russia and to identify the obstacles that are hindering the country from achieving its objectives. Moreover, the study aimed to evaluate the role of eco-industrial parks (EIP) in Russia in promoting the CE model. The study findings indicate that the CE adoption in Russia is still in its early stages. To create an enabling environment for CE promotion in Russia, there is a need to overcome several institutional, technical, and social barriers. Russian higher educational institutions are playing a major role to create the critical mass of experts that will help the country transition towards a CE model. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) to analyze the environmental performance of one of the EIPs in Russia revealed that such enterprises are more sustainable than the business-as-usual scenarios, under which the generated solid waste is buried into landfill. The comparison shows that by diverting 1.813 million tons of mixed municipal solid waste that is generated in Moscow to EIP would lead to a reduction in environmental impacts. The total global warming potential of the EIP scenario is less, by 59%, than the direct landfilling scenario, while the eutrophication, acidification, smog, and ozone depletion are less, and fossil fuel depletion impacts under the second scenario are less, by 81%, 26%, 18%, and 81%, respectively. Furthermore, the health impacts including carcinogenic, non-carcinogenic, eco-toxicity were found to be 92%, 96%, and 96%, respectively, less than the baseline scenario.",Not About Sufficiency
Time to treat the climate and nature crisis as one indivisible global health emergency,"Damage to one subsystem can create feedback that damages another—for example, drought, wildfires, floods, and the other effects of rising global temperatures destroy plant life and lead to soil erosion and so inhibit carbon storage, which means more global warming.2 Climate change is set to overtake deforestation and other land-use change as the primary driver of nature loss.3 Nature has a remarkable power to restore.[...]deforested land can revert to forest through natural regeneration, and marine phytoplankton, which act as natural carbon stores, turn over 1 billion tonnes of photosynthesising biomass every 8 days.4 Indigenous land and sea management has a particularly important role in regeneration and continuing care of nature.5 Restoring one subsystem can help another—for example, replenishing soil could help remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere on a vast scale.6 But actions that may benefit one subsystem can harm another—for example, planting forests with one type of tree can remove carbon dioxide from the air but can damage the biodiversity that is fundamental to healthy ecosystems.7 Human health is damaged directly by both the climate crisis, as the journals have described in previous Comments,8,9 and by the nature crisis.10 This indivisible planetary crisis will have major effects on health as a result of the disruption of social and economic systems—shortages of land, shelter, food, and water, exacerbating poverty, which in turn will lead to mass migration and conflict.Communities are healthier if they have access to high-quality green spaces that help filter air pollution, reduce air and ground temperatures, and provide opportunities for physical activity.20 Connection with nature reduces stress, loneliness, and depression while promoting social interaction.21 These benefits are threatened by the continuing rise in urbanisation.22 Finally, the health impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss will be experienced unequally between and within countries, with the most vulnerable communities often bearing the highest burden.10 Linked to this, inequality is also arguably fuelling these environmental crises.[...]we call for WHO to make this declaration before or at the 77th World Health Assembly in May, 2024.",Not About Sufficiency
"Spatiotemporal analysis of landscape pattern and structure in the Greater Bay Area, China","Landscape fragmentation and structural changes are associated with spatial ecological and social processes. Landscape fragmentation modeling and land use distribution analysis provide a framework within which landscape pattern and structure can be studied and quantified. The Greater Bay Area (GBA) is one of the fastest growing urban agglomeration in China and due to the speedy socioeconomic development and urban expansion, the landscape became more diverse, fragmented, and complex in land use, structure, and shape. This study analyses the spatiotemporal variations in landscape pattern and structure in the Greater Bay Area based on the 40 years’ time-series remote sensing data (1980─2020), fragmentation modeling, and structure change analysis. We used the fragmentation analysis at category and patch level and analyzed the fragmentation over forest, cropland, and grassland. We further employed the economic model of spatial Lorenz Curve and Gini Index for estimating the distribution of land use land cover (LULC) categories and structure changes. The results indicated that the landscape pattern indices of Greater Bay Area as whole, and its eleven cities had an obvious variations and diversity during 1980 to 2020. However, the diffusion and coalescence processes in each city follow distinct patterns.

A well-being framework for impact evaluation: The case of the UK offshore wind industry,"Growing levels of energy consumption and concern over the environmental consequences of energy production are leading to an increased investment in renewable energy generation. Despite an important relationship between energy production, consumption and well-being, little attempt has been made to provide a holistic assessment of how renewable energy sectors can contribute to different aspects of human well-being. This paper develops an impact evaluation framework that can be used to capture societal-level impacts of change on primarily objective well-being and applies it to the case of the UK offshore wind industry. As such, the framework goes beyond the traditional view of economic, social and environmental impact assessment and evaluation capturing wider aspects of societal costs and benefits as well as sustainable development. The framework proves a useful tool for organising the available evidence and suggests a broadly positive impact of the UK offshore wind industry. While further testing and refinement of the framework is needed, it could be easily transferred for well-being assessment of other industries and interventions.",Not About Sufficiency

A social-ecological approach to support equitable land use decision-making,"Human-driven land use change can result in unequitable outcomes in the provision and appropriation of ecosystem services (ES). To better address equity-related effects of land use change in decision-making, analyses of land use and ES changes under different land use management alternatives should incorporate ecological and social information and take a disaggregated approach to ES analysis. Because such approaches are still scarce in the literature, we present a generalized social-ecological approach to support equitable land use decision-making (in terms of process and outcomes) and an example of its application to a case study in southwestern Ethiopia. We propose a six-step approach that combines scenario planning with equity-focused, disaggregated analyses of ES.

A review of Africa's transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy using circular economy principles,"The term ""circular economy"" has become more prevalent over the last decade, especially in the areas of sustainability, resource management and productivity. Globally, more national, public and private sector organizations are considering the concept in their daily operations. With growing concerns about the impacts of climate change, there are equally growing debates about curbing the impacts. One such debate is to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. This paper reviewed existing literature relevant to Africa's energy transition whether it is enabled and can be guided by the principles of a circular economy. Various journal articles and business studies published between 2009 and 2019 were reviewed using a Systematic Literature Review Process. The study found that Africa's energy demand is expected to increase significantly, and it will be driven by industrialization and population growth. Most of sub-Saharan Africa's energy supply comes from renewable energy sources, while countries such as Algeria, Nigeria, Morocco, South Africa and Egypt (the Big Five) are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels. The researchers concluded that a circular economy approach can enable greater renewable energy uptake and transitioning. To support and enable a sustainable energy transition, regional finance institutions such as the African Development Bank and governments, can continue to finance more scalable technologies and adopt 'intentional' regulations which are guided by circular principles and a just-transition. Although data pertaining to how the transition can be underpinned by circularity is limited, there is great opportunity for more scientific and industry research that can provide further contextualized support.",Not About Sufficiency
"A Place-based, Just Transition framework can guide industrial decarbonisation with a social licence","A growing policy focus in many economies is decarbonising energy-intensive industries such as steel, chemicals, and cement, responsible for a quarter of global CO2 emissions. While policy discourses underscore the need for rapid, cost-effective industrial decarbonization, how to implement decarbonization in ways that are fair and just to workers and local communities and build a social licence to operate remains unclear. This perspective addresses a gap in guiding how governments and industries decarbonise by collaborating with affected communities and workers. We propose a Place-based, Just Transition framework that synthesises findings from four UK research projects and three under-connected research fields - Sense of Place, Just Transition, and Social Licence to Operate. The framework highlights seven themes: ongoing processes; place sensitivity; genuine community engagement; localised benefits and fairness; trust, credibility and legitimacy; multi-level governance; and tradeoffs and tensions. Reflecting on our engagement with stakeholders in three UK industrial clusters, we identify four challenges impacting application of the framework: expectations, scope, resources, and leadership. We argue that negotiating these challenges and applying the framework can go beyond narrow technological and economic framings of industrial decarbonization and can guide place-sensitive and fair industrial decarbonisation with a social licence.",Not About Sufficiency
"A Minimally Nonanthropocentric Economics: What Is It, Is It Necessary, and Can It Avert the Biodiversity Crisis?","An important line of scholarship concludes that stemming the biodiversity crisis requires widespread nonanthropocentric modes of action and decision-making. In this regard, knowing what would even constitute a nonanthropocentric economic decision-making framework is hobbled by failing to recognize a conflation in the taxonomy of capital as supposed by traditional (anthropocentric) economics. We explain how natural capital (a basic category in anthropocentric economies) conflates natural capital without intrinsic value and natural capital with intrinsic value. Recognizing this conflation allowed us to identify instances of quantitative analyses that have elements of nonanthropocentrism but that seem not to have been previously recognized as such. We also explore inescapable consequences of recognizing this conflation, including the need to better understand how economic decision-making should take account for interspecies distributive justice and human well-being.

"A low GHG development pathway design framework for agriculture, forestry and land use","Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) represent 22% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

This paper proposes a pathway design framework for AFOLU decarbonisation strategies that can help governments set targets across four types of levers (increasing sequestration; improving the emissions efficiency of agriculture; incentivising dietary changes; and displacing fossil fuels with bioenergy) and help them navigate potential synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development objectives (notably food security, biodiversity preservation, poverty alleviation and job creation), in a way that facilitates co-construction and discussion with main stakeholders.",Not About Sufficiency
A holistic interdisciplinary approach towards environmental justice and youth empowerment,"South African youth is described as marginalised and vulnerable because of, amongst others, high unemployment rates, a lack of access to opportunities and environmental degradation that threatens their and future generations' well-being. Both social work and faith-based organisations place value on the empowerment of marginalised youth, as well as on the importance of participatory environmental initiatives. Practice guidelines to effectively empower youth in this regard are, however, lacking. This discussion was aimed at determining how environmental social work can take place in collaboration with faith-based organisations to contribute to both the empowerment of youth and environmental justice. A search of literature from 2010 onwards was conducted, focusing on the terms 'sustainable development', 'marginalised youth', 'environmental and/or green social work' and 'faith-based organisations'. Central themes were identified through a thematic analysis. Four central themes were identified for youth empowerment through an interdisciplinary approach to contribute to environmental justice, namely environmental responsibility, attitude, knowledge and concern. It was concluded that the potential of an interdisciplinary environmental approach may be based on collaboration and an openness to include a renewed change orientation where disciplines work together across boundaries in multiple spaces to support environmental change and youth empowerment simultaneously.

A good life for all within planetary boundaries,"Humanity faces the challenge of how to achieve a high quality of life for over 7 billion people without destabilizing critical planetary processes. Using indicators designed to measure a 'safe and just' development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2-6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial.",Not About Sufficiency
A globally just and inclusive transition? Questioning policy representations of the European Green Deal,"Climate change mitigation policies around the world are increasingly formulated as 'green deals' characterized by comprehensive packages of ('green') economic and societal reforms intended to bring about a just and inclusive transition to a low-carbon economy. This paper takes as its starting point what we see as a fundamental tension underlying the logic of these policies: despite making ambitious claims about the ethical merits of the transition they aim to bring about, their implementation depends on the extraction of massive amounts of raw materials. Most of these materials will be sourced from the Global South, where the negative ecological and social impacts will be felt. Empirically we explore how this tension is reflected in the European Green Deal, the most comprehensive of the green deal initiatives to date. Analyzing 195 policy documents from the European Union, we find that the role played by the European Green Deal in driving negative impacts beyond its borders is effectively silenced in official discourse. This enables the propagation of a narrative that justifies the dominant paradigm of green growth by portraying the European Green Deal as undertaking a globally 'just transition' that 'do no harm' and 'leaves no one behind'. However, it also results in discursive contradictions and inconsistencies that undermine the logic and legitimacy of the European Green Deal. These contradictions and inconsistencies, we argue, provide a possible entry point for efforts to improve the just and inclusive outcomes from the European Green Deal.",Not About Sufficiency

We used the annual 'British Petroleum statistical review of world energy 2021' report as our primary database. Globally, fossil fuels, renewable (primarily hydro, wind and solar), nuclear energy accounted for 83%, 12.6%, and 6.3% of the total energy consumption in 2020. To achieve zero fossil fuel use by 2050, we found that renewable energy production will need to be increased by up to 6-fold or 8-fold if energy demand is held constant at, or increased 50% from, the 2020 energy demand level. Constraining 2050 world energy demand to a 25% increase over the 2020 level, improves the probability of achieving independence from fossil fuels. Improvements in energy efficiency need to accelerate beyond the current rate of similar to 1.5% per year. Aggressive application of energy conservation policies involving land use and taxation could potentially reduce world energy use by 10% or more by 2050. Our meta-analysis shows that the minimum level of per capita energy consumption that would allow 8 billion people to have a 'Decent Living Standard' is on average similar to 70 GJ per capita per year, which is 93% of the 2020 global average. Developed countries in temperate climates with high vehicle-dependency needed similar to 120 GJ per capita year whereas equatorial countries with low vehicle-dependency needed 30 GJ per capita year(-1). Our meta-analyses indicated replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy by 2050 may be possible but will require aggressive application of all eight pathways, major lifestyle changes in developed countries, and close cooperation among all countries.",Not About Sufficiency
A framework for informing context-sensitive sustainable management of organic waste in rural agricultural regions,"Resource recovery can provide opportunities to mitigate the negative impacts of conventional organic waste management such as landfilling to the environment, economy, and society in rural agricultural regions. However, region-specific assessment of such opportunities can be challenging due to lack of data, limited economic resources, and inadequate policy support to meet community needs. Therefore, we developed a framework utilizing open-source data and methods informed by community engagement to assist stakeholders in rural agricultural regions in considering strategies to recover resources from organic waste. The framework was applied in Hardy County (one of the largest agricultural regions in rural West Virginia) to compare the sustainability of current management practices (landfilling of sewage sludge and organic municipal solid waste such as food and yard waste, land application of sewage sludge and poultry litter, and transportation of poultry litter out of watershed) with different anaerobic digestion scenarios. The results indicated that co-digesting alum-treated poultry litter with organic municipal solid waste and sewage sludge would result in the most sustainable organic waste management under stakeholder-preferred weighting of environmental (global warming and eutrophication potential), economic (annual worth), and social (potential to benefit vulnerable households) factors. Interestingly, the current management practices received the second-highest score. The results were further utilized to develop recommendations for relevant policies related to nutrient management and decarbonization. Overall, the framework can be a useful tool for rural agricultural regions to promote sustainable organic waste management.",Not About Sufficiency
A framework for a responsible circular economy,"The move towards a Circular Economy (CE) from the perspective of a 'just transition' necessitates an approach which deems stakeholder knowledge and agency as central. Under this paradigm the transition to a CE is conceived not as a technocratic challenge, but as a process of socioeconomic transformation grounded in prin-ciples of social and environmental justice. We suggest that Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), as an approach for considering the relation of science to wider society, in particular the constituent concepts of anticipation, inclusion, reflection, and responsiveness (Owen et al., 2013), presents itself as a lens through which we can embed considerations of justice within CE practices. In exploring these dimensions with a critical view to how the CE discourse has often failed to consider who will benefit from the transition to a CE, we present a framework for supporting the design of responsible CE practices. We argue that such a framework can provide a starting point for future refinement and enrichment of the decision context faced by the relevant groups in the course of the transition to a just CE.",Not About Sufficiency
"A critical review of the circular economy for lithium-ion batteries and photovoltaic modules - status, challenges, and opportunities","To meet net-zero emissions and cost targets for power production, recent analysis indicates that photovoltaic (PV) capacity in the United States could exceed 1 TW by 2050 alongside comparable levels of energy storage capacity, mostly from batteries. For comparison, the total U.S. utility-scale power capacity from all energy sources in 2020 was 1.2 TW, of which solar satisfied approximately 3%. With such massive scales of deployment, questions have arisen regarding issues of material supply for manufacturing, end-of-life management of technologies, environmental impacts across the life cycle, and economic costs to both individual consumers and society at large. A set of solutions to address these issues center on the development of a circular economy - shifting from a take-make-waste linear economic model to one that retains the value of materials and products as long as possible, recovering materials at end of life to recirculate back into the economy. With limited global experience, scholars and practitioners have begun to investigate circular economy pathways, focusing on applying novel technologies and analytical methods to fast-growing sectors like renewable energy. This critical review aims to synthesize the growing literature to identify key insights, gaps, and opportunities for research and implementation of a circular economy for two of the leading technologies that enable the transition to a renewable energy economy: solar PV and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). We apply state-of-the-science systematic literature review procedures to critically analyze over 3,000 publications on the circular economy of solar PV and LIBs, categorizing those that pass a series of objective screens in ways that can illuminate the current state of the art, highlight existing impediments to a circular economy, and recommend future technological and analytical research. We conclude that while neither PV nor LIB industries have reached a circular economy, they are both on a path towards increased circularity. Based on our assessment of the state of current literature and scientific understanding, we recommend research move beyond its prior emphasis on recycling technology development to more comprehensively investigate other CE strategies, more holistically consider economic, environmental and policy aspects of CE strategies, increase leveraging of digital information systems that can support acceleration towards a CE, and to continue to study CE-related aspects of LIB and PV markets.",Not About Sufficiency
"A conceptual merging of circular economy, degrowth and conviviality design approaches applied to renewable energy technology","This article explores design criteria for renewable energy (RE) technology that align with Circular Economy (CE) strategies, while considering social dimensions and enabling independence from the economic growth imperative. Technologies addressed are solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and lithium-ion batteries. A literature review of CE and Degrowth fields culminates in a 45 CE strategies framework being merged with two 'convivial technology' design tools, identified in Degrowth literature, creating a 'CE-Conviviality design tool'. This tool facilitates a CE-conviviality criteria comparison, finding weaknesses in CE design approaches; and four contributions from conviviality - power distribution, equity and autonomy; localization; relatedness; and sufficiency. These contributions are applied to RE technology and their circular systems; identifying RE designers' strategies for action to foster growth independence and social wellbeing. The article calls for balance between design for internationalized/industrial technology and localized, convivial technologies - and end-of-life systems. Designers can promote: technology distributed through open-source technology, adaptable to multiple contexts; 'relatedness' - bolstering social wellbeing; and low-tech and sufficiency-based business models - the ultimate balance to international/industrial supply chains. Long-term, designers can collaborate internationally/nationally with policy and supply chain stakeholders to design technology for 'local' production/maintenance in specific geographical areas (e.g. countries), according to locally available materials or expanding CE systems; reducing reliance on monopolistic international supply chains.",Not About Sufficiency

A complex systems framework for the sustainability doughnut,"Achieving sustainability is challenging as an environmental and socio-economic objective, and as a complex concept whose multiple components and their interactions need to be considered. We develop a statistical model to investigate relationships among and between the planetary boundaries and social foundations of the sustainability 'doughnut' model. We find over 35 direct and indirect, positive and negative, influences of varying magnitude among seven boundaries (biodiversity loss, climate change, ocean acidification, land use, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, atmospheric aerosol loading and freshwater use) and eleven foundations (energy, income, health, education, food, water, gender equality, resilience, jobs, voice and social equity). We observe that biodiversity loss is driven by other planetary boundaries (land-use change and freshwater use), but also a social foundation (jobs, measured as vulnerable employment). The planetary boundaries of freshwater use and land use are also related: freshwater use is higher in urban centres than in rural areas. The planetary boundary of climate change is also related to land use (the extent of agricultural lands), and the social foundation of income per capita (greater income, higher carbon dioxide emissions). We also find that several social foundations are themselves interrelated. For example gender equality (measured as female participation in the work force) is mainly predicted by vulnerable employment. Also, food deficit increases with poverty level, but is alleviated by access to clean water. Education (literacy rate) and social equity (social insurance) can both lift people out of poverty. These inter-relations suggest that both synergies and trade-offs exist between and within boundaries and foundations. We provide a new conceptual framework that moves us away from the doughnut approach towards one that can begin to address the complex interactions that sustainability scientists and policy makers face when trying to maintain multiple social foundations while not compromising any of the planetary boundaries. We illustrate several hypothesis-based relationships here, to suggest that everything is not related to everything else. It is possible to work out significant pathways within this complex system, which is necessary to implement policies.

"A circular economy within the planetary boundaries: Towards a resource based, systemic approach","Circular Economy (CE) is the buzzword of today, promising an economy able to prosper on limited resources by closing material cycles. However, there is no guarantee that simple strategies of material cycling, as propagated by the various definitions of this concept, will indeed lead to an economy able to manage the worlds resources, pollution and societal demand within environmentally sustainable levels. Based on the shortcomings of the present mainstream definitions of CE, this paper proposes an integrative, cascading, resource-based approach aimed at an environmentally sustainable and socially beneficial economy. The international community agrees on the necessity to maintain the current environmental equilibrium to ensure equity for future generations and to allow human well-being and dignity already in the present. Accordingly, physical and environmental limitations are identified, that are to be observed to make CE sustainable. This paper then suggests that a transition towards a sustainable resource-based CE goes hand in hand with a paradigm shift in the way environmental considerations are perceived by individuals, codified in different normative frameworks and dealt with by private companies. It therefore opens the discussion by underlying some challenges that could appear in the view of transitioning to CE.",Not About Sufficiency
A bibliographic review of the relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being,"Although the relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being (REH) has been widely recognized and has become an important basis for policy-making, a quantitative review of the relationship is still lacking. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of empirical studies focusing on the REH based on the PRISMA framework. Our review highlighted the progress and challenges in terms of conceptual frameworks, methods, and major themes. We found that there was no consensus on the classification systems for human well-being, and only 35% of the empirical studies applied one of these systems. More than half (53%) of empirical studies on REH were qualitative, and the participatory approaches were the most popular method. In terms of the types of ecosystem services and human well-being, provisioning services and basic material for a good life received the most attention with 191 (out of 482) and 57 (out of 131) mentions, respectively. Future research must be more clearly framed in terms of defining types of human well-being.

"A belowground perspective on the nexus between biodiversity change, climate change, and human well-being","Soil is central to the complex interplay among biodiversity, climate, and society. This paper examines the interconnectedness of soil biodiversity, climate change, and societal impacts, emphasizing the urgent need for integrated solutions. Human-induced biodiversity loss and climate change intensify environmental degradation, threatening human well-being. Soils, rich in biodiversity and vital for ecosystem function regulation, are highly vulnerable to these pressures, affecting nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and resilience. Soil also crucially regulates climate, influencing energy, water cycles, and carbon storage. Yet, climate change poses significant challenges to soil health and carbon dynamics, amplifying global warming. Integrated approaches are essential, including sustainable land management, policy interventions, technological innovations, and societal engagement. Practices like agroforestry and organic farming improve soil health and mitigate climate impacts. Effective policies and governance are crucial for promoting sustainable practices and soil conservation. Recent technologies aid in monitoring soil biodiversity and implementing sustainable land management. Societal engagement, through education and collective action, is vital for environmental stewardship. By prioritizing interdisciplinary research and addressing key frontiers, scientists can advance understanding of the soil biodiversity-climate change-society nexus, informing strategies for environmental sustainability and social equity.

2030 Agenda of sustainable transport: Can current progress lead towards carbon neutrality?,"The sustainable development goal of combating climate change highlights the importance of the transportation sector. This study analyzes the impact of eco-innovations in transportation along with traffic-TRF (road, rail, air), infrastructure development, green finances, trade globalization on demand, transport emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions from 1994 to 2020 in EU25 economies. Furthermore, the policy impact of innovation and taxes and renewables are estimated using their interactions. We employed second-generation approaches, PMG-ARDL, Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) and Granger causality. The results reveal that green transport neutralizes pollutant emissions, and traffic increases emissions by 17.5%, while green taxes limit them to 15.3% and 39.3% in the long and short run. Green taxes are a short-run tool; however, long-run sustainable targets depend on green transport, renewables, and R&D.

Cleaning Up Metal Contamination after Decades of Energy Production and Manufacturing: Reviewing the Value in Use of Biochars for a Sustainable Future,"The lasting impact of ancestral energy production operations and global manufacturing has not only generated substantial CO2 emissions, but it has also led to the release of metal-based pollutants into Earth’s water bodies. As we continue to engineer, mine (coal and metals), and now bore into geothermal wells/fracking sites for alternative energy sources, we continue to contaminate drinking water supplies with heavy metals through infiltration and diffusion, limiting progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals 3 (Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good health and well-being), 6 (Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation), 14 (Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life below water), and 15 (Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on land). This review shows how the research community has designed and developed mesoporous biochars with customizable pore systems, as well as functionalized biochars, to extract various heavy metals from water sources. This article investigates how biochar materials (non-activated, activated, functionalized, or hybrid structures) can be adapted to suit their purpose, highlighting their recyclability/regeneration and performance when remediating metal-based pollution in place of conventional activated carbons. By utilizing the wider circular economy, “waste-derived” carbonaceous materials will play a pivotal role in water purification for both the developed/developing world, where mining and heavy manufacturing generate the most substantial contribution to water pollution. This review encompasses a wide range of global activities that generate increased heavy metal contamination to water supplies, as well as elucidates emerging technologies that can augment environmental remediation activities, improving the quality of life and standard of living for all.",Not About Sufficiency

Economic Feasibility Analysis of Wind and Biomass-based Electricity Generation for Rural South Africa,"Rising human population and economic development have led to drastic increase in energy consumption. Currently, the largest portion of the energy demand across the world is met by continually depleting fossil fuels which also add to environmental pollution and global warming. This has intensified the quest for more sustainable and cleaner indigenous energy sources to reduce the high dependence on fossil fuels as well as to alleviate energy poverty in rural and remote localities, especially in continents like Asia, Africa and South America. This paper proposes implementation of wind and biomass-based energy generation systems for rural electrification as one viable option for energy poverty alleviation in the off-grid localities in the country. This paper assesses and compares the economic feasibility of electricity production from various wind and biomass based electricity generation systems, such as with and without storage and when wind and biomass are hybridized to form a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES).

"""Just"" ecopreneurs: re-conceptualising green transitions and entrepreneurship","Economic, environmental, and social limits of the current capitalist mode of production have led to a rethinking and reconceptualisation of economic processes and models including the role of businesses in sustainable development.

Nexus and synergy between the low-carbon economy and circular economy: A systematic and critical review,"The circular economy and low-carbon economy are closely interconnected as pillars of global sustainable development. However, no consensus exists on how to maximize the carbon reduction benefits of circular practices. This paper illustrates the nexus and identifies synergy paths between low-carbon actions and circular practices via a systematic and critical review. Results show that the mutual promotion relationship is the most studied in the existing literature (63.48%), followed by the parallel status (38.20%) and the trade-offs (3.37%). To enhance synergy mechanisms such as urban-industrial symbiosis and critical raw material cycles, challenges related to cost/risk reduction, urban/industrial planning and inter-system barriers should be addressed. Potential trade-offs arise mainly from carbon-intensive electricity, circular economy rebound and raw material scarcity, requiring a comprehensive consideration of the territorial energy supply structure and circular economy chains. Fiscal and informational interventions from the government, and the technological and business innovations they foster, are the shared drivers. Low-carbon actions and circular practices work together to serve the sustainable development of entities under various scales and dimensions. Three principles are proposed for decision-makers to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs: (1) prioritize non-end-of-life strategies to meet the surging de-mand for critical raw materials in the short term, (2) adjust the mix of circular practices following the pace of low-carbon energy transition, and (3) implement more bio-projects that contribute to a win-win situation for the transition to renewable energy and integrated bio-waste management. Briefly, circular practices reduce carbon emissions more effectively when tailored to local and immediate conditions. Future research should focus more on the time-varying features of different circular practices, factors behind household and individual behaviors, and social sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency

Agrivoltaics: Integration of Reused PV Modules,"This study evaluates the integration of reused PV modules within an agrivoltaic system designed for sustainable horticultural production, focusing on energy performance and agricultural outcomes. The experimental setup included both new and partially repaired PV modules, installed over tomato crops under real operating conditions. The results demonstrate that reused PV modules exhibit a strong and consistent energy performance, achieving correlations between irradiance and energy output comparable to new panels. Despite slightly lower performance ratios, reused modules maintained stable efficiency and operational viability, emphasizing their potential for sustainable applications. On the agricultural side, shading provided by PV panels protects the crop yield. This study highlights the environmental and economic advantages of incorporating reused PV modules into agrivoltaic systems, including reductions in raw material extraction, electronic waste generation, and overall environmental impact.

"Effect of the brown shrimp Crangon crangon L. on endobenthic macrofauna, meiofauna and meiofaunal grazing rates","The effect of natural densities (50 and 100 ind·m-2) of juvenile (<20 mm) Crangon crangon on abundance of endobenthic macrofauna and meiofauna and on meiofaunal grazing rates was investigated in two experiments using an outdoor flow-through system with sandy sediment. The experiments differed in duration (3 wk and 7.5 wk), and in time of the year (August - September and July - August). Macrofaunal biomass differed by a factor of 10 between the experiments, and was depressed by shrimp in both experiments. Neither total meiofaunal biomass, nor the biomass of the dominant taxon (nematodes), was significantly affected by the presence of Crangon in the shorter experiment. However, harpacticoid copepods and other meiofauna taxa (mainly ostracods, foraminiferans and juvenile bivalves) decreased in the presence of Crangon. In the longer experiment, no significant effect of Crangon on meiofauna was seen, and the biomass of most meiofaunal groups increased in all treatments. Meiofaunal grazing rates in microalgae and bacteria, measured with a dual-labelling method, using 14C-bicarbonate and [methyl-3]]-thymidine as tracers, were 0.7 to 4.7% of algal biomass per day, and 0.8 to 7.9% of bacterial biomass per day. Generally, grazing rates were lower in the presence than in the absence of Crangon. In terms of carbon ingested, microalgae constituted a more important food source than bacteria for all three meiofaunal groups (nematodes, harpacticoids and other meiofauna). No individual growth of Crangon was found in the high-density treatment in the longer experiment, suggesting that intraspecific competition occurred. The difference between the two experiments in the effect of Crangon on meiofauna is thought to be caused by the large difference in macrofaunal biomass between the experiments; the shrimp ate mainly juvenile macrofauna in the longer experiment. Overall, the effect of Crangon on the sediment system was weak, suggesting that other factors (physical and chemical) are more important than epibenthic predation in setting the overall limits for production in this sediment. © 1993.",Not About Sufficiency
No Sustainable Development in the Lack of Environmental Justice,"Environmental justice is defined in a broader sense as, ""The fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies."" In view of this definition, it is fair to say that no nation can achieve sustainable development if it lacks environmental justice. Sustainability or sustainable development is defined as, ""The development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs."" Accordingly, it is really difficult to maintain sustainable development without having environmental justice. The acts of many governments (particularly those of industrial countries) have, unfortunately, resulted in poisoning of communities and lands, and in genocides of peoples and the environment. As we are concerned here with the environmental status in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), it is important to focus on the injustices and oppressions practiced by the state of Israel and its successive governments, army, settlers, and industries against the environment in Palestine. This article sheds light on the issues of environmental justice (injustice) and sustainable (unsustainable) development in the OPT, in view of the Israeli violations of international law and international treaties, as well as the local and regional agreements related to the environment. Israel, since it occupied the Palestinian territories in June 1967, has committed what is believed to be racism and genocide against the environment and its constituents (land, soil, water, air, and biodiversity).

Nudging and boosting for equity? Towards a behavioural economics of energy justice,"With climate mitigation and energy transition impacts on vulnerable individuals becoming increasingly evident, justice considerations take on heightened relevance for energy governance. Yet, energy justice remains under-investigated in relation to the potential of behavioural economics. Behavioural economics provides evidence that individuals exhibit systematic and predictable patterns of decision-making that depart from the assumptions of rational choice theory, thus giving policy-makers a richer model of human behaviour. Adopting such a model will impact energy justice outcomes, hence understanding potential dynamics is timely. How can policy-makers complement traditional energy poverty alleviation measures with behaviourally informed ones to enhance vulnerable individuals' cognitive capacity? What implications does this carry for energy justice? Supportive choice architecture for individuals exposed to higher risks related to energy access and use must improve their outcomes, without shifting the responsibility for vulnerability to them, neglecting their intrinsic capabilities, or obscuring structural injustice. This article analytically illustrates whether and how behavioural economics can support individual behaviour and promote collective action, in combination with a policy shift to substantive claim-making processes, to address the unfair distribution of energy use burdens. Using nudging and boosting as tools for energy poverty alleviation, it discusses how behavioural economics can enhance energy justice.",Not About Sufficiency

This is because the primary resource (land) on which mining, and agriculture are based is scarce, and mineral deposits frequently coincide with land suitable for agriculture. Additionally, mining and agriculture both consume large amounts of water and are labour intensive. Thus, a direct link between the expansion of small-scale gold mining and its impact on smallholder agriculture has been established in various countries throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, though opinions vary on whether the relationship is complementary or competitive. Additionally, the impacts of these connections on food security have received relatively little attention, and they are heavily underrepresented in the literatures on small-scale mining and food security. This thesis closes this knowledge gap by shedding light on the impact of small-scale gold mining on food security and contributing to the debate over the relationship between small-scale gold mining and smallholder farming. I argue, using a mixed method case study in Ghana, that mining has a negative impact on food security and that women and children bear a disproportionate share of the burden. Additionally, I demonstrated how competitive and conflict-ridden the relationship between small-scale mining and smallholder farming is.This study was guided by a novel synthesis of the capability approach and a political ecology perspective. I begin by examining how structural and economic reforms have influenced mining and agricultural activities in Ghana over time, as well as the consequences of these reforms, with a particular emphasis on the often-overlooked ecological footprints. Second, I quantify and predict the pattern of land use and land cover change that would occur under various scenarios, as well as the factors that would cause these changes. Thirdly, I examine the factors affecting miners and smallholder farmers' access to critical resources (land, water, and labour), as well as the key actors in the mining and smallholder farming subsectors, as well as their power hierarchy and relationship. Finally, I examine the relationships between mining and smallholder farming and the state of individual food security (availability, access, utilisation, and stability).The key findings are as follows: first, that the promotion of export-oriented commodities such as gold and cash crops such as cocoa and oil palm at the expense of peasant farmers' food crops is associated with severe ecological impacts that remain shielded in the absence of required environmental legislation until they exacerbate. There are also flashpoints of conflict between mining and smallholder farming, which has been aggravated by recent reforms and lays the groundwork for future conflicts. Second, four distinct periods of land use and land cover dynamics for mining footprints were identified using a combination of social science and geospatial methods: periods of none to limited increase, gradual to accelerated increase, sharp increase, and gradual decrease in mining footprints. These land use and land cover dynamics were found to be associated with three major ecological impacts of mining: land degradation, deforestation, and water pollution. Over a 34-year period, a total of 27,333 ha (36% of forest cover) was lost, along with severe land degradation and water pollution. If mining activities continue at their current pace, the study predicts increased ecological impacts. Third, the previously coexisting mining and smallholder farming subsectors are now fiercely competing for access to critical resources (land, labour, and water), a situation shaped by unequal power relations between the two subsectors' key actors. Finally, small-scale gold mining significantly contributes to food insecurity and, as a result, to the poor health and well-being of many people, particularly women and children. Half of the study participants experienced moderate food insecurity, while 13% experienced severe food insecurity. Additionally, 79% of women of reproductive age (15 to 49) were unable to meet the Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD) requirements, a measure of micronutrient adequacy and, thus, food quality. Furthermore, local challenges with food availability, as well as associated challenges with food access and utilisation, erode food stability over time, forcing more people to adopt alternative coping strategies.The findings of this study provide novel empirical evidence on the impacts of small-scale gold mining on food security and highlight the importance of integrating mixed and geospatial methods. Additionally, the findings demonstrate the value of combining political ecology and capability approaches in natural resource governance and food security research.",Not About Sufficiency
"Of renewable energy, energy democracy, and sustainable development: A roadmap to accelerate the energy transition in developing countries","The world faces two pressing challenges: on the one hand, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C; on the other hand, enabling socio-economic development that is inclusive and equitable. These two challenges should not be seen as conflicting and should be addressed simultaneously. This is particularly true as we look forward to a post-COVID recovery efforts. The solution may partially rest on the transition to sustainable and renewable energy systems. The energy transition comprises presumptions of energy efficiency, affordability, reliability, and energy independence. And in developing countries, in particular, it also entails expectations of economic development, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. Since most of the remaining renewable energy potential lies in developing countries, these countries will play a crucial role. This paper reviews the status of the energy transition in the Global South, by surveying scientific and grey literature and synthesising the wide scope of alternatives available to accelerate and enhance the transition to renewable energy systems. The alternatives and approaches found are encapsulated in three dimensions: technology, society, and policy. A roadmap presents the potential synergies that could be established across dimensions and sectors to aid the energy transition in developing countries. Concisely, the transition can be achieved by adopting and implementing technologies already commercially-available that improve the efficiency, affordability, and reliability of energy systems, by redefining and reclaiming citizens' participation in energy planning and policy-making, and by democratically restructuring institutions and monitoring to boost transparency, accountability, and trust.",Not About Sufficiency
"Dynamics of land use and land cover changes in Huluka watershed of Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia","BackgroundLand use and land cover changes in urbanized watersheds of developing countries like Ethiopia are underpinned by the complex interaction of different actors, driving forces, and the land itself. Land conversion due to residential development, economic growth, and transportation is identified as the most serious environmental pressure on urbanized landscapes of the world. It results in the degradation of natural vegetation and significant increases in impervious surfaces. The purpose of the study was to analyze spatio-teporal changes in land use and land cover in the Huluka watershed with implications to sustainable development in the watershed.ResultsForest land, cultivated land, urban built-up, bush/shrub land, bare land, grassland, and water body were identified as the seven types of land use and land cover in the Huluka watershed. Forest land decreased by 59.3% at an average rate of 164.52 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Bush/ shrub land decreased by 68.2% at an average rate of 318.71 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Grassland decreased by 32.7% at an average rate of 228.65 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Water body decreased by 5.1% at an average rate of 1.06 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Urban built-up area increased by 351% at an average rate of 16.20 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Cultivated land increased by 105.3% at an average rate of 692.76 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Bare land increased by 41.9% at an average rate of 4.00 ha/year between 1979 and 2017. Infrastructural and agricultural expansion, increased demand for wood, local environmental and biophysical drivers, rapid human population growth, economic drivers, technological drivers, policy and institutional drivers, and local socio-cultural drivers were perceived by residents as drivers of land use and land cover changes. Increased flooding risk, increased soil erosion, increased sedimentation into water resources like lakes and rivers, decrease in soil fertility, loss of biodiversity, loss of springs, decrease in annual rainfall, and increase in heat during the dry season were perceived by residents as negative local effects of land use and land cover changes.ConclusionsChanges in land use and land cover in the study water shade imply the need for integrating sustainable watershed planning and management into natural resources management strategies. In other words, practices of appropriate land use planning and management, family planning, participatory planning and management, appropriate environmental impact assessment (EIA), and proper planning and management of development projects and programmes are of paramount importance to promote sustainable development in the Huluka watershed and beyond.",Not About Sufficiency
Social Aspects of Electric Vehicles Research—Trends and Relations to Sustainable Development Goals,"E-mobility sustainability assessment is becoming more comprehensive with research integrating social aspects without focusing only on technical, economic, and/or environmental perspectives. The transportation sector is indeed one of the leading and most challenging greenhouse gas polluters, and e-mobility is seen as one of the potential solutions; however, a social perspective must be further investigated to improve the perception of and acceptance of electric vehicles. This could consequently lead to the European Green Deal’s holy grail: faster decarbonization of the transportation sector. Another way to achieve it is by promoting more comprehensive sustainable development goals. Therefore, this paper combines a systematic review of recent research with research emphasis focused on social aspects of electric vehicles and their interconnection with specific UN Sustainable Development Goals. By knowing the current research focus mainly related with “perception” of electric vehicles and assessing their social “impact” as well as an emerging area of “user experience” and their relations with UN Sustainable Development Goals enables better insight on the current and future directions of electric vehicle social sustainability research. The current priority is identified as “climate actions”. Increasingly important “sustainable cities and communities” shows potential for becoming one of the future research, policy, and community priorities.",Not About Sufficiency
On energy for sustainable development in Nigeria,"The fuel driving the engine of growth and sustainable development of any nation is the nation's access to reliable and adequate energy. Access to energy is a crucial enabling condition for achieving sustainable development. Prudent energy policies and research can play an important role in steering both industrialized and developing countries onto more sustainable energy development paths. Specifically, they can strengthen the three pillars of sustainable development: the economy, by boosting productivity; social welfare, by improving living standards and enhancing safety and security; and the environment, by reducing indoor and outdoor pollution and remediating environmental degradation. Many factors that need to be considered and appropriately addressed in moving towards energy sustainability in Nigeria are examined in this article. These include full exploitation and promotion of renewable energy resources and application of energy conservation measures in various sectors such as manufacturing industrial set-up, office and residential buildings and transportation.

Economically efficient watershed management with environmental impact and income distribution goals,"This paper presents a methodology for incorporating environmental impacts and income distribution goals in economic analysis of watershed management policies. Empirical results on a small Illinois, USA, watershed indicate that farm costs are increased notably by restricting agricultural pollution and soil erosion. The income distribution constraint also reduces economic efficiency, but the efficiency loss due to implementing this constraint is less than 10% of the costs resulting from environmental regulations. An ex post comparison of these results with the actual payments offered to farmers under the incentive program currently in place in the watershed reveals that these payments are approximately equal to the losses estimated by the analysis when the burden of environmental control is shared equally among the farmers.",Not About Sufficiency
OPAL: An open-source software tool for integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services into impact assessment and mitigation decisions,"Governments and financial institutions increasingly require that environmental impact assessment and mitigation account for consequences to both biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here we present a new software tool, OPAL (Offset Portfolio Analyzer and Locator), which maps and quantifies the impacts of development on habitat and ecosystem services, and facilitates the selection of mitigation activities to offset losses. We demonstrate its application with an oil and gas extraction facility in Colombia. OPAL is the first tool to provide direct consideration of the distribution of ecosystem service benefits among people in a mitigation context. Previous biodiversity-focused efforts led to redistribution or loss of ecosystem services with environmental justice implications. Joint consideration of biodiversity and ecosystem services enables targeting of offsets to benefit both nature and society. OPAL reduces the time and technical expertise required for these analyses and has the flexibility to be used across a range of geographic and policy contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Operative System for Strategic Sustainable Development-Coordinating Analysis, Planning, Action, and Use of Supports Such as the Sustainable Development Goals, Planetary Boundaries, Circular Economy, and Science-Based Targets","The number of sustainability supports keeps growing. However, they are typically not capable of bridging planetary-to-organizational scales and therefore in themselves provide limited guidance for how organizations can contribute strategically to global sustainability. This is severe since the power of change that organizations represent is essential for humanity to succeed with the transition to sustainability. Furthermore, a specific sustainability support typically lacks a clear description of what gap it is designed to fill. This may add confusion to an already complex area and can result in organizations selecting supports that are not the most appropriate for the organization's purpose and transition plan. The aim of this study was therefore to prototype an approach for SWOT analyses of sustainability supports and for guiding effective and coordinated use of them. We tested the approach for some examples of supports that are currently receiving much attention: the sustainable development goals, planetary boundaries, circular economy, and science-based targets. We argue that the tested approach can be generalized and makes it possible to clarify limitations and value of any support from a systemic, systematic, and strategic sustainability perspective and, therefore, also to clarify how the supports relate to each other and can be selected and used in an effective and coordinated way. This is similar to how an operative system of, say, a smartphone, facilitates an effective and coordinated use of apps. We argue that the presented approach addresses one of the most dangerously, still most commonly, missed pieces in public and private discourses on sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimal carbon tax income distribution and health welfare spillover effect based on health factors,"Based on the Over Lapping Generation Model, this paper concerns the impact of environmental pollution and residents' health status on economic activities, and analyzes the relationship between tax revenue distribution proportion, economic activities and residents' social welfare. Through modeling, health welfare is introduced into welfare function, and time allocation proportion is introduced into health function and consumption budget. It is proved that the level of economic output and social welfare level can simultaneously optimal. Given the tax rate, we explore the optimal allocation ratio of carbon tax revenue when the per capita output of the economic steady-state equilibrium is optimal and the social welfare of the residents is optimal. Moreover, the evolutionary relationship among spillover effect, transfer payment, carbon tax, etc. is revealed. The stability analysis of qualitative conclusion is carried out and corresponding policies are put forward. It is proved that the optimal point of health welfare spillover effect exists. Then, under the steady-state equilibrium, in this paper the optimal effect of health welfare spillover is obtained.",Not About Sufficiency
Optimal decisions for competitive manufacturers under carbon tax and cap-and-trade policies,"With the gradual increasing of deepening of people's understanding of sustainable development, governments and enterprises have come to attach great importance to carbon emissions. Cap-and-trade (C&T) and carbon tax policies are widely regarded as two effective mechanisms for reducing carbon emissions. In this paper, considering consumer environmental awareness (CEA), we study the carbon emission reduction (CER) of two competitive manufacturers given the carbon tax and C&T policies. The two manufactures have two competitive behaviors: Cournot and Collusion. Four models are respectively constructed for different behaviors and policies, and the optimal decisions are obtained. Furthermore, comparison of the optimal solutions and parametric sensitivity analysis are discussed under two scenarios. The results indicate that the C&T policy is more sensitive to CEA than is the carbon tax policy. When manufacturers improve the efficiency of CER, compared with carbon tax policy, the C&T policy can more effectively curb carbon emissions, improve social welfare, and enhance the competitiveness of manufacturers. The fiercer CER competition leads to lower emissions and social welfare but higher total carbon emissions. The manufacturers' collusion behavior cannot make them achieve a win-win situation.",Not About Sufficiency
A health financing policy agenda for climate mitigation and adaptation,"The international community increasingly acknowledges the contribution of health systems to climate change and environmental degradation: globally, the health sector contributed approximately 5% to greenhouse gas emissions in 2019.1 This contribution is mainly due to energy-intensive production and transportation of supplies such as drugs, commodities and equipment, as well as energy consumption within health facilities and waste treatment.2 Conversely, climate change, pollution and related consequences, including psychological stress, also affect human health in numerous ways. Among others, higher temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns lead to prolonged droughts or floodings as well as higher transmission rates of vector-borne and waterborne diseases, increasing healthcare needs and often leading to increased out-of-pocket health expenditure.3 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2030, the additional direct costs for the health sector alone will be 2-4 billion United States dollars (US$) per year globally.2Climate change also has implications for health financing. The way health financing policies are designed can contribute to mitigation. Mitigation measures are actions that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - thus tackling the main cause of climate change. At the same time, various health financing arrangements need to be adapted to address the rising health needs and expenditure. Some of these adaptations also support the necessary changes to make the health system resilient. Adaptation measures serve to adjust to actual or expected climate change and its effects, and to reduce vulnerability.Sparse documentation is available on how climate financing is (or can be) used for the health sector.4 The recent WHO Operational framework for building climate resilient and low carbon health systems2 covers financing for climate change and health interventions. Here, we link to this WHO work and delve further into the health financing functions, that is, revenue raising, pooling and purchasing (Box 1). This paper is geared towards health financing policy-makers. To contribute to the conceptualization, awareness raising and agenda setting of the role of health financing, this article provides an initial overview of policy options for mitigation and adaptation measures within health financing that national or subnational governments could and/or already apply, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries. Finally, we identify some key questions that can help advance the policy and research agenda for health financing to support climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems. We emphasize that such health financing policy measures are only one part of the overall government and societal response, and need to be closely aligned with wider government action.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Effect of Environmental Degradation, Climate Change, and the European Green Deal Tools on Life Satisfaction","Environmental issues, sustainability, and climate change have become the targets of many policies from international and governmental organizations including the EU’s European Green Deal action plan. This plan provides tools to address them—which include support for the circular economy, implementation of energy and environmental taxes, and investment in environmental protection—with the aim of favoring the well-being of EU citizens. In this context, this study analyses the impact of several parameters (environmental matters, global warming, circular economy, energy and environmental taxes, and expenditure and investment on the environment) on life satisfaction, or subjective well-being, and their effects on 33 European countries. For this purpose, four econometric models were carried out using data collected from the World Values Survey (WVS), the European Values Study (EVS), and the World Bank and Eurostat, reflecting subjective citizen satisfaction data. The findings present a highly significant inverse relationship between life satisfaction variables and both environmental problems and energy taxes. Additionally, there is a highly significant positive relationship between circular economy, environmental tax, and environmental protection expenditure parameters and life satisfaction variables, as well as, to a lesser degree of significance, with noise pollution from neighbours.",Not About Sufficiency

Land Cover Implications on Ecosystem Service Delivery: a Multi-Scenario Study of Trade-offs and Synergies in River Basins,"Land cover change scenarios hold far-reaching implications for ecosystem services (ES), highlighting the need for understanding the trade-offs and synergies underlying the provision of multiple ES. The insufficient knowledge of the mechanisms governing the relationships among multiple ES, along with the lack of information on trade-offs among ES under different scenarios, restricts the ability to provide effective information for decision-makers. To fill this gap, we assessed the interplay among six ES: climate regulation, habitat creating and maintaining species diversity, cultivated crops, regulation of the chemical condition of freshwaters by living processes (water quality), water yield, and control of erosion rates, within three river basins in northwest Portugal. We employed the InVEST to map the state of these ES in 2018, along with three projected land cover scenarios for 2050: business-as-usual, farmland return, and afforestation. Our findings indicated the business-as-usual scenario could lead to detrimental impacts on climate regulation, habitat creating and maintaining species diversity, and control of erosion rates. In contrast, the farmland return scenario showed less drastic decreases in habitat-creating and maintaining species diversity and control of erosion rates compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Afforestation emerged as the most favorable scenario, with a 13.6% increase in climate regulation and a 1.3% improvement in habitat-creating and maintaining species diversity. Cluster analysis allowed the identification of six levels of spatial synergies between ES, with regions of high forest cover showing extreme synergy and populated areas exhibiting the lowest levels of synergy, suggesting that a well-planned combination of these practices could yield substantial benefits for future ES provision. These results provide crucial insights for decision-makers to enhance ecosystem management and promote societal well-being. Importantly, our findings underscore the significance of considering multiple ES and their interrelationships in land use planning to achieve sustainable development objectives.",Not About Sufficiency
"Barriers, Challenges, and Opportunities in the Adoption of the Circular Economy in Mexico: An Analysis through Social Perception","This study explores the transition toward sustainable economic models through the circular economy (CE) in Mexico. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, this research incorporates a comprehensive literature review and analyzes responses from 42 stakeholders, gathered through surveys and focus groups. These stakeholders comprise a diverse group including PhD students, professors, researchers, industry professionals in sustainability and the environment, and government advisors and coordinators from the Mexican Secretary of Environment. This representative sample provides a broad perspective on the barriers, opportunities, and societal perceptions regarding CE. The findings reveal significant challenges such as economic barriers, regulatory inadequacies, and a lack of awareness and education, all of which hinder the adoption of CE practices. Despite these challenges, there is a generally optimistic view among stakeholders about CE’s potential to positively impact societal needs, suggesting robust opportunities for innovation and policy enhancement to foster sustainable development. Key recommendations include intensifying educational programs to elevate public understanding and engagement, formulating supportive policies that facilitate CE adoption, and promoting intersectoral collaboration to leverage collective expertise and resources. Additionally, the research underscores the necessity of integrating CE principles into urban planning and policy frameworks to effectively address specific local challenges such as waste management, pollution, and urban sprawl. By providing a detailed analysis of the current state and potential of CE in Mexico, this paper contributes valuable insights to the global discourse on sustainability. It proposes strategic actions to overcome existing hurdles and capitalize on opportunities within the CE framework, charting a path forward for Mexico and serving as a model for other regions facing similar sustainability challenges",Not About Sufficiency
"Reconstructing Classic Maya socioeconomic differentiation and the collapse at Dos Pilas, Peten, Guatemala","Three field seasons of extensive residential archaeology at Dos Pilas, Peten, Guatemala, provide important data for the examination of ancient Maya social structure and the Classic Period collapse in the Petexbatun region.

Within the model, the rate of aggregate demand growth affects both the level of aggregate demand and the rate of output growth. However, demand growth management can only be used to shift the economy from low to high growth equilibria, and cannot produce continuous adjustments in the equilibrium rate of growth. This reveals that management of the growth trajectory is a qualitatively different problematic from management of the level of output. Lastly, the model highlights ambiguities regarding the adjustment dynamics of demand growth. Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 1997.",Not About Sufficiency

Toward a just circular economy: conceptualizing environmental labor and gender justice in circularity studies,"Over the past decade, the concept of circular economy (CE) has gained political traction as a potential solution to economy-environment tradeoffs. However, critical social scientists have raised concerns that CE may not address the root causes or consequences of environmental degradation, thus remaining ineffective. Concurring with this critique, this article highlights three constituent elements of the linear economy that remain unaddressed in CE frameworks: environmental, labor, and gender inequalities. Building upon scholarship from environmental justice, environmental labor studies, and feminist ecological economics, we elaborate a conceptual framework to interrogate the existing literature. Our analysis shows that current CE models 1) are mainly concerned with return on capital investment and sustained growth of gross domestic product (GDP) rather than with redressing the North/South inequalities embedded in the linear economy model; 2) present a limited perspective on labor, with a primary focus on the number of jobs to be created, rather than their quality, or workers’ leadership; and 3) overlook gender inequalities and the sexual division of labor, thus reproducing the devaluation of care that lays at the roots of socioecological crises. We conclude by suggesting avenues for elaborating a “just circular economy” framework.",Not About Sufficiency
International justice and environmental policy: tradeable permits for carbon emissions,"Several proposals have been put forward for the restriction of global carbon emissions as being justified in the interests of environmental justice or other ethical grounds. In the first part of this paper the more popular of these are discussed, and it is argued that their ethical foundations are, in fact, very flimsy. This is followed by an examination of the concept of ""environmental justice', which is explicit or implicit in much of the literature on equity aspects of environmental policy, and it is concluded that such a concept, as distinct from justice in general, is not a useful one. The main central section of the paper goes on to discuss, more generally, what principals of international justice can be identified that might have practical application to problems such as those of sharing internationally the burdens of environmental protection. A final section of the paper puts forward some concrete proposals for the initial allocation of carbon emissions, and argues that these represent a reasonable compromise between alternative equitable criteria. -from Authors",Not About Sufficiency
Techno-environmental analysis to valorize the secondary energy resources from refuse-derived fuel-based waste to energy plant,"The present study quantifies the environmental and sustainability impacts associated with municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in India which plays a vital environmental issue in recent times. The upsurge in population has resulted in massive waste generation, leading to a concerning rise in the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, the sustainable management of MSW has been discussed and highlights the conversion of MSW into refuse-derived fuel (RDF) to identify its potential for generating electricity in waste-to-energy (WtE) plants. The life cycle assessment (LCA) study has been done to identify and compare the environmental impacts associated with different scenarios (SC) as SC1: landfilling without energy recovery, SC2: open burning and SC3: processing of RDF in WtE plant by considering the nine impact categories from the inventory data obtained over a period of 12 consecutive months (Jan 2021–Jan 2022). The results exhibited that the global warming potential caused by emissions of GHG are in the order of SC1 (1188 kg CO2 eq) > SC2 (752 kg CO2 eq) > SC3 (332 kg CO2 eq), respectively from 1 t of MSW. It is concluded that the WtE plant can help in the reduction of environmental issues, strengthening the capacity of electricity generation and improving the aesthetic view of the city which is socially acceptable as well. Thus, WtE technology can help in achieving sustainable development goal 12 to regenerate the sustainable secondary resources for the twenty-first century and minimize global climate change.",Not About Sufficiency

Pathways to zero emissions in California's heavy-duty transportation sector,"California contributes 0.75% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and has a target of reaching economy-wide net zero emissions by 2045, requiring all sectors to rapidly reduce emissions. Nearly 8% of California's GHG emissions are from the heavy-duty transportation sector. In this work, we simulate decarbonization strategies for the heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) fleet using detailed fleet turnover and air quality models to track evolution of the fleet, GHG and criteria air pollutant emissions, and resulting air quality and health impacts across sociodemographic groups. We assess the effectiveness of two types of policies: zero emission vehicle sales mandates, and accelerated retirement policies. For policies including early retirements, we estimate the cost of early retirements and the cost-effectiveness of each policy. We find even a policy mandating all HDV sales to be zero emission vehicles by 2025 would not achieve fleetwide zero emissions by 2045. For California to achieve its goal of carbon neutrality, early retirement policies are needed. We find that a combination of early retirement policies and zero emission vehicle sales mandates could reduce cumulative CO2 emissions by up to 64%. Furthermore, we find that decarbonization policies will significantly reduce air pollution-related mortality, and that Black, Latino, and low-income communities will benefit most. We find that policies targeting long-haul heavy-heavy duty trucks would have the greatest benefits and be most cost-effective.",Not About Sufficiency
"Impact of Land Use Change on the Habitat Quality Evolution in Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China","Habitat quality (HQ) is an important indicator to characterize the level of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and can reflect the quality of the human living environment. Changes in land use can disturb regional HQ. Current research mostly focuses on assessing the good or bad quality of regional habitats, and less on the spatial response relationship between land use change and HQ, and even fewer studies on finely distinguishing the impact of land use types on HQ. Therefore, taking Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) of China as the study area, this paper first analyzes the land use change of study area by using the land use transfer matrix, land use rate model and landscape pattern index, and then combines the InVEST model with the multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model to build a refined assessment framework to quantitatively assess the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of HQ, and then analyse in detail the spatial response relationship of each land use type change on the impact of HQ. The results showed that from 2000 to 2020, the land use in the TGRA shows a changing state of “urban expansion, cultivated land shrinkage, forest land growth, and grassland degradation”. With the change in land use, the habitat quality index (HQI) in the study area showed an “ increase first and then decline” change characteristics, and the HQ degradation was more obvious in the areas with intense human activities. The impact of land use change over the past 20 years on HQ in the TGRA has significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with changes in paddy and dryland having mainly negative impacts on HQ, and changes in sparse land, shrubland, and medium-cover grassland having mainly positive impacts on HQ. This paper mainly provides a research framework for refined assessment, and the results can provide scientific support for land planning and ecological protection in the TGRA, and the research methods and ideas can provide references for similar research.",Not About Sufficiency
Perceived social welfare as a driver of green products consumption: Evidences from an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture production,"This study investigated consumers' perceptions of green products derived from a circular economy production, by shedding light on the role of perceived social welfare.

Respondents received a structured questionnaire containing scales that measured perceived social welfare, environmentalism, green product's perception (in terms of price, quality and useful-ness), purchase intention, and word-of-mouth. The results revealed an inverse relationship between perceived social welfare and the behavioral variables. Consumers were more attracted to and focused on the green product's usefulness than its price and quality. Moreover, the study found that environmentalism (in terms of environmental concern and perceived consumer effectiveness) moderate the effect of perceived social welfare on dependent variables. By exploring the role of perceived social welfare as a regressor, this study improves our understanding of consumers' behavior toward green products.",Not About Sufficiency

International evidence,"ObjectiveThis study examines the determinants of green total factor productivity in marine fisheries, considering the role of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14) in promoting sustainable marine resource utilization and conservation.MethodsThis study employs panel data from 57 countries between 2001 and 2021 to estimate efficiency scores through the directional distance function and the Malmquist–Luenberger model by incorporating inputs (labor, fishing vessels, and energy consumption) and outputs (gross ocean product and carbon dioxide emissions). A truncated regression analysis is conducted to explore the relationship between SDG 14 and green total factor productivity (GTFP) while controlling for financial resources and macroeconomic indicators.ResultThe findings indicate that SDG 14 significantly enhances both constant returns to scale (CRS) technical efficiency and variable returns to scale (VRS) pure technical efficiency, underscoring the importance of marine conservation and sustainable resource management. Additionally, financial resources (like green lending and government investment), research and innovation (like research and development, the number of researchers, and foreign funds), and macroeconomic factors (like the gross ocean product, gross domestic product, and inflation) positively influence green productivity.ConclusionThe results underscore the importance of marine conservation and sustainable practices for enhancing GTFP in fisheries. Integrated policies focusing on financial investment, innovation, and macroeconomic stability are essential to achieve greater sustainability and efficiency in this sector.",Not About Sufficiency
Science and policy implications of defining environmental justice,"Although 'environmental justice' is an increasingly important issue for policy makers and researchers, it remains for many a vague and abstract notion that is hard to define in practical, real-world terms. Part of the problem is that environmental justice is a complex, multidimensional construct that cannot easily be defined. Our aim in this article is to identify fundamental dimensions of environmental justice and highlight the resulting questions that are an inherent part of putting principles into practice. We argue that to have a constructive and informed debate about this emotionally charged topic, it is necessary to have a clear and workable definition of environmental justice. We do not propose our own definition, but instead point out that there are many possible legitimate definitions depending on one's beliefs, opinions, and values. The central point is not that a particular definition is right or wrong, but rather that choosing a definition has distinct implications for the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of both policy and science. These critical choices should be made explicit so that public dialogue can focus on the substance of this important policy issue.",Not About Sufficiency

Piercing the corporate veil: Towards a better assessment of the position of transnational oil and gas companies in the global carbon budget,"In recent years, research in climate science has increasingly emphasized the need to reduce fossil fuel supply in order to avoid an overshoot of the global carbon budget and to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global warming 'well below 2 degrees C'. This article aims to outline a balanced appreciation of the particular responsibility held by transnational oil and gas companies in the global challenge to organize an equitably managed decline in fossil fuel extraction. It does so by focusing on a case study. The latter consists of the stylized reconstruction of the internal social dynamics that shape the power structure of the French firm Total and of questioning its ability to make investment decisions aligned with the imperative to preserve the stability of the climate system, as its public position makes clear. The persistence of short-termed compensation schemes in the higher corporate hierarchy impedes the elaboration and implementation of deep decarbonization strategies at the firm level. These would imply a significant upscaling of investments in renewable energy and/or carbon-capture storage technologies, in order to avoid the foreseeable destruction of corporate jobs linked to oil and gas extraction in an increasingly carbon-constrained world.",Not About Sufficiency
Bio-energy and the environment: Land of possible misunderstanding,"Climate change, environmental degradation, agriculture decline burdened with heavy socio-economic implications and increasing energy needs for sustainable development and economic growth, have stimulated a frenetic search for acceptable solutions to improve this critical situation. Biomass production and utilization for energy has given rise to many discussions for its environmental impact. This paper presents a point of view that bio-energy could assume sustainable environmental features for our future. The principal arguments of this paper are: bio-energy system and carbon emission - including confrontation of C02emissions between a biomass electricity closed system and a coal-based electric generation system - soil erosion, fertilizer use, pesticide use, and biodiversity. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Planetary Boundaries for Forests and Their National Exceedance,"Achieving forest sustainability is a declared sustainable development goal (SDG 15). Measuring the safe operating space-planetary boundaries-of global forests is essential to determine global forest pressure and manage forests sustainably. Here, we quantify the forestry planetary boundary (FPB) and national forestry boundaries. Results show that, in 2015, the FPB was 7.1 billion m3 of forest stock increments. Global timber harvests account for 58.7% of the FPB. Timber harvests of 47 nations, mostly in Africa and Asia, have exceeded their national forestry boundaries. Their boundary-exceeding timber harvest is mainly driven by the final demand of developed nations (e.g., the United States and Japan) and emerging economies (e.g., India and China) through global supply chains. This study highlights the importance of the FPB in global forest management and trade-related policymaking. The findings can guide global and national forest harvesting activities and help promote international cooperation to mitigate global deforestation.",Not About Sufficiency
Plant Power: Opportunities and challenges for meeting sustainable energy needs from the plant and fungal kingdoms,"Societal Impact Statement Bioenergy is a major component of the global transition to renewable energy technologies. The plant and fungal kingdoms offer great potential but remain mostly untapped. Their increased use could contribute to the renewable energy transition and addressing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 ""Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all."" Current research focuses on species cultivated at scale in temperate regions, overlooking the wealth of potential new sources of small-scale energy where they are most urgently needed. A shift towards diversified, accessible bioenergy technologies will help to mitigate and adapt to the threats of climate change, decrease energy poverty, improve human health by reducing indoor pollution, increase energy resilience of communities, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. SummaryBioenergy derived from plants and fungi is a major component of the global transition to renewable energy technologies. There is rich untapped diversity in the plant and fungal kingdoms that offers potential to contribute to the shift away from fossil fuels and to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) ""Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all."" Energy poverty-the lack of access to modern energy services-is most acute in the Global South where biodiversity is greatest and least investigated. Our systematic review of the literature over the last 5 years (2015-2020) indicates that research efforts have targeted a very small number of plant species cultivated at scale, mostly in temperate regions. The wealth of potential new sources of bioenergy in biodiverse regions, where the implementation of SDG7 is most urgently needed, has been largely overlooked. We recommend next steps for bioenergy stakeholders-research, industry, and government-to seize opportunities for innovation to alleviate energy poverty while protecting biodiversity. Small-scale energy production using native plant species in bioenergy landscapes overcomes many pitfalls associated with bioenergy crop monocultures, such as biodiversity loss and conflict with food production. Targeted trait-based screening of plant species and biological screening of fungi are required to characterize the potential of this resource. The benefits of diversified, accessible bioenergy go beyond the immediate urgency of energy poverty as more diverse agricultural landscapes are more resilient, store more carbon, and could also reduce the drivers of the climate and environmental emergencies.",Not About Sufficiency
"Plastic Pollution, Waste Management Issues, and Circular Economy Opportunities in Rural Communities","Rural areas are exposed to severe environmental pollution issues fed by industrial and agricultural activities combined with poor waste and sanitation management practices, struggling to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in line with Agenda 2030. Rural communities are examined through a ""dual approach"" as both contributors and receivers of plastic pollution leakage into the natural environment (through the air-water-soil-biota nexus). Despite the emerging trend of plastic pollution research, in this paper, we identify few studies investigating rural communities. Therefore, proxy analysis of peer-reviewed literature is required to outline the significant gaps related to plastic pollution and plastic waste management issues in rural regions. This work focuses on key stages such as (i) plastic pollution effects on rural communities, (ii) plastic pollution generated by rural communities, (iii) the development of a rural waste management sector in low- and middle-income countries in line with the SDGs, and (iv) circular economy opportunities to reduce plastic pollution in rural areas. We conclude that rural communities must be involved in both future plastic pollution and circular economy research to help decision makers reduce environmental and public health threats, and to catalyze circular initiatives in rural areas around the world, including less developed communities.",Not About Sufficiency
Playing for the Planet? A Serious Game Approach to Land Use Planning with Students in Rural Iceland,"Effective nature conservation and citizen participation are essential for sustainable development and biodiversity preservation. This paper introduces the 'Land Use Game', a prototype serious game designed to engage citizens-particularly younger demographics-in participatory land use planning. Developed within the context of the EU Horizon 2020 PHOENIX project, the game was tested with students in two rural Icelandic municipalities as part of a pilot study. The game enables participants to assign land use preferences through interactive mapping, supporting a better understanding of land use complexities while promoting active learning and dialogue. The study evaluates the game's feasibility, technological features, and practical applications, highlighting insights from gameplay observations, participant feedback, and spatial analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of serious games to collect meaningful data, support inclusive decision-making, and empower citizens to contribute to sustainable policies. By incorporating such tools, planners can enhance public understanding, promote equitable land use, and strengthen participatory democracy.",Not About Sufficiency
"Pluralizing energy justice: Incorporating feminist, anti-racist, Indigenous, and postcolonial perspectives","Justice represents not only a moral obligation but can enhance the legitimacy and acceptance of a rapid push toward global decarbonization. Innovations in technology, even those geared toward sustainability, can both reinforce and introduce new inequalities and disparities across populations, while also perpetuating environmental degradation. The concept of energy justice has emerged as a conceptual, methodological, and empirical tool to both highlight and remediate many of these concerns, with an emphasis on what is morally just or right. But much of this body of scholarship fails to adequately account for gender, Indigeneity, race, and other intersecting inequalities. Feminist, Indigenous, anti-racist and postcolonial approaches to justice offer an important remedy to theories of justice with underlying colonial, liberalist, majoritarian, utilitarian, or masculinist assumptions. Our Perspective is grounded in these four core, but often misperceived or even radical, approaches to justice. We first provide an overview of each of these approaches and then synthesize them into a set of themes, principles, and questions, which can guide future energy justice research and practice.",Not About Sufficiency
Policies for energy conservation and sufficiency: Review of existing policies and recommendations for new and effective policies in OECD countries,"There is a strong consent among scholars and policy makers that limiting current global energy demand and gradually reducing it towards a sustainable level of consumption is a key component of any strategies and pathways to reach the Paris Agreement climate target, and, in particular, carbon neutrality by mid-century. Given the stringency and urgency of the climate target and the current global increase of energy demand, in addition to investments in energy efficiency technologies, there is the need for a change of energy end-users behaviour and life style to obtain additional energy savings by limiting the demand for services. Traditionally, energy efficiency policies have mainly targeted and promoted energy efficient technologies (e.g., energy performance standards for vehicles, appliances and buildings, financial incen-tives for new technologies, etc.). In some cases, the energy savings achieved have been less than expected, due to a rebound effect, or because external factors (e.g., growth in populations or economies) have increased energy consumption. The ""traditional"" energy efficiency policies are still very necessary, but are not sufficient for reaching the Paris Agreement target and the rapid reduction of the energy demand. Policies focusing on energy conservation and sufficiency principles complement efficiency policies, in particular those aiming at changing end-user consumer behaviour and lifestyle by imposing some limi-tation to the demand for energy services. The article first reviews the concept of energy savings compared to energy efficiency and introduce the concept of energy sufficiency. Then the article explores and dis-cusses some existing and new policy instruments that can address energy conservation and sufficiency such as: personal carbon allowances; energy/carbon taxation; progressive appliance and vehicles stan-dards, and progressive building codes. The article's focus is mainly on individual end-users and on resi-dential buildings. Finally, the article provides an ex-ante assessment of the policies analysed, including their limitations, and offers some policy recommendations, based on a combination of instruments.(c) 2022 The Author.

Politicising Circular Economy: what can we learn from Responsible Innovation?,"The 'Circular Economy' has become a new buzzword in debates about sustainability. Circularity, however, is usually presented in terms of scientific and technological challenges that often neglect the socio-political aspects related to the transition towards more sustainable futures, such as participation, co-creation and social justice. We argue that the Circular Economy agenda might greatly benefit from the field of Responsible Innovation. This argument is at the centre of the EU funded project, 'A Just Transition to Circular Economy' (JUST2CE), which aspires to address the present shortcomings of Circular Economy literature and practices. JUST2CE aims at understanding, in a critical way, under which conditions a responsible, inclusive and socially just transition to a Circular Economy is possible and desirable, what technical, political and social factors can enable or hamper such transformation and how these aspects can contribute to the development of transitional policy measures.",Not About Sufficiency
"Potentials for prosperity without growth: Ecological sustainability, social inclusion and the quality of life in 38 countries","Recent contributions to ecological economics and related social sciences indicate that issues such as climate change, resource depletion and environmental degradation cannot be effectively addressed under conditions of continued economic growth. This paper aims at empirically identifying structural potentials and policy challenges for prosperity at scales where economic development remains within ecological carrying capacities. Building on the growing literature that interprets prosperity 'beyond' economic growth, the paper presents a three-dimensional concept to operationalise prosperity in terms of ecological sustainability, social inclusion, and the quality of life. These dimensions are measured using data from sources such as The World Bank, the Global Footprint Network and the OECD. The results of cluster and correspondence analyses indicate the existence of five 'prosperity regimes' and demonstrate that all aspects of prosperity - including (unsatisfactory) ecological performance - are linked to economic development. However, our findings also indicate that in order to achieve a decent minimum of prosperity moderate levels of the material living standard are sufficient Further increases in the material living standard do not lead to significant additional prosperity; instead they cause greater environmental harms. The paper concludes by highlighting potentials for prosperity for each of the 'prosperity regimes' and corresponding policy challenges. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Poverty Alleviation Through Accounting and Partnerships: A Systematic Review and Future Research Directions,"This study analyzes carbon accounting (CA) and true cost accounting (TCA) to measure decarbonization practices to meet the sustainable development goal (SDG) 1 (end poverty in all its forms everywhere). These tools can empower firms to achieve insightful data to pursue a balance between economic, environmental, and social goals. This study also investigates the role of partnerships (SDG 17) in sharing resources and knowledge while adopting decarbonization practices to achieve SDG1. Leveraging SDG17 to meet SDG1 and the overall business model, this study introduces the concept of poverty alleviation business models. This study analyzed 172 articles published between 1990 and 2024 from the Scopus database and Google Scholar using descriptive, bibliometric, and network analyses as well as content analysis. The results highlight that CA helps firms develop decarbonization strategies to promote sustainable practices for SDG1 based on partnerships. This study also highlights that TCA evaluates the economic, social, and environmental impacts of firms' activities, enabling sustainable decision-making and identifying opportunities for poverty alleviation business models. This study provides a pioneering analysis of corporate decarbonization by examining how firms can develop a balanced business model that integrates economic, environmental, and social goals, specifically SDG1. This study explores on the one hand CA and TCA as managerial tools for measuring decarbonization practices through new technologies and renewable resources and, on the other hand, SDG17, particularly Target 17.G, to advance SDG1. This study contributes a novel conceptual framework for poverty alleviation business models that has not been adequately addressed in the history of accounting research.",Not About Sufficiency
Powering a Sustainable and Circular Economy-An Engineering Approach to Estimating Renewable Energy Potentials within Earth System Boundaries,"This study proposes a method to estimate the appropriability of renewable energy resources at the global scale, when Earth system boundaries/needs and the human demand for chemical energy are respected. The method is based on an engineering approach, i.e., uncertainties of parameters and models are considered and potentials calculated with 99% confidence. We used literature data to test our method and provide initial results for global appropriable technical potentials (ATP) that sum up to 71TW, which is significantly larger than the current global energy demand. Consequently, there is sufficient renewable energy potentially available to increase energy access for a growing world population as well as for a development towards increasingly closed material cycles within the technosphere. Solar energy collected on the built environment (29%) and in desert areas (69%) represent the dominant part of this potential, followed in great distance by hydro (0.6%), terrestrial heat (0.4%), wind (0.35%), and biomass (0.2%). Furthermore, we propose indicators to evaluate an energy mix on different levels, from an energy mix in single products to the mix used by the global economy, against the estimated RE potentials, which allow an evaluation and consideration in the design of sustainable-circular products and systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Green Growth Analysis of Social Development in OECD Countries,"This paper seeks to elucidate the inter and intrarelationships between a selected set of OECD green growth indicators (GGI). In addition to the selected GGI, the analysis includes the Human Development Index (HDI) and its sub-indicators. The novelty of the analysis comes from the incorporation of these established indicators, which have been utilised and developed to reflect human well-being and prosperity for decades. Production-based CO2 intensity and emission change are significantly correlated to average length of schooling across the 36 countries that were members of the OECD in the year 2019. Longer years spent in school on average can facilitate the green transition of countries. The correlations among intra-GGI also suggest where OECD countries are lagging in terms of green transition. For example, renewable energy supply share in energy and air transport-related CO2 per capita are positively correlated in the countries. This indicates that countries with a successful path toward green energy are not paying much attention to their high level of CO2 emissions caused by aviation. Infrastructural and technological advancement as well as increased public awareness are needed to challenge such issues.",Not About Sufficiency
Predicting land use changes and ecosystem service impacts with CA-Markov and machine learning techniques,"Urban ecosystem services play a vital role in increasing resilience against environmental challenges, providing human well-being benefits, and conserving biodiversity within rapidly urbanizing areas. This study investigates land use and land cover (LULC) changes across three districts in Telangana -Medchal-Malkajgiri, Warangal, and Ranga Reddy-over the past several decades, specifically their effects on ecosystem service values (ESV). Utilizing the Benefit Transfer Methodology, we assessed the effects of urban expansion on ESV by measuring significant increases in built-up areas that have replaced natural landscapes. This transformation has resulted in decreased capacity to provide essential ecosystem services such as climate regulation, water quality regulation and biodiversit & Aring;y conservation. Water bodies emerged as key contributors to ecosystem services provision-emphasizing their significance for urban resilience. Medchal-Malkajgiri, Warangal and Ranga Reddy districts in Telangana are experiencing rapid urbanization as a result of Hyderabad's expansion and rapid infrastructure development. This transformation of agricultural lands into urbanized spaces threatens ecosystem services such as water resources and biodiversity while jeopardizing long-term environmental sustainability-this study evaluates these effects and offers essential insight for planning sustainable urban environments. Our results reveal a responsive relationship between ecosystem services (ESV) and land use change (LULC), such that changes to land use directly impact ecosystem service availability and quality. Our findings offer actionable insights to policymakers by emphasizing the necessity for urban planning strategies which prioritize ecosystem preservation alongside development to foster sustainable urban growth.",Not About Sufficiency

Pricing decisions and social welfare in a supply chain with multiple competing retailers and carbon tax policy,"This paper investigates whether implementing carbon tax policy alters supply chain members' pricing decisions and social welfare. We also consider consumer environmental awareness (CEA), which is currently growing, and we focus on the impact of CEA, retail competitive intensity and other factors on the optimal carbon tax rate and social welfare. We address the issue from the point of view of a policy planner whose goal is to maximize social welfare. Additionally, we consider two different market scenarios: a bilateral monopoly situation and a scenario with multiple competing retailers. In terms of the impact on pricing, the retail price and wholesale price increase with the carbon tax rate in both scenarios. The market demand for the retailer that sells a more environmentally friendly product relative to other competing retailers will increase with the carbon tax rate in the scenario with competing retailers. Additionally, the government's carbon tax regulation at the optimal tax rate can effectively improve social welfare when carbon emissions per unit of product are large or the price of carbon dioxide is high in both scenarios, regardless of the extent of CEA. Further, when the competitive strength of an industry in the retail market is high, the government can also implement carbon tax regulation to reduce social welfare losses. Moreover, compared with the monopoly situation, the intuitive carbon tax rate is closer to the optimal carbon tax rate in the competitive situation, and thus, it will be better able to reduce social welfare losses.

Pricing Strategy and Social Welfare in a Supply Chain With Different Rights Structure Under Carbon Tax Policy,"Aiming at the pricing and emission reduction decision-making problem of a two-level supply chain consisting of multiple manufacturers and multiple retailers, this paper proposes a consistent pricing mechanism based on multi-agent structure to coordinate the supply chain, and the operation of supply chain participants from competition to cooperation. The proposed algorithm is distributed and collaborative, thus eliminating the need for a central snap-ins, central price coordinators, or leaders. Firstly, a two-level supply chain social welfare model with multi-agent structure is established, and the system nodes in this model are scalable. Then, the pricing and carbon tax policies of the supply chain under different dominant rights are discussed to determine the optimal transaction price and carbon tax policies in order to maximize social welfare. The research results show that the transaction price increases with the increase of the carbon tax rate, and the social welfare decreases with the increase of the carbon tax rate, so the government should formulate the carbon tax within a reasonable range. It is also found that the overall social welfare obtained when there is no dominant node is higher than the social welfare obtained when there is dominant node. It can guide the market to optimize the allocation of resources according to production needs, so as to achieve the maximum efficient use and social welfare.",Not About Sufficiency
Principles for a sustainable circular economy,"The pressure that the human species exerts on the natural environment through the extraction of materials and generation of wastes is widely recognised. Circular economy has emerged as a potential solution to make better use of resources. Positioned as a technology-focused concept that can generate economic gains while alleviating pressure on the environment, circular economy enjoys a positive reception by organisations in public, private and civic sectors and, increasingly, academia alike. However, concerns have been raised regarding some purported circular economy practices being promoted as 'sustainable' yet resulting in detrimental impacts on environment and society. We briefly revisit the systems ecology literature that construed the context for both circular economy and sustainable development. Values and principles in core sustainable development literature are analysed to offer a foundation against which circular economy can be discussed. We then analyse and critically reflect upon the strengths, shortcomings and theoretical flaws within the values and principles that emerged from the evolving circular economy literature. We propose a value framework and set of ten principles for the design, implementation and evaluation of a sustainable circular economy. We finish with a call for action for both practitioners and a research agenda for academia. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Initially, this conference was planned to be held in Thailand. Later on, due to the covid-19 pandemic situation and travel restrictions imposed by various Governments, the options available was to either postpone, cancel or conduct in virtual mode. Postponement was too unsure, since it’s not clear when normalcy will be restored, conducive for physical conference. Cancellation of the conference will upset and disappoint people who have contributed to the conference. Hence the committee decided to go for online mode on the same dates as planned earlier. The organizers hosted the conference from Chennai, India. By meeting virtually, the conference incorporated 8 SDGs – SDG 3,4,5,6,8,10,16,17.This conference and these proceedings are a unique opportunity for sharing ideas and achievements, discoveries and innovation for growing together our knowledge and contribute to expand the knowledge of humanity. The technological areas addressed in this meeting is in response to United Nations call of action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.The conference covers topics on the interdisciplinary areas of agriculture and food security, biodiversity conservation, circular economy, cities and urbanisation, climate change in holistic context, development, economy, ecosystem services, ecological protection, education, energy, environmental development, environmental law, finance, gender equality, green infrastructure, health and environment, human population, industrialization, innovation, land cover and land use change, natural capital, natural resources conservation and management, pollution, poverty, social and cultural, supply chain, waste, water–energy–food and water-soil-waste connections and others, all as related to sustainability.We received 52 papers and after peer review 17 papers were accepted and presented in this conference. The papers were evaluated on the basis of completeness, relevance to the conference, originality, sufficiently novel, technical quality, structure and presentation of the paper and adequate references to previous work.

Projecting spatial interactions between global population and land use changes in the 21st century,"Previous research on global urban land expansion has primarily focused on accommodating the growing population without adequately considering the trade-offs between urban land and ecological services. Consequently, it is important to investigate the effect of this expansion on the ecological service system, while also examining the potential trade-offs between population growth and available urban land. Here, we quantify how different global land expansion options contribute to reconciling global population changes and to compliance with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 on sustainable cities and human settlements. Using an integrated framework for projecting global land consumption with the trade-off strategy between global land expansion and population under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), we aim to bridge the knowledge gap in this area. The results of our study suggest that implementing a trade-off strategy between global land expansion and population growth can successfully reduce the levels of global land consumption in the future. Under the SSP1 scenario, for instance, our findings indicate that implementing trade-off policies can significantly reduce land consumption while increasing carbon sinks and protecting the global ecological service system. Specifically, converting land to forest or grassland can help decrease land consumption by 8.07% by the end of the 21st century. These insights can be valuable in designing land use policies that incorporate data-based solutions and address the challenges of sustainable urban development while also accommodating population growth.",Not About Sufficiency
Provincial equity and enhanced health are key drivers for China's 2060 carbon neutrality,"China's ambitious 2060 carbon neutrality target necessitates innovative strategies to address the country's status as the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. This study employs the Global Change Analysis Model to develop a provincial-differentiated control strategy (EQU scenario) that not only aims to meet the national carbon neutrality goal but also enhances population health and environmental equity. The EQU scenario forecasts substantial reductions in average population weighted PM2.5 and O3 concentrations to 7 mu g/m3 and 34 ppb, respectively, by 2060. In comparison to a baseline scenario (NEU), the EQU scenario offers more equitable air quality improvements and significant health benefits, potentially preventing 39 thousand PM2.5-related and 10 thousand O3-related premature deaths, with minimal additional cost. The Gini coefficient, indicating CO2 emission distribution inequality among provinces, is projected to decrease from 0.58 in NEU to 0.37 in EQU. This scenario anticipates about one-third of provinces achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, with a harmonized provincial carbon neutrality capacity. The study highlights the critical importance of integrating provincially differentiated controls within national decarbonization strategies, advancing equitable deep decarbonization and reinforcing environmental justice in China.",Not About Sufficiency
Provisioning for sufficiency: envisaging production corridors,"This article deepens the framework of a sufficiency economy, defining sufficiency as the space between a floor of meeting needs and a ceiling of ungeneralizable excess. This framework can be applied to the domains of consumption and production. Complementing existing research on consumption corridors, our aim is to conceptualize the idea of a production corridor. To develop this notion, we survey a range of helpful concepts starting with objective and universal human needs to establish a “floor” and planetary boundaries to establish a “ceiling.” We then assess in some detail a range of conceptual debates that pertain to production: 1) Marxian categories of labor, 2) the production boundary, 3) provisioning and the foundational economy, 4) social reproduction, and 5) unnecessary labor. These debates permit us to start identifying essential production, which enables the satisfaction of human needs within planetary boundaries, and excess production, which contributes neither to need satisfaction nor human flourishing but drives planetary overshoot. This distinction further allows for an “in-between” domain of the economy, situated between the floor and ceiling. This discussion concludes with a more detailed model of production embedded in the framework of the sufficiency economy. We then “dynamize” this model to sketch a production corridor under climate-mitigation imperatives. It considers in turn the essential economy, the excess economy, and the in-between economy. The final section summarizes our depiction of the production corridor leading to rapid but fair decarbonization of the economy.",Not About Sufficiency

We then ""dynamize"" this model to sketch a production corridor under climate-mitigation imperatives. It considers in turn the essential economy, the excess economy, and the in-between economy. The final section summarizes our depiction of the production corridor leading to rapid but fair decarbonization of the economy.",Not About Sufficiency
Public participation GIS scenarios for decision-making on land-use requirements for renewable energy systems,"BackgroundThe transition to renewable energy is crucial for decarbonising the energy system but creates land-use competition. Whilst there is consensus on the need for local responsibility in achieving climate neutrality, debates continue over where to implement renewable energy plants. The Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) scenario approach can facilitate these debates and improve equity and procedural and distributive justice.ResultsThe findings highlight the effectiveness of the PPGIS method in assessing the spatial impact of technologies on agriculture and landscapes. The approach was tested in a rural German municipality to help stakeholders and citizens recognise the potential for land-based solar energy even under strict constraints. These insights were shared to support decision-makers on land-use changes to increase renewable energy production.ConclusionsThe findings indicate that the PPGIS scenario approach is valuable for improving equity and mutual understanding in local decision-making processes. Incorporating stakeholders' and citizens' perspectives into renewable energy planning enhances the transparency, legitimacy, and acceptability of land-use decisions. The ability to visualise and quantitatively assess different scenarios makes PPGIS particularly useful for addressing the complexities of public debates on land-use requirements for renewable energy systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Public Policies for Renewable Energy: A Review of the Perspectives for a Circular Economy,"The development and implementation of public policies towards renewable energies are crucial in order to address the contemporary challenges faced by humanity. The 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle), as a circular economic practice, are often cited as one of the best solutions for sustainable development. Therefore, this study analyzed public policies for renewable energy from the perspective of the circular economy. Accordingly, a systematic review of the literature was carried out with respect to the beneficiaries and convergences of circularities, with a focus on public policies for renewable energies. The sample had public policies classified into three types (distributive, redistributive, and regulatory policies). The results showed that the first studies began in 1999, with a significant increase in publications during the 2010s, in which Germany was the country with the greatest contribution. The analyses associated with space showed the countries committed to the use of renewable energies and the 3Rs of the circular economy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The economic analyses revealed that the circular economy for the generation of renewable energy has a positive economic return in terms of social well-being and the mitigation of environmental degradation. There is a barrier to the circular economy's development posed by the cost of its implementation in the private sector and the resistance to raising awareness in society, requiring strong public sector engagement in decision making and the constant evaluation of public policies. It is concluded that the circular economy facilitates more efficient, productive structures and public policies, promoting alternatives for energy security and sustainability for the world energy matrix.",Not About Sufficiency
"Pursuing China's provincial sustainable development goals within a safe and just operating space: Past, present and future","As emphasized by the challenging sustainable development agenda, countries are facing a complicated combination of environmental stress and social challenges, leading the Earth system towards an unsustainable path. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately assess past fluctuations contributing to current situations and apprehend plausible future implications. This study integrates safe and just operating space (SJOS) with Sustainable Development Goals to depict multiple ""windows"" of environmental and social evolution in different historical periods, with 31 provinces in China as a case study. Then, we track the spatiotemporal evolution trajectory of environmental performance and social well-being in each province from 2012 to 2021. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is utilized to capture the temporal relationships between various indicators and to forecast the spatial trends of SJOS in the provinces from 2022 to 2030. Research findings indicate that: (1) over the 2012-2021 period, the environmental performance of the majority of provinces far exceeds the warning thresholds, with no province falling within all threshold boundaries simultaneously. The phosphorus cycle is the most challenging boundary, with only 6.8% of provinces within the safe boundary over the past 10 years. In comparison, freshwater use performs the best, with 80% of provinces staying within the threshold. (2) Social well-being generally improves across all provinces from 2012 to 2021, but the spatial and temporal trajectories are more varied. All provinces meet the thresholds for the food security and employment indicators. However, none of the provinces meet the standard for the social equity indicator. (3) Over the 2022-2030 projection period, environmental performance and social well-being trend in opposite directions across provinces. This culminates in no province being entirely within the safe and just space by 2030. Sanitation shows the most significant change compared to other indicators. Xinjiang had the largest improvement at 59.12%, while Tianjin had the most significant downward trend at 53.88%. Adjustments in national policies and priorities are essential if China wants to accomplish the sufficiency of biophysical resources whilst ensuring social equity in the access and exploitation of these resources.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying air quality co-benefits to industrial decarbonization: the local Air Emissions Tracking Atlas,"Introduction Many decarbonization technologies have the added co-benefit of reducing short-lived climate pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), creating a unique opportunity for identifying strategies that promote both climate change solutions and opportunities for air quality improvement. However, stakeholders and decision-makers may struggle to quantify how these co-benefits will impact public health for the communities most affected by industrial air pollution.Methods To address this problem, the LOCal Air Emissions Tracking Atlas (LOCAETA) fills a data availability and analysis gap by providing estimated air quality benefits from industrial decarbonization options, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). These co-benefits are calculated using an algorithm that connects disparate datasets that separately report greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants at U.S. industrial facilities.Results Version 1.0 of LOCAETA displays the estimated primary PM2.5 emission reduction co-benefits from additional pretreatment equipment for CCS on industrial and power facilities across the state of Louisiana, as well as the potential for VOC and NH3 generation. The emission reductions are presented in the tool alongside facility pollutant emissions information and relevant air quality, environmental, demographic, and public health datasets, such as air toxics cancer risk, satellite and in situ pollutant measurements, and population vulnerability metrics.Discussion LOCAETA enables regulators, policymakers, environmental justice communities, and industrial and commercial users to compare and contrast quantifiable public health benefits due to air quality impacts from various climate change mitigation strategies using a free and publicly-available tool. Additional pollutant reductions can be calculated using the same methodology and will be available in future versions of the tool.",Not About Sufficiency
Quantifying Social Justice in Energy Transition: A Policy-Driven Assessment Framework for China,"Addressing climate change and promoting social justice are crucial sustainable development goals. However, the quantitative assessment of how energy transition policies impact social justice remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we develop a novel Energy Transition Social Justice Framework (ETSJF) that integrates four dimensions (energy supply, energy demand, procedural justice, and distributive justice) and three perspectives (individual, group-organizational, and society). The ETSJF index is constructed to measure the progress of social justice in China's energy transition from 2010 to 2021. The index exhibits a robust growth trend, increasing from 269 in 2010 to 965 in 2021, with an average annual growth rate of 12.9%. The years 2014 and 2020-2021 mark turning points, coinciding with the implementation of transformative policy initiatives and China's carbon neutrality pledge. Employing multi-source data analysis, we evaluate the impact of energy transition policies on social justice using the Energy Transition Policy Impact Intensity (ETPII). Our analysis reveals that energy transition policies significantly positively impact overall social justice (ETPII: 1.133), with variations across dimensions. Energy supply shows the most potent effects (ETPII: 1.203), while procedural justice exhibits the weakest impact (ETPII: 0.804). These findings offer policy implications for achieving a just and inclusive energy transition. The proposed ETSJF and ETPII enable the systematic monitoring of social justice progress and offer methodological tools for policymakers to optimize energy transition policies through data-driven decision-making.",Not About Sufficiency
"Land Cover Change from National to Global Scales: A Spatiotemporal Assessment of Trajectories, Transitions and Drivers","Changes in global land cover (LC) have significant consequences for global environmental change, impacting the sustainability of biogeochemical cycles, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and food security. Different forms of LC change have taken place across the world in recent decades due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic drivers, however, the types of change and rates of change have traditionally been hard to quantify. This thesis exploits the properties of the recently released ESA-CCI-LC product – an internally consistent, high-resolution annual time-series of global LC extending from 1992 to 2018. Specifically, this thesis uses a combination of trajectories and transition maps to quantify LC changes over time at national, continental and global scales, in order to develop a deeper understanding of what, where and when significant changes in LC have taken place and relates these to natural and anthropogenic drivers. This thesis presents three analytical chapters that contribute to achieving the objectives and the overarching aim of the thesis. The first analytical chapter initially focuses on the Nile Delta region of Egypt, one of the most densely populated and rapidly urbanising regions globally, to quantify historic rates of urbanisation across the fertile agricultural land, before modelling a series of alternative futures in which these lands are largely protected from future urban expansion. The results show that 74,600 hectares of fertile agricultural land in the Nile Delta (Old Lands) was lost to urban expansion between 1992 and 2015. Furthermore, a scenario that encouraged urban expansion into the desert and adjacent to areas of existing high population density could be achieved, hence preserving large areas of fertile agricultural land within the Nile Delta. The second analytical chapter goes on to examine LC changes across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a complex and diverse environment, through the joint lenses of political regions and ecoregions, differentiating between natural and anthropogenic signals of change and relating to likely drivers. The results reveal key LC change processes at a range of spatial scales, and identify hotspots of LC change. The major five key LC change processes were: (i) “gain of dry forests” covered the largest extent and was distributed across the whole of SSA; (ii) “greening of deserts” found adjacent to desert areas (e.g., the Sahel belt); (iii) “loss of tree-dominated savanna” extending mainly across South-eastern Africa; (iv) “loss of shrub-dominated savanna” stretching across West Africa, and “loss of tropical rainforests” unexpectedly covering the smallest extent, mainly in the DRC, West Africa and Madagascar. The final analytical chapter considers LC change at the global scale, providing a comprehensive assessment of LC gains and losses, trajectories and transitions, including a complete assessment of associated uncertainties. This chapter highlights variability between continents and identifies locations of high LC dynamism, recognising global hotspots for sustainability challenges. At the national scale, the chapter identifies the top 10 countries with the largest percentages of forest loss and urban expansion globally. The results show that the majority of these countries have stabilised their forest losses, however, urban expansion was consistently on the rise in all countries. The thesis concludes with recommendations for future research as global LC products become more refined (spatially, temporally and thematically) allowing deeper insights into the causes and consequences of global LC change to be determined.",Not About Sufficiency
"Carbon Sequestration Potential of the Forest Ecosystems in the Western Ghats, a Global Biodiversity Hotspot","Global warming with the burgeoning anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (400 parts per million from 280 ppm CO2 emissions of pre-industrial era) has altered climate, eroding the ecosystem productivity and sustenance of water, affecting the livelihood of people. The anthropogenic activities such as burning fossil fuel, power generation, agriculture, industry, polluting water bodies and urban activities are responsible for increasing GHG footprint of which 72% constitute CO2. GHG footprint needs to be in balance with sequestration of carbon to sustain ecosystem functions. Forests are the major carbon sinks (about 45%) that aid in mitigating global warming. The current research focusses on the carbon budgeting through quantification of emissions and sinks in the forest ecosystems and changes in climatic conditions of Western Ghats. This would help in evolving appropriate mitigation strategies toward sustainable management of forests and mitigate impacts of global warming. The land-use land-cover (LULC) dynamics are the prime driver of climate change due to the loss of carbon sequestration potential as well as emissions. The Western Ghats are one among 36 global biodiversity hotspots and forests in this region sequester atmospheric carbon, which aid in moderating the global climate and sustaining water to ensure water and food security in the peninsular India. Assessment of LULC dynamics using temporal remote sensing data shows the decline of evergreen forest by 5% with an increase in agriculture, plantations and built-up area. The interior or intact forests have declined by 10%, and they are now confined to protected areas. The simulation of likely changes indicates that the region will have only 10% evergreen cover and 17% agriculture, 40% plantations and 5% built-up. Quantification of carbon reveals that the WG forest ecosystem holds 1.23 MGg (million gigagrams or Gt) in vegetation and soils. The annual incremental carbon is about 37,507.3 Gg, (or 37.5 million tons, Mt) and the highest in the forests of Karnataka part of WG. Simulation of the likely changes in carbon content indicates the loss of 0.23 MGg (2018–2031) carbon sequestration potential under business as usual scenario. The conservation scenario depicts an increase in carbon sequestration potential of WG forests with the protection. Sequestered carbon in WG is about INR 100 billion ($1.4 billion) at carbon trading of INR 2142 ($30) per tonne. Large-scale land-cover changes leading to deforestation has contributed to an increase in mean temperature by 0.5°C and decline in rainy days, which necessitates evolving prudent landscape management strategies involving all stakeholders for conservation of ecologically fragile WG. This will enhance the ability of forests to sequester atmospheric carbon and climate moderation, with the sustenance of ecosystem goods and services.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable development goal 12 and its synergies with other SDGs: identification of key research contributions and policy insights,"The relationships of SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) with other sustainable development goals (SDGs), both direct and indirect, necessitate a systematic analysis to understand its pivotal role in achieving other SDGs. This work focuses on a threefold investigation through a scientometric framework. Initially, the study sought to map and analyze the naturally formed linkages between SDG 12 and other SDGs by examining the literature specifically devoted to SDG 12, thereby revealing the SDGs that are strongly linked to SDG 12. The subsequent phase of the investigation identified prominent topics related to SDG 12 that require detailed exploration. Finally, the selected topics are mined through a methodical approach termed flow vergence gradient analysis, allowing for the revelation of significant contributions within each topic. Through the analysis of the SDG linkage map, SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), and SDG 15 (life on land), among others, were recognized as closely linked to SDG 12. Following this identification, five major topics—Industrial Symbiosis, Electronic waste, Carbon emissions, Life Cycle Assessment, and Green products—were deemed suitable for comprehensive mining to extract pivotal contributions. As policy recommendations, adopting a multifaceted approach to e-waste management and sustainable practices is imperative. Implementing consumption-based accounting (CBA) to achieve SDG 12 holistically will be useful. Businesses must align with circular economy principles, minimize hazardous materials, and adhere to low-emission, green supply chain practices. The emphasis is also on the need for proactive R&D collaboration with academia to meet SDG 12 targets, alongside engaging in community awareness through corporate social responsibility initiatives.",Not About Sufficiency

Rapid rise in urban sprawl: Global hotspots and trends since 1990,"Dispersed low-density development-""urban sprawl""-has many detrimental environmental, economic, and social consequences. Sprawl leads to higher greenhouse-gas emissions and poses an increasing threat to the long-term availability of many vital ecosystem services. Therefore, urban sprawl is in stark contradiction to the principles of sustainable land use and to the need for a sustainability transformation. This study presents the degree of urban sprawl on the planet at multiple spatial scales (continents, UN regions, countries, sub-national units, and a regular grid) for the period 1990-2014. Urban sprawl increased by 95% in 24 years, almost 4% per year, with built-up areas growing by almost 28 km(2) per day, or 1.16 km(2) per hour. The results demonstrate that Europe has been the most sprawled and also the most rapidly sprawling continent, by 51% since 1990. At the scale of UN regions, the highest relative increases in urban sprawl were observed in East Asia, Western Africa, and Southeast Asia. Urban sprawl per capita has been highest in Oceania and North America, exhibiting a minor decline since 1990, while it has been increasing rapidly in Europe, by almost 47% since 1990. The study revealed a strong relationship between urban sprawl and the level of human development as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI). The results suggest that it will be important for a more sustainable future to find a better balance between a high quality of life and using land more sparingly. There is an urgent need to stop urban sprawl, since current regulations and measures in developed countries are apparently not effective at limiting it. Monitoring urban sprawl can serve to guide policy development such as the implementation of targets and limits and to evaluate the effectiveness of urban growth management strategies at mitigating urban sprawl.",Not About Sufficiency
Analysing and Predicting the Geospatial Transformation of the Rural-Urban Fringe of Delhi Region in India,"This research aims to understand the long-term, large-scale geospatial transformation of the rural-urban fringe of Delhi, a megacity in India. Globalisation coupled with industrialisation has triggered the urban growth in this rural-urban fringe in an unsustainable and unplanned manner. This unchecked growth results in vast land use land cover transformation, which impacts urban and surrounding rural-urban fringe areas. Such unorganised developments result in environmental degradation, spatial fragmentation, and loss of identity of the fringe. This is a critical challenge for Delhi which is poised to become the largest urban agglomeration in the world, with a population of nearly 43 million by 2035. The existing scholarships have mostly assessed Delhi within its administrative limits but failed to analyse and establish its rural-urban structure, land use and its relationship with the emerging cities in its vicinity.This thesis takes a quantitative approach and utilises current advancements in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing. The study area spans across three states and eighteen districts, covering an area of over 16700 km2. The geospatial analysis is carried out across four main stages. First, a retrospective approach is taken to understand the land use transformation in the last thirty years (1990-2020) across five land use classes (water, vegetation, built-up, agriculture, barren). Second, exploratory spatial analysis is conducted to understand its rural-urban structure, connectivity with the fringe and spatial metrics of the landscape. Third, a predictive urban growth model is created till the year 2040 to understand the future land use scenarios and their impact on the fringe. Fourth, a long-term environmental performance analysis (2001-2020) across four key environmental indices (NDVI, precipitation, evapotranspiration, land surface temperature) is conducted to assess their influence on each other and their impact due to rapid urban growth. In this process, the research also conducts an exploratory literature review to understand and highlight the global and the Indian perspective on the rural-urban fringe study.This thesis presents new knowledge by conducting up to date and in-depth geospatial analysis of Delhi beyond its administrative limits. The study renews the focus on the rural-urban fringe and explores its vulnerability and potential as a space with its own identity. The research also establishes that Delhi cannot be studied in isolation anymore, and its growth is very much dependent on its surrounding areas, which are rapidly expanding. The methodology of this thesis is fully scalable and can be utilised to study similar cities and megacities globally. This research, at a broader level, extends the present debate on sustainable urban development and contributes to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities.",Not About Sufficiency
Re-imagining the driver-pressure-state-impact-response framework from an equity and inclusive development perspective,"The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework has been used by environmental agencies and others to assess environmental challenges and policy responses. However, in doing so, social justice or equity issues tend to come as an afterthought, while there is evidence that environmental challenges and policy responses are not equity (including gender-) neutral. Hence, this paper addresses the question: why should, and how can, equity issues and environmental justice be incorporated into the DPSIR framework? It presents a structure for including equity within DPSIR and applies it. It reviews the literature to bring together data that demonstrates that there is a clear equity perspective along the entire DPSIR analysis. It concludes that although individual environmental policies may succeed to achieve their specific goal in the short term; if they ignore the equity aspects, the policy strategies as a whole are likely to be environmentally unjust, and lead to exclusive and unsustainable development, which, in turn, could further exacerbate environmental challenges. This highlights the need for an integrated approach in efforts to achieve environmentally sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency

Recycling Carbon Tax under Different Energy Efficiency Improvements: A CGE Analysis of China,"Carbon emission reductions and sustainable development have become hot issues in international conferences. As the most direct instrument for carbon emission reductions, the carbon tax has not been favored by policymakers because of its negative effect on the economy. To achieve low-carbon sustainable development, we use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate carbon tax recycling under different energy transfer efficiency improvements to achieve triple dividends of carbon emission reductions and social welfare improvement. This paper contributes to the literature on recycling carbon tax for triple dividends in China. The simulation has three main findings: (i) the carbon tax revenue recycling toward reducing the resident income tax rate yields triple dividends without any energy transfer efficiency improvement; (ii) the losses of GDP and social welfare are exaggerated. Meanwhile, the carbon tax brings down carbon emissions and total carbon intensity of GDP with a mild impact on the Chinese economy; (iii) the improvement of energy transfer efficiency demonstrates the advantages of recycling carbon tax and is essential for achieving triple dividends. Thus, we propose the following policy recommendations: (i) the pilot carbon tax mechanism should be launched in high-carbon sectors (such as coal) and then implemented in other industries gradually; (ii) the government should strongly support the technological improvement of energy transfer efficiency in order to achieve sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Recycling scheme of carbon pricing for inclusive decarbonization and energy transition: A recursive computable general equilibrium analysis in China,"Revenue recycling is crucial for carbon pricing to achieve inclusive decarbonization and energy transition. Several studies have documented carbon pricing recycling, but few focused on mixed recycling schemes that allocate revenues across multiple institutions. To fill this knowledge gap, we employ a newly developed recursive computable general equilibrium model to explore the socioeconomic consequences of various recycling schemes in the context of China. We find that: (1) Although carbon pricing promotes renewable energy, it adversely affects social welfare and urban-rural equality. When executing the recycling scheme, this negative effect is alleviated. (2) All single recycling scenarios fail to yield a double dividend. They remain detrimental to social welfare and urban-rural equality. (3) Despite small welfare loss, a moderate-share renewables-based mixed recycling scheme reduces urban-rural inequality while favoring decarbonization and energy transition.

Recycling Waste Plastic: An Implementation of the Circular Economy Principles or Just Pollution Shift,"As the demand for plastics increases, the international plastic waste trade has grown steeply during the last decades. Different studies have identified that plastic waste frequently travels from developed to developing/underdeveloped countries posing environmental burdens on them turning the issue into an environmental justice debate denoting the unequal distribution of social and environmental costs. With the recent implementation of China's waste import bans, different countries such as Turkey have become importers of large amounts of waste. From a Circular Economy (CE) perspective, this trade could be classified as an implementation of 9R principles, particularly in plastic recycling. However, the rapid change in waste flows in Turkey and the lack of waste management infrastructures have generated several problems in the economic, environmental, and social spheres of sustainability. Against this background, this paper analyses the plastic waste trade by employing a combined SWOT/ANP method to highlight the most important factors to reach an environmentally just recycling practice in line with the CE principles. After determining the main factors of the problem, a set of possible strategies were identified and evaluated. Preliminary findings indicate that mainstream practices i.e. recycling and reuse, are frequently classified as insufficient to reach a CE model that embraces an environmental justice perspective. Unless these approaches consider the matter holistically, material recovery ends up in shifting pollution to other countries, promoting a circular washing cycle and preventing the achievement of real sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency

Refocusing ecosystem services towards sustainability,"Ecosystem services and sustainability have become prominent concepts in international policy and research agendas. However, a common conceptual ground between these concepts is currently underdeveloped. In particular, a vision is missing on how to align ecosystem services with overarching sustainability goals. Originally, the ecosystem service concept focused on sustaining human well-being through biodiversity conservation. Nevertheless, studies within the field also consider appropriation beyond carrying capacities, and natural resource management that involves environmentally damaging inputs as ecosystem service provision. This brings the ecosystem service concept into conflict with the core goal of sustainability, i.e. achieving justice within ecological limits over the long term. Here, we link the ecosystem service concept to sustainability outcomes operationalized in terms of justice. Our framing positions sustainability as an overarching goal which can be achieved through seven key strategies: equitable (1) intergenerational and (2) intragenerational distribution, (3) interspecies distribution, (4) fair procedures, recognition and participation, (5) sufficiency, (6) efficiency, and (7) persistence. Applying these strategies has the potential to re-focus the ecosystem service concept towards the normative goal of sustainability. We identify research needs for each strategy and further discuss questions regarding operationalization of the strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",Not About Sufficiency
Regional green total factor performance analysis of China's construction industry based on a unified framework combining static and dynamic indexes,"It has an important meaning to improve green total factor performance in the construction industry for China's green and high-quality development. In addition to the traditional desirable economic output and undesirable CO2 emission output, the indicators representing social welfare of China's construction industry were incorporated into the total factor framework. On this basis, a global non-radial DEA approach was employed to explore the sources and the key factors leading to changes in regional green total factor performance of China's construction industry from both static and dynamic perspectives. The results were concluded as follows: (1) The lower energy efficiency and CO2 emission efficiency were the main reasons for low level of green total factor efficiency. During the sample period, energy efficiency increased rapidly while capital efficiency remained almost unchanged. (2) The green total factor productivity demonstrated an increasing trend, which was driven by technological progress rather than technical efficiency. An in-depth decomposition revealed that the deterioration of technical efficiency was mainly caused by the negative effect of CO2 emissions. (3) Regional green total factor performance of China's construction industry demonstrated obvious spatial heterogeneity. Each province should comprehensively consider its own characteristics of green development in the construction industry to formulate the corresponding optimization strategy. These findings can help decision makers design specific policies on regional-oriented green development of China's construction industry.",Not About Sufficiency

We quantized the spatial distribution structure of five land use types including agricultural land, industrial land, residential and commercial land, traffic land, and other land through applying spatial Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient. Then the corresponding energy-related carbon emissions in each type of land were calculated in the study period. Through building the reasonable regression models, we found that the concentration degree of industrial land is negatively correlated with carbon emission intensity in the long term, whereas the concentration degree is positively correlated with carbon emission intensity in agricultural land, residential and commercial land, traffic land, and other land. The results also indicate that land use spatial distribution structure affects carbon emission intensity more intensively than energy efficiency and production efficiency do. These conclusions provide valuable reference to develop comprehensive policies for energy conservation and carbon emission reduction in a new perspective.",Not About Sufficiency

"Renewable energy market in Africa: Opportunities, progress, challenges, and future prospects","The transition to renewable energy is crucial for addressing Africa's rising energy demand while fostering sustainable development. With abundant renewable resources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and biomass, Africa is uniquely positioned to play a key role in the global low carbon energy transition. This study investigates the role of renewable energy in supporting Africa's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and its alignment with the Paris Agreement's climate goals. Using a combination of empirical methodologies, including market analysis and cost-benefit evaluations, we assess the potential of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, alleviate energy poverty, and promote economic growth. Our findings show that harnessing just 25 % of Africa's renewable energy potential could significantly reduce energy poverty, contributing to a sustainable, low-carbon future. Furthermore, we highlights the declining costs of renewable energy technologies, driven by innovation, economies of scale, and market dynamics, making renewable energy increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources. This has led to lower consumer energy prices, improved market attractiveness, and enhanced profitability for renewable energy investments. By examining the socio-economic impacts of renewable energy adoption, the study provides key insights into the market dynamics, investment potential, and policy implications for accelerating Africa's renewable energy transition.

One strategy promoting renewable energy growth is to enhance cross-border electricity trade (CBET). In addition to addressing intermittency and reliability issues, CBET offers a larger market for the renewable energy. The paper tests these hypotheses and finds considerable empirical support for the same. A clear causal linkage has been found from CBET to renewable energy generation. We have applied nonparametric regression to establish the association between CBET and renewable energy generation. The method is less restrictive in the sense that no a priori functional form is assumed for the sought relationship. Having established the affirmative role of CBET in boosting renewable energy generation, we advocate for concerted policy intervention by trading partners to overcome the barriers promoting CBET. This should help in achieving sustainable development goal of affordable and sustainable energy for all.",Not About Sufficiency
Renewable energy transition and regional integration: Energizing the pathway to sustainable development,"This study examines the influence of renewable energy transition on sustainable development, with multidimensional regional integration as a moderator. Using various regression techniques, a balanced panel dataset was analyzed for 64 countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and three sub-regions (Asia, Europe, and Middle East-Africa) from 2005 to 2020. The findings reveal a positive relationship between renewable energy transition and sustainable development across the full panel and sub-regions of the BRI. Multidimensional regional integration also positively influences sustainable development. The interaction of regional integration with renewable energy transitions positively moderates sustainable development in Asia and Europe but negatively in the Middle East-African economies. Macroeconomic conditions, institutional quality, and population size positively affect sustainable development for the full panel, with mixed effects in sub-regions. Conversely, government consumption negatively impacts sustainable development for both the full and regional panels of the BRI. This study underscores important policy implications for promoting a balanced transition from conventional energy sources to renewables, thereby fostering green economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion.",Not About Sufficiency
Renewables but unjust? Critical restoration geography as a framework for addressing global renewable energy injustice,"A global transition toward a sustainable energy system, incorporating for example Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs), is essential for decarbonizing electricity production, meeting energy demands, and mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, the growing scale of renewable energy development has exacerbated local environmental and social challenges; improper assessment of RETs has led to recorded conflicts and resource injustice in transitioning communities. The purpose of this study is to analyze global cases of renewable energy development resulting in conflict and environmental injustice, and to propose Critical Restoration Geography (CRG) as a framework strategizing for pre-emptive avoidance of RET-related injustices. Evidence of global environmental injustice in RET development was explored using recorded conflicts from the Global Atlas of Environmental Justice (EJAtlas). We synthesized global variations in affected demographics, land area and conflict resolution with respect to achievement of environmental justice by RET type (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal). Based on analysis of GEJA's 102 recorded cases of RET-related environmental (in)justice from 2001 to 2021, justice was either not achieved or ambiguous in 55 and 20 cases. Drivers for these injustices include displacement of Indigenous communities, exclusion of communities from decision making processes, and protection of business interests over biodiversity and community needs. The proposed CRG framework details seven principles for avoiding environmental injustice in global RET development; including recognition and deconstruction of power dynamics, incorporation of multiple knowledge systems, and promotion of social justice. These principles serve to inform environmentally just approaches to policymaking for future RET development in any geographical context.",Not About Sufficiency
Repair for a Broken Economy: Lessons for Circular Economy from an International Interview Study of Repairers,"The idea of replacing the broken linear economy with circular forms to help address the current sustainability crisis is gaining world-wide traction in policy, industry, and academia. This article presents results from an international interview study with 34 repair practitioners and experts in different fields. The article aims to improve understandings of the potential of repair so as to contribute to a more just, sustainable, and circular economy. Through a five-step qualitative method the results reveal and explore three tensions inherent in repair: first, repair activities constitute different forms of subjectivity; second, repair entails different and sometimes contested temporalities; and finally, even though repair is deeply political in practice, the politics of repair are not always explicit, and some repair activities are actively depoliticized. The opportunities and obstacles embodied in these tensions are generative in repair practices and debates, but poorly reflected in contemporary circular economy discourse. We conclude that a richer, more inclusive, and politicized understanding of repair can support environmental justice in the implementation of circular economy (CE) and provide greater opportunities for just and transformational sustainability strategies and policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Research on multi-stage strategy of low carbon building material's production by small and medium-sized manufacturers: A three-party evolutionary game analysis,"Using green technology by building materials manufacturers to produce low-carbon building materials is an effective way to control carbon emissions and promote traditional industries' green and low-carbon development. Based on the government, small and medium-sized building materials manufacturers, and scientific research institutes, this paper sets 15 variables that affect the strategy selection of game participants, establishes an evolutionary game model under the constraint of the carbon tax, explores the behavioral strategies of the three parties in the industry life cycle to produce low-carbon building materials, and analyzes the sensitivity of critical factors. Results: The government plays a leading role in the initial stage, which is gradually replaced by the market-leading mechanism as the low-carbon building materials industry develops to maturity. The government's decision-making behavior is almost unaffected by the two, and appropriate subsidies and carbon tax penalties at each stage of the industry life cycle can help improve the enthusiasm of the other two parties to participate in low-carbon behavior. Establishing a reasonable income distribution coefficient between small and medium-sized building materials manufacturers and scientific research institutes is more conducive to speeding up the stable state than transferring and selling technology.",Not About Sufficiency
Resilience of and through urban ecosystem services,"Cities and urban areas are critical components of global sustainability as loci of sustainability progress and drivers of global transformation, especially in terms of energy efficiency, climate change adaptation, and social innovation. However, urban ecosystems have not been incorporated adequately into urban governance and planning for resilience despite mounting evidence that urban resident health and wellbeing is closely tied to the quality, quantity, and diversity of urban ecosystem services. We suggest that urban ecosystem services provide key links for bridging planning, management and governance practices seeking transitions to more sustainable cities, and serve an important role in building resilience in urban systems. Emerging city goals for resilience should explicitly incorporate the value of urban ES in city planning and governance. We argue that cities need to prioritize safeguarding of a resilient supply of ecosystem services to ensure livable, sustainable cities, especially given the dynamic nature of urban systems continually responding to global environmental change. Building urban resilience of and through ecosystem services, both in research and in practice, will require dealing with the dynamic nature of urban social-ecological systems and incorporating multiple ways of knowing into governance approaches to resilience including from scientists, practitioners, designers and planners.

Resource Recovery from Waste: Restoring the Balance between Resource Scarcity and Waste Overload,"Current societal patterns of production and consumption drive a twin environmental crisis of resource scarcity and waste overload. Positioning waste and resource management in the context of ecosystem stewardship, this article relates increasing resource demand and waste production to the violation of planetary boundaries and human rights. We argue that a transition towards a circular economy (CE) that contributes to a resilient environment and human well-being is necessary to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The transition requires scientific and technological progress, including the development of low-energy biogeochemical technologies for resource recovery, and multi-dimensional value assessment tools integrating environmental, social, and economic factors. While the urgency to adopt a CE is well-recognised, progress has been slow. Coordinated change is required from multiple actors across society. Academia can contribute through participatory action research. This article concludes with the participation strategy of the Resource Recovery from Waste programme, aiming for changes in mentality, industry practices, and policies and regulations in the waste and resource management landscape in the UK.",Not About Sufficiency

"Revisiting the environmental impact of renewable energy, non-renewable energy, remittances, and economic growth: CO2 emissions versus ecological footprint for top remittance-receiving countries","The study examined the impact of renewable energy, non-renewable energy, remittances, and economic growth on environmental degradation from the perspective of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) and ecological footprint for the top 50 remittance-receiving countries for 1991-2018. This study simulates the environmental future for attaining the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) using the latest datasets. This study is one of the few that empirically explores how various explanatory variables affect CO2 and ecological footprint. The study employed the pool mean group autoregressive distributive lag (PMG-ARDL), fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) techniques for the analysis. In the long-run, non-renewable energy and economic growth have a positive impact, whereas renewable energy and remittances have a negative impact on CO2 and ecological footprint. The impact of non-renewable energy on CO2 and ecological footprint is more significant than renewable energy in both the short- and long-run. Most of the variables have a bidirectional causality among each other. This highlights the need for a paradigm shift towards renewable energy in the top recipients specifically for developing countries.",Not About Sufficiency
CO2 emissions from passenger transport in Rio de Janeiro,"Transport externalities have generally been discussed at the local level perspective. Aspects related to local atmospheric and noise pollution from vehicles, for instance, have been analysed in great depth and their impact in urban centres has been studied and discussed. On the other hand, some aspects related to the wider contribution of transport to environmental impacts have been neglected or considered of less importance. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate how urban passenger transport contributes to CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions and to the greenhouse effect. The study takes into account road transport emissions in the Metropolitan Region of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro, focusing on the comparison between urban bus emissions and private car emissions. The conclusions reached highlight some viable transport policies to be adopted in the city and the importance of increasing public transport use if CO2 emissions from traffic are to be reduced. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",Not About Sufficiency
"Climate variability, climate change and social vulnerability in the semi-arid tropics","Climate fluctuations can trigger events that lead to mass migration, hunger and famine. Rather than attributing the blame to nature, the authors look at the underlying causes of social vulnerability, such as social processes and organization. Past and present susceptibility to destitution, hunger, and famine in the face of climate variability can teach us about the potential future consequences of climate change. By understanding why individuals, households, nations and regions are vulnerable, and how they have buffered themselves against climatic and environmental fluctuations, present and future vulnerability can be redressed. Through case studies from around the globe, the authors explore past experiences with climate variability, as well as the likely effects of, and the possible policy responses to, the types of climatic events that global warming might bring. -Editors",Not About Sufficiency
Is there a trade-off between human well-being and ecological footprint in European countries?,"Human development, which encompasses aspects such as health, education, standard of living, and general well-being, is intrinsically linked to environmental sustainability. Studying the trade-off between these two aspects helps ensure that current needs are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The present study aims to understand whether there is a trade-off between the Ecological Footprint (EF) and the Human Development Index (HDI), using data from 42 European countries from 2006 to 2018. Other variables were also employed (Financial Development Index, Globalization Index, Human Freedom Index, Urban Population, Biocapacity, Renewable Energy) in two main models, through several econometric tests (Interactive Fixed Effects, Common Correlated Effect Mean Group). Other models were estimated for robustness checks. It is concluded that there is a trade-off between the EF and the HDI. This leads to problems when trying to achieve human well-being and environmental sustainability simultaneously. This study is innovative as the relationship between human development and environmental degradation has not been analyzed using these two variables for European countries. Understanding the relationship between human development and EF is fundamental to developing effective policies.

Population and relevant issues of the present social agenda,"Various mechanisms implicated in the interaction between population and the environment involve different demographic variables (population size, growth, and spatial distribution). Three factors were analyzed as they correlate to population: the environment, education, and decentralization. Mechanisms of interaction were identified and debated. One mechanism is related to the magnitude of population and the other is related to the rhythm of demographic increase. The geographic concentration of the population, as well as production and consumption, are other factors exerting a demographic influence on the environment. Migration also constitutes a relevant population-environment interaction mechanism both in urban and rural areas. The directions of policies on population, development, and the environment were also specified. Focus was centered on the market, fixed resources, inequality and dependence, and population as an intermediate variable. Population, development, and the environment were examined with methodological instruments and their use for policies: the impact of population, affluence, and technology (carrying capacity, environmental impact assessments). The basic interrelations of population and education relate to the impact of population trends on the demand for education, consequences of demographic trends on the educational conditions of the population (fertility and the composition of households), and the effects of changes in education on population variables. Instruments for the operative integration of population variables into educational policies and programs comprise: estimation methods and projection models of educational requirements; education as the inducer of sociodemographic behavior; the calibration of the impact of internal and international migration; and the role of local government. Aspects of population, decentralization, and public administration involve: decentralization and spatial distribution of the population; sociodemographic policies and decentralization; population, equity, and decentralization; population, decentralization, and the environment; and population, decentralization, and transformation of production.",Not About Sufficiency
Role of water-energy-food nexus in environmental management and climate action,"The demand for water, energy, and food resources increased in tandem with the world's population, industrialization, and urbanization. Anthropogenic sources of environmental pollutants degrade the water resources while population expansion contributes to rising demand for non-renewable energy resources which further enhances the greenhouse gas emissions. Also, maintaining the food security/-safety is another challenge which needs to be addressed for securing 'planetary public health'. The sustainability programs, pragmatic studies, and strategies from regulatory/scientific institutions attempt to reduce the depletion of these resources and mitigate environmental challenges however, the individualistic approaches proves to be inadequate. Therefore, the present review emphasizes the use of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus as a tool to combat environmental degradation, address climate action, and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we investigate methodological paradigm and application of WEF Nexus in an inter-related framework through case studies on water resources, energy efficiency, urban food production, food waste reduction, cross-sectoral perspectives, and the circular economy. It has been widely observed that excessive exploitation of these resources influences the global food supply and demand, water availability, resilience in energy and socio-economic sector. Also, such perturbations in water, energy, and food sectors were found to be inextricably linked with climate change. The results further revealed that WEF nexus approach stimulates multilevel and inter-sectoral governance, thereby aiding to address the complexities and inefficiencies in achieving the SDGs. The prioritization of WEF Nexus strategy, especially under the event of COVID-19 can be a holistic approach to sustainably utilise natural resources to help achieve the environmental sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Safe and just operating spaces for regional social-ecological systems,"Humanity faces a major global challenge in achieving wellbeing for all, while simultaneously ensuring that the biophysical processes and ecosystem services that underpin wellbeing are exploited within scientifically informed boundaries of sustainability. We propose a framework for defining the safe and just operating space for humanity that integrates social wellbeing into the original planetary boundaries concept (Rockstrom et al., 2009a,b) for application at regional scales. We argue that such a framework can: (1) increase the policy impact of the boundaries concept as most governance takes place at the regional rather than planetary scale; (2) contribute to the understanding and dissemination of complexity thinking throughout governance and policy-making; (3) act as a powerful metaphor and communication tool for regional equity and sustainability. We demonstrate the approach in two rural Chinese localities where we define the safe and just operating space that lies between an environmental ceiling and a social foundation from analysis of time series drawn from monitored and palaeoecological data, and from social survey statistics respectively. Agricultural intensification has led to poverty reduction, though not eradicated it, but at the expense of environmental degradation. Currently, the environmental ceiling is exceeded for degraded water quality at both localities even though the least well-met social standards are for available piped water and sanitation. The conjunction of these social needs and environmental constraints around the issue of water access and quality illustrates the broader value of the safe and just operating space approach for sustainable development.

Socioeconomic Impacts of Climate Mitigation Actions in Greece: Quantitative Assessment and Public Perception,"Appropriately designed and implemented climate mitigation actions have multiple co-benefits (yet some trade-offs cannot be excluded) that result in substantial social and economic value beyond their direct impact on reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions. Despite their wider acknowledgement by the research community, decision makers and the public have incomplete information on these multiple effects. This paper has a twofold objective: First, through analytical bottom-up approaches, it assesses, in quantitative terms, the macroeconomic effects and the public health benefits attributed to a variety of mitigation actions under consideration in the context of the Greek Energy and Climate Plan. Second, it investigates, through a social survey, how citizens perceive climate change and value these multiple impacts of mitigation actions, and to what extent they are willing to pay for them and support the adoption of policy measures aiming at the green transition of the Greek economy. We show that mitigation actions bring about significant health benefits, particularly in cities, and generate significant positive macroeconomic effects, particularly if mitigation actions focus on the decarbonization of the building sector and on the exploitation of local renewable sources. We also argue that most people do not realize that climate mitigation actions can have wider benefits for society, such as tackling energy poverty, improving public health, and creating new jobs. Unwillingness to pay tends to be the prominent attitude. People who are more reluctant to cover a part of the cost of environmental protection are less likely to perceive that climate change is one of the main challenges at global and national level and support the adoption of climate mitigation policies. In this context, the national strategy for climate change should focus on effectively informing and engaging the public in climate mitigation strategies, strengthening the public trust in government institutions, promoting mutually acceptable solutions with the local communities, and providing incentives for changing citizens’ behavior towards climate-related actions.",Not About Sufficiency
Economy and schemes of recurrence: Sustainability as an economic and ethical value,"Sustainability has become an important catch-word in several fields that has stimulated an important body of work on a wide variety of topics ranging from economic development and agricultural production to social equity and biodiversity. Few generalizations can be made about such a diverse body of work. However, one can say with some confidence that this reflection has come about in large part from a sense that certain activities constitute a threat to human well-being through the destruction of the necessary conditions of human survival. This fact has contributed to a rampant pessimism regarding prospects for the future and a rethinking of the meaning of sustainability in the fields noted above. However, acknowledging that sustainability is a rich concept in current thinking about economy, environment, and ecology does not mean that it is clearly understood. Indeed, the opposite is true. For example, John Pezzey, in a recent World Bank study, identified twenty-seven definitions of sustainability. Even a summary survey of the work about sustainability shows that the term is a multidimensional concept that comprises of a number of interrelated elements, including ecological, environmental, economic, technological, social, cultural, ethical, and political dimensions. © 1996, MCB UP Limited",Not About Sufficiency

Scalar Containment of Energy Justice and Its Democratic Discontents: Solar Power and Energy Poverty Alleviation,"The threats climate change poses require rapid and wide decarbonization efforts in the energy sector. Historically, large-scale energy operations, often instrumental for a scaled and effective approach to meet decarbonization goals, undergird energy-related injustices. Energy poverty is a multi-dimensional form of injustice, with relevance to low-carbon energy transitions. Defined as the condition of being unable to access an adequate level of household energy services, energy poverty persists despite the emergence of affordable renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaics (PV). Historical injustices and the modularity of solar PV combine to offer new possibilities in ownership, production and distribution of cost-competitive, clean and collectively scalable energy. Consequently, emerging policy priorities for positive energy districts call into question the traditional large-scale modality of energy operations. We report from a case study of solar power in Lisbon, a frontrunner in urban energy transitions while also home to high energy poverty incidence. The study focuses on scalar aspects of justice in energy transitions to investigate whether and how solar PV can alleviate urban energy poverty. It features 2 months of fieldwork centered on community and expert perspectives, including semi-structured interviews and field observations. We mobilize a spatial energy justice framework to identify justice aspects of multi-scalar solar PV uptake. By showing how energy justice is shaped in diverse ways at different scales, we demonstrate ways in which scale matters for just urban energy transitions. We argue that small- and medium-scaled approaches to electricity distribution, an integral component of positive energy districts, can address specific justice concerns. However, even as such approaches gain attention and legitimacy, they risk structurally excluding socio-economically vulnerable users, and proceed slowly relative to large-scale solar rollout.",Not About Sufficiency

"Harry Stobbs Memorial Lecture, 1997 Rethinking high input systems of livestock production: A case study of nitrogen emissions in Dutch dairy farming","Livestock are essential in many farming systems where they provide income, food and power, or where they enhance soil fertility or the socioeconomic situation of farmers. However, livestock can also cause environmental degradation, pollution and social inequality. The contradiction between these views lies in differences between production systems, here called modes of agriculture. This paper starts, therefore, by giving a classification of livestock systems as a framework to rethink the role of livestock in high-input agriculture. The classification explains what is meant by high-input systems by placing them in a sequence of modes in agriculture that each face sustainability problems in different ways. Secondly, the paper discusses negative effects of livestock in high-input systems by zooming in on nitrogen surpluses in dairy farming of the Netherlands. It then elaborates ways to cope with these problems by distinguishing between linear and dynamic aspects. Linear aspects refer to reductionist approaches like other methods of feeding, housing and/or manure application. Dynamic aspects refer to holistic approaches which acknowledge that an intervention in one part of the system affects the functioning of the system elsewhere. Examples of practical and administrative measures regarding the rethinking of high-input systems are elaborated.",Not About Sufficiency

How the circular economy can revive the Sustainable Development Goals,"With progress on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) badly off track, international policymakers are scrambling for solutions that can both revitalize the current SDG agenda and drive more effective action on humanity’s big challenges in the future. The ‘circular economy’ offers clear potential in this area. This wide-ranging concept, which involves making economies less wasteful and less resource-intensive while contributing to human development and well-being, could hold the key to accelerating SDG delivery. A more formal role within the SDGs and any emerging post-2030 successor regime would also provide a catalyst for expansion of the circular economy itself. This paper explores how the circular economy could support each of the 17 SDGs, and argues for the concept to be put at the heart of emerging plans to drive sustainable development towards 2050. Doing so could help to foster resilient economies, reduce environmental impacts and ensure equitable resource distribution. The paper identifies five priorities for action: embedding principles of justice and inclusivity into the circular transition; increasing international policy coordination; reforming the financial architecture to ensure the circular economy gets the investment it needs; rewiring the global system of trade to make it easier to trade circular products and services; and developing common standards and metrics.",Not About Sufficiency

"Solid waste characteristics and management strategies at ST Theresa (STT) and Holy Cross (HC) hospitals in Chirumanzu rural District, Zimbabwe","Management of solid waste from rural hospitals is among major problems affecting developing countries. This is mostly attributed to inadequate data related to quantity and quality of hospital solid waste. Similarly, information related to rural hospital solid waste characteristics and management is limited in Zimbabwe. However, SDGs complemented by Zimbabwe Vision 2030, NDS 1 advocates for sustainable solid waste management. Hence, enough data related to characteristics of solid waste from rural hospitals are required to attain sustainability. This research focuses on hospital solid waste characteristics and management strategies at STT and HC rural hospitals. Descriptive cross sectional research design which triangulates qualitative and quantitative paradigms was utilized. Interviews, observations, questionnaires were used to collect data. Quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences whereas qualitative data were subjected to content analysis. Solid waste generated at STT encompasses non-hazardous (77.35%), hazardous waste (22.65%). At HC solid waste consists of non-hazardous (79%) and hazardous waste (21%). Respondents at STT (70.4%) and HC (72.7%) noted that solid waste was increasing. Solid waste was increasing due to various factors namely high use of disposable materials at HC (35.1%), STT (42.5%) and increase of patients at HC (30%) and STT (29.7%). Solid waste was indiscriminately stored in various types of containers although pedal operated bins and sharp containers were highly used at STT (72.4%) and HC (69.1%). Waste receptacles were transported to disposal sites using wheelbarrows and manual handling. Open pits and burning were among disposal strategies but incineration was regarded as the golden approach at STT (44.8%) and HC (41.8%). Inappropriate hospital solid waste management was due to shortage of finance at STT (38.1%) and HC (30.9%) and unawareness among health workers.

Quantifying Social Justice in Energy Transition: A Policy-Driven Assessment Framework for China,"Addressing climate change and promoting social justice are crucial sustainable development goals. However, the quantitative assessment of how energy transition policies impact social justice remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we develop a novel Energy Transition Social Justice Framework (ETSJF) that integrates four dimensions (energy supply, energy demand, procedural justice, and distributive justice) and three perspectives (individual, group-organizational, and society). The ETSJF index is constructed to measure the progress of social justice in China’s energy transition from 2010 to 2021. The index exhibits a robust growth trend, increasing from 269 in 2010 to 965 in 2021, with an average annual growth rate of 12.9%. The years 2014 and 2020–2021 mark turning points, coinciding with the implementation of transformative policy initiatives and China’s carbon neutrality pledge. Employing multi-source data analysis, we evaluate the impact of energy transition policies on social justice using the Energy Transition Policy Impact Intensity (ETPII). Our analysis reveals that energy transition policies significantly positively impact overall social justice (ETPII: 1.133), with variations across dimensions. Energy supply shows the most potent effects (ETPII: 1.203), while procedural justice exhibits the weakest impact (ETPII: 0.804). These findings offer policy implications for achieving a just and inclusive energy transition. The proposed ETSJF and ETPII enable the systematic monitoring of social justice progress and offer methodological tools for policymakers to optimize energy transition policies through data-driven decision-making.",Not About Sufficiency
Shared and environmentally just responsibility for global biodiversity loss,"Human land use is the main driver of terrestrial biodiversity loss. It has been argued that producers and consumers have a shared responsibility for biodiversity loss because this land use is directly and indirectly driven by the local and global demand for products. Such responsibility sharing would be an important step for global biodiversity cooperation and conservation. Here, we use a global multiregional input-output framework to estimate consumption-based biodiversity loss, integrating with both the physical Food and Agriculture Biomass Input-Output (FABIO) dataset and a global monetary input-output table (EXIOBASE). We use an environmental justice framework for assigning biodiversity loss responsibility between producers and consumers. In this framework, we employ the Human Development Index (HDI) as a proxy of the weighting parameter for both producers and consumers. An environmental justice perspective may provide a fairer distribution of responsibility in a world where different nations have very different capabilities and see varying benefits from international trade. Environmentally just accounting increases the footprint of the Global North compared to other common approaches for sharing responsibility across all producers and consumers along international supply chains. We describe how environmental justice may inform cooperation in biodiversity protection between stakeholders along global supply chains.",Not About Sufficiency

The study was founded upon an extensive examination of scientific literature and a thorough analysis of prior studies. This approach facilitated the evaluation of the potential consequences of these factors on the environment. Quantitative data analysis was employed as the primary approach, utilizing regression modeling to ascertain the correlation between the degree of inclusion and the adoption of circular economy practices. This analysis further facilitated the identification of any alterations in the level of ecological threat. Additionally, the use of taxonomy allowed determining the level of ecological threaten, while cluster analysis was used to distribute territories based on the level of ecological threaten ecocide. Factor analysis was utilized to gain insights into the impact of circular economy practices and inclusion on ecological risks, while regression analysis was employed to validate the research hypotheses. FINDINGS: The study demonstrates integrating circular economy principles with active community engagement significantly mitigates ecological threats in wartime rural Ukraine, achieving a 45 percent risk reduction. Direct positive impact of circular economy practices and inclusivity on environmental health, marking a 30 percent ecological improvement, was discovered. Innovations and inclusive practices have been found to significantly enhance biodiversity, resulting in a remarkable 25 percent increase. Additionally, these advancements have also been observed to boost agricultural productivity by an impressive 20 percent. These findings underline the urgent need for a shifttowards a sustainable management model combining circular economy principles with extensive social inclusion, essential for ecological resilience and rejuvenation of rural Ukrainian areas amidst conflict. CONCLUSION: Implementing circular economy and inclusivity in rural Ukraine reduces ecological threats by 45 percent, enhancing biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Circular economy and inclusion are key strategies for ensuring ecological resilience and restoration in rural areas of Ukraine during war time. The resilience and recovery of affected regions can be enhanced through the adoption of circular economy practices, waste reduction strategies, resource reuse initiatives, the advancement of low-carbon technologies, and active community participation in environmental endeavors.",Not About Sufficiency
Who’s fighting for justice?: advocacy in energy justice and just transition scholarship,"Recent political, economic and policy change in the US, Australia, and Europe, in particular, have put transitions towards low-carbon energy futures at the forefront of local and national policy agendas. How these transitions are managed is likely to affect the feasibility, timing and scope of transition policy. Recognizing the existing maldistribution of the benefits and burdens of fossil fuel-based extraction, energy generation, and distribution, advocates and scholars increasingly call for policies that not only support decarbonization goals, but also those of equity. Proposals that do not contain such goals may be met with resistance. This review examines the politics of achieving more just outcomes by asking, what is our current understanding of justice advocacy and the impacts of such advocacy on the energy transition? In this study, we systematically review articles that include the key concepts of ‘just transition’ or ‘energy justice’ and that examine advocacy in energy transition contexts. We find advocates from diverse communities and affiliated with varied organizational types are involved in advocacy. Diverse issues motivate advocates and the most common advocate type in the literature are residents that are affected by local impacts of energy transition decisions. Extra-institutional tactics are the most common means of advocate action. We also find that advocacy is often motivated by issues related to decision-making processes and environmental degradation. These findings illuminate that: (a) energy systems and transitions are governed by processes and institutions that are often inaccessible, (b) advocates often attempt to affect change using tactics external to such processes and institutions, and (c) issues of environmental degradation are often prominent in advocacy discourse concerning the energy transition. Future research should seek to more clearly determine advocates’ primary motivations and the tactics and actions that ultimately aid or hinder more equitable outcomes.",Not About Sufficiency
GIS-based measures of environmental equity: Exploring their sensitivity and significance,"In order to determine whether principles of environmental justice have been violated, a large number of empirical studies have been carded out to ascertain whether minority and low-income populations are disproportionately exposed to industrial pollution. This study provides a comparative evaluation of two commonly employed proximity measures in GIS-based environmental equity assessment, examining their influence on the results of the analysis, and proposes a methodology for evaluating the significance of these results. 1990 census data on population characteristics and data from the 1995 EPA's toxic release inventory (TRI) for the City of Minneapolis, MN are used. These results also allow a preliminary assessment of environmental equity/inequity in potential exposure to airborne toxic chemicals for racial minorities, poor people and children in Minneapolis. In the third part of the paper we develop and employ a geographic randomization methodology for assessing the significance of these results.",Not About Sufficiency
"Lymph, lymph glands, and homeostasis","Under aerobic conditions every respiring cell in the human body normally consumes oxygen to burn food and produce stoichiometric quantities of water which dissolves carbon dioxide and less soluble cell products. The effluent water and solutes appear in the form of lymph in the interstices between cells. The lymph effluent from all respiring cells flows to become the circulating lymph and blood plasma which coordinately sustain a steady state of homeostasis throughout the internal milieu. As a result, every living cell served by the vascular system has equal opportunity to partake of water and solutes emanating from or absorbed by remaining cells. Solute quantities available depend on cell location, regional plasma flow, local vascular permeability, molecular size, configuration, solubility and concentration, as well as avid cell receptors. Proportional to oxygen consumption, organized lymph glands develop in environments of relatively high oxygen tension around regional arteries to filter and process lymph coming from regional cells, and to produce effluent lymph rich in soluble globulins extruded by local mononuclear cells (especially macrophages, plasmacytes, lymphocytes), along with suspended small cytoplasm-poor lymphocytes. In turn, such dissolved globulins and remarkably motile small lymphocytes help feed, regulate growth and provide immunity to remaining cells. The lymph effluent from lymph glands and residua from capillary filtrates, along with newly absorbed solvent water, join the blood circulation during pulmonary inspiration in volumes proportional to the volume of air inspired with each breath.",Not About Sufficiency
Computed tomography of the brain in acute carbon monoxide poisoning,"Of 107 patients admitted to the South Western Hyperbaric Medical Centre with acute carbon monoxide poisoning for hyperbaric oxygen therapy 19 had cerebral imaging performed: 17 patients had CT, one patient had MRI and CT and one patient MRI alone. The role of brain CT is established in determining the prognosis from acute carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain imaging was indicated because of unconsciousness on admission and failure or delayed improvement in neurological status after initiation of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Of the 18 patients who underwent brain CT, seven were found to have the characteristic changes of bilateral low attenuation areas within the globus pallidus and six had low attenuation changes within cerebral white matter. In two patients there were both globus pallidus and cerebral white matter changes. Out of the total of the 19 patients who were studied, four patients died, 10 recovered fully and five had variable disabilities ranging from short term memory loss to more severe cognitive impairment and physical disability. The role of CT and the practicalities of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for acute carbon monoxide poisoning are discussed in the light of the experience from a regional dedicated medical diving centre. © 1996 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessing Sustainability Impacts and Paradoxes of Large-Scale Solar Farms in Energy Infrastructure Project,"This study aims to determine the sustainability impact of large-scale solar PV farms and to recommend strategies for their sustainable development. Using a comprehensive assessment framework, we analyzed environmental, economic, and social dimensions through a combination of life cycle assessment (LCA), cost-benefit analysis, and respondent interviews. Our findings reveal that while solar farms significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, they also pose challenges such as land use conflicts, ecological disruption, and social equity issues. Specifically, the displacement of agricultural land and impacts on local biodiversity emerged as critical concerns. Additionally, although solar farms create jobs and reduce energy costs, these benefits are sometimes offset by high initial investment costs and long-term maintenance. The study underscores the importance of integrated planning and policy-making to address these challenges and enhance the sustainability of solar energy projects. These insights contribute to the broader discourse on balancing renewable energy development with sustainable land and community management practices.",Not About Sufficiency

Social and institutional factors associated with land use and forest conservation along two urban gradients in Massachusetts,"With the rate of suburban development now surpassing the amount of land protected nationally for conservation, the act of preserving land from development becomes a crucial need to support critical ecosystem services and human quality of life. While previous studies have quantified the loss of forest lands and open spaces along urban gradients, rarely have they quantified the connections between land use policies, actions and land use change. We examined social and institutional factors positively influencing land conservation efforts across two urban gradients in Massachusetts, one surrounding the large, economically growing city of Boston and the other surrounding the smaller, economically depressed city of Springfield. Despite their differences, the metropolitan areas of these two cities are both growing rapidly. We measured forest and open space protection for a sample of 15 towns, comparing this with quantitative assessments of town-level open space policies, investment in conservation planning, wealth, and social capital, in the form of local land trusts. We found significant differences between the two urban gradients, with greater land protection occurring in the Boston area towns. The towns with the largest proportion of protected land were at the urban end of both gradients. We found that land trusts played a significant role in the conservation of open spaces, and wealthier towns were more likely to have long-standing, active land trusts. This result suggests that fostering land trusts in lower-income communities could have a lasting positive impact on land conservation in the face of rapid suburbanization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Social Aspects of Electric Vehicles Research-Trends and Relations to Sustainable Development Goals,"E-mobility sustainability assessment is becoming more comprehensive with research integrating social aspects without focusing only on technical, economic, and/or environmental perspectives. The transportation sector is indeed one of the leading and most challenging greenhouse gas polluters, and e-mobility is seen as one of the potential solutions; however, a social perspective must be further investigated to improve the perception of and acceptance of electric vehicles. This could consequently lead to the European Green Deal's holy grail: faster decarbonization of the transportation sector. Another way to achieve it is by promoting more comprehensive sustainable development goals. Therefore, this paper combines a systematic review of recent research with research emphasis focused on social aspects of electric vehicles and their interconnection with specific UN Sustainable Development Goals. By knowing the current research focus mainly related with ""perception"" of electric vehicles and assessing their social ""impact"" as well as an emerging area of ""user experience"" and their relations with UN Sustainable Development Goals enables better insight on the current and future directions of electric vehicle social sustainability research.

SOCIAL ECONOMY AND THE TRANSITION TOWARDS CIRCULAR ECONOMY: A SURVEY BASED APPROACH,"Introduction. . European social economy employment is 6.3% of the European Union's (EU) working population. In Romania and other recent EU member states, it is responsible for less than 2% of the total employment. The need for a precise legal and political concept of social economy and social enterprise confused the Romanian population and made their measurement easier. Both concepts have been increasingly employed in Romania since 2005, following the new EU policy approaches for social inclusion. Consequently, the social economy has grown significantly in recent years, with a diverse range of actors pursuing various social goals. Aim and tasks. . The paper aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the social economy in Romania by showing the activity types and their involvement in the circular economy transition and then by examining the social enterprises' social and economic performance. Results. . The creation of social value and social impact of social enterprises, the response of organisations to entrepreneurial change, and the level of risk-taking were substantiated. The way these aspects are correlated with performance was determined. A quantitative analysis of the social economy and transition towards a circular economy in Romania yielded the following main findings: i) more than half of the surveyed enterprises did not understand the concept of a circular economy, and ii) there was a strong statistically significant correlation (R=0.61) between social performance and environmental receptivity. The correlation between social and economic performance is statistically significant, with an average intensity (R=0.32). The correlation between economic performance and responsiveness to the environment was also statistically significant for medium-to-high intensity (R= 0.28). Conclusions. . The social economy puts social and democratic objectives into practice, whereas a circular economy is essential for a sustainable transition. Various actors operate in different industries and geographic areas in the Romanian social economy. Social economy actors aim to contribute to a more inclusive economy and equitable society, inspiring the government and private sector to demonstrate and implement more inclusive and sustainable practices. These practices cover decent labour, more education, and secure lives. Social innovation, defined as long-term solutions to social problems, is a critical way to build a circular society.",Not About Sufficiency
Social economy enterprises contributing to the circular economy and the green transition in Romania,"Recently, there is a new European Union commitment to the potential of the social economy which is a pioneer in job creation linked to the circular economy that will be further leveraged by the mutual benefits of supporting the green transition and strengthening social inclusion. Considering this general context, we propose in this paper an exploratory research aiming to investigate the potential of the Romanian social economy sector as part of a circular economy approach that could advance the green transition in the following years. Our paper is based on the findings of preliminary systematic content analysis for the identification of the social enterprises in Romania which include circular economy and/or green economy in their business model, and on qualitative research based on semi-structured in-depth interviews with the social economy organizations' managers. We have highlighted five good practice ex-amples (Recicleta, Atelierul de Panza, Educlick/Reconect, Remesh, and Bio&co Farm), which clearly show that combining the principles of social economy with the ones of circular/green economy is a strategy that might lead to overcoming the current challenges of the society. Our investigations represent the first approach to this topic, aiming to understand the specific challenges of the circular or green economy and social economy models when joining forces together for sustainable development in the context of an emerging social economy, as is the case of Romania.",Not About Sufficiency
Social inclusion and the circular economy: The case of a fashion textiles manufacturer in Vietnam,"There has been significant growth in interest in the circular economy (""CE"") concept as a transformative solution to the prevailing linear economy, helping to solve various economic, environmental and social challenges. Nevertheless, pertinent issues such as societal inclusion, well-being and equity remain peripheral in the contemporary CE debate. Fulfilling human needs has been recognised as a prerequisite for sustainable development and was implicitly and explicitly prevalent in parts of the seminal material on which the CE is based. However, the contemporary use of the concept by business has left it bereft of any convincing evidence that a CE will satisfy needs in a radically different way to the existing linear economy. As a result, there are few practical cases for business learning, and even fewer in a developing world context. This study explores a unique business venture implemented by a Vietnam-based denim manufacturer, which simultaneously tackles two key development challenges: The inclusion of vulnerable communities and sustainable resource use. The venture employs persons with disabilities and utilises textile by-products from the core production to produce a range of upcycled items (e.g., bags, cushion covers etc). This forms part of a broader company-wide social sustainability and CE strategy. We utilise Max-Neef's Human-Scale Development proposal as a lens explore how the venture can support need satisfaction of these employees while being environmentally sustainable. We seek to provide a compelling practical case to illustrate how social impact and circularity can be simultaneously enhanced at the micro-level.",Not About Sufficiency
Social indicators of ecosystem restoration for enhancing human wellbeing,"This study implements the ecosystem service framework to link the concepts of farming activity and ecosystem restoration within the circular economy. It proposes a method for identifying social indicators of ecosystem restoration that can be taken into account in the transition towards more circular and sustainable agricultural systems. Using a case study located in semi-arid Mediterranean landscapes, we conducted a social sampling with 350 respondents to explore how an almond tree restoration changes perceptions and preferences for ecosystem services, and how these socio-ecological changes translate into indicators of natural capital and human wellbeing. Results not only indicated that the almond tree restoration induced changes in people ' s preferences and perceptions for ecosystem services, such as an increase in ecosystem service diversity (i.e., local identity and erosion control), but they also demonstrated how the social and cultural benefits associated to ecosystem services can be used as indicators of human well-being (i.e., human health and access to goods). We suggest that the inclusion of social indicators of ecosystem restoration must be included in policies and initiatives for a transition to circular economy, and to achieve the challenges of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.",Not About Sufficiency

Social life cycle assessment of adaptive reuse,"Adaptive reuse of existing buildings and shared spaces has been highlighted as a key circular economy concept in the built environment, with the former also having been found to increase social sustainability through the preservation of cultural heritage. However, circular economy research has focused on the economic and environmental dimensions, with the social dimension receiving less attention. The aim of this study is, therefore, to establish the social impact of an adaptive reuse case with shared spaces. A supplementary aim is to test and adapt the general social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) framework to fit the built environment context. A qualitative single case study method is used. The study finds significant positive social impacts from the adaptive reuse case, mainly in the form of economic and cultural impact on the local community.

Social media and energy justice: A global evidence,"Over the past decades, several advances have been made in the climate field because of human activities, economic situation, and shift in the recognition that the people suffer most from the adverse effects of climate change. According to COP27, it is now commonly acknowledged that the poorest countries-those that pollute the least-are those that experience the worst effects of climate change. This recognition raises the issue of justice in environmental matters: today we speak of environmental justice, which would consist of applying justice principles to energy policy, energy production and systems, energy consumption, and climate change. The objective of this study is to examine the cross-sectional impact of social media penetration, particularly Facebook, on energy justice in a panel of 70 countries. We build three sub-indicators of energy justice: distributive justice, procedural justice, and restorative justice. We use OLS, Oster (2019), Lewbel 2SLS (2012) and Kiviet (2020) instrumental variable techniques and the results show that Facebook penetration improves energy justice across countries. Precisely, Facebook penetration boosts distributive, procedural and restorative justice. Therefore, social media should be included to enhance low-carbon transitions awareness among the masses. Further, social media should be promoted to emphasize on social services equitability, climate-vulnerable economies to help civil awareness and energy resilience.",Not About Sufficiency
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF FIRMS AND THE IMPACT OF BIO-ECONOMY IN INTELLIGENT USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES,"Through its whole set of activities related to the invention, development, production and use of biological products and processes, bio-economy contributes significantly to the economy and to the progress of society by improving the sustainability of health, nutrition, energy efficiency, industry, environmental protection and human well-being in general. In this study, by creating an overview of the efficiency of renewable energy sources, in the context of sustainable resource management for preserving a healthy, diverse and resilient ecosystem, the research aimed to show the unused renewable energy sources at maximum potential in Romania, what are the reasons for their non-use, what are the opportunities and what are the solutions that can be adopted for the exploitation of these types of renewable energy sources in Romania In the European Union, geothermal energy has already been well exploited and, in the future, will no longer make a significant contribution to increasing the productivity of renewable energies. Eurostat data was collected and processed using a linear regression model on the primary production of renewable energy in Romania and the rest of the European states for a period of 11 years (2005-2016); at the same time, statistical forecasts were made for the years 2017 and 2018 and was pursued to what extent social responsibility activities of companies is in line with the principles of bio-economy. In Romania, there is a very high potential for both geothermal energy that is insufficiently exploited to date and for the transformation of municipal waste into energy. It also explores the possibility of using intelligent information systems to optimize the exploitation of renewable energy sources. An important role in this effort is made by companies that, by adopting a Social Responsibility Code (CRS), can bring not only benefits, but also create a positive image with favorable consequences for all parties involved.",Not About Sufficiency

Socio-economic and environmental impacts of intended decarbonisation policies in the East Asia region,"Given the rising levels of carbon emissions, governments in the East Asia region are exploring effective decarbonization policies. This study examines the socio-economic and environmental implications of these policies using a computable general equilibrium model that captures the closed linkages between the economy and climate change. Our findings suggest that the intended decarbonization policy, aimed at accelerating technology transfer, may not always reduce carbon emissions. However, incorporating Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology into existing coal power plants and implementing a carbon tax could significantly reduce carbon emissions in all countries in the region. The paper suggests implementing carbon tax policy to reduce carbon emissions, retrofitting CCS technology in coal-based electricity powerplants, and developing renewable electricity at the same time as controlling emissions from non-renewable energy. These policies, however, need some supplement policy strategies to compensate for the potential output contraction due to the tax.",Not About Sufficiency
Socio-economic impact of natural resource management: How environmental degradation affects the quality of life,"Sustainable development is guided by three pillars: the economy, society and the environment.

This is the first research of its kind to examine the social and economic effects of environmental degradation changes while considering cross-sectional dependency. This article examines the effect of natural resource management policies and socioeconomic development on Asia's ecological footprint from 1995 to 2020, considering natural resources, population growth and industrial development. Our research shows that changes in the natural resources and ecological footprint have improved economic conditions and social outcomes, including human progress and income distribution. Two different outcomes of recent natural resource management are improved operational efficiency and decreased environmental degradation.

Socio-economic sustainability with circular economy - An alternative approach,"As the global population and living standards rise, it pushes the demand for basic amenities like food, health, and energy resources. Additionally, manufacturing automation has led to mass production and consumption, triggering waste production. The existing linear economy approach has led to increasing waste production and resource depletion, posing significant environmental and public health threats. To overcome these impediments, an alternative model called the circular economy concept has gained popularity in the global industry community. This closed-loop, restorative, waste-free concept has the potential to protect the environment and improve economics by reducing energy and resource consumption. Thus, major impetus should be given to strengthening the backbone of the economy where tools such as green technologies, decarbonization strategies, bio refinery processes, material flow analysis, life cycle assessment, ecological footprints (water, carbon, and material), substance flow analysis, circularity index, eco-designing, bioresource management, new business models, and policy play an essential role in the areas of socio-economic sustainability, ecological facts, and industrial aspects to enhance socio-economic growth in a sustainable manner.

"Socioeconomic influences on biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being: A quantitative application of the DPSIR model in Jiangsu, China","One focus of ecosystem service research is the connection between biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being as well as the socioeconomic influences on them. Despite existing investigations, exact impacts from the human system on the dynamics of biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being are still uncertain because of the insufficiency of the respective quantitative analyses. Our research aims are discerning the socioeconomic influences on biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being and demonstrating mutual impacts between these items. We propose a DPSIR framework coupling ecological integrity, ecosystem services as well as human well-being and suggest DPSIR indicators for the case study area Jiangsu, China. Based on available statistical and surveying data, we revealed the factors significantly impacting biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being in the research area through factor analysis and correlation analysis, using the 13 prefecture-level cities of Jiangsu as samples. The results show that urbanization and industrialization in the urban areas have predominant positive influences on regional biodiversity, agricultural productivity and tourism services as well as rural residents' living standards. Additionally, the knowledge, technology and finance inputs for agriculture also have generally positive impacts on these system components. Concerning regional carbon storage, non-cropland vegetation cover obviously plays a significant positive role. Contrarily, the expansion of farming land and the increase of total food production are two important negative influential factors of biodiversity, ecosystem's food provisioning service capacity, regional tourism income and the well-being of the rural population. Our study provides a promising approach based on the DPSIR model to quantitatively capture the socioeconomic influential factors of biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being for human-environmental systems at regional scales.

Multiple pathways towards sustainable development goals and climate targets,"The UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris climate target require a holistic transformation towards human well-being within planetary boundaries. However, there are growing debates on how to best pursue these targets. Proposed transformation strategies include market- and technology-driven green-growth, shifting towards a sufficiency-oriented post-growth economy, and a transformation driven primarily by strong government action. Here we quantify three alternative sustainable development pathways (SDPs), Economy-driven Innovation, Resilient Communities, and Managing the Global Commons, that reflect these different societal strategies. We compare the quantifications from two integrated assessment models and two sectoral models of the buildings and materials sectors across a broad set of indicators for sustainable development and climate action. Our global multi-scenario and multi-model analysis shows that all three SDPs enable substantial progress towards the human development goals of the SDGs. They simultaneously limit global warming and prevent further environmental degradation, with the sufficiency-oriented Resilient Communities scenario showing the lowest peak warming and lowest reliance on carbon dioxide removal as well as the largest improvements in biodiversity intactness. The SDPs also alleviate the concerns about the biogeophysical and technological feasibility of narrowly-focused climate change mitigation scenarios. However, the shifts in energy and food consumption patterns assumed in the SDPs, ranging from moderate in Economy-driven Innovation to very ambitious in Resilient Communities, also lead to increased challenges regarding socio-cultural feasibility.",Not About Sufficiency

La implementación de las metas específicas de la Agenda 2030 de la ONU, como ésta, supone un reto importante, ya que requieren acciones inmediatas, políticas públicas adecuadas y una colaboración sin precedentes entre entidades privadas, públicas y países. La meta 12.3 está intrínsecamente relacionada con muchas otras metas, por lo que su consecución tiene un impacto directo en varias de ellas. Por lo tanto, es vital alcanzarla con éxito, no sólo para reducir el hambre, sino también para lograr muchos otros objetivos de la Agenda y, en particular, para poder reducir nuestra huella medioambiental. La Prevención de Pérdidas y Desperdicios de Alimentos (FLW) es un objetivo dentro de la Economía Circular que puede considerarse central, ya que el objetivo 12.3 trata de prevenir la sobreproducción de alimentos con una mejor redistribución que no sólo reduzca los insumos, sino que también intente minimizar los desperdicios mediante la donación de productos alimentarios a entidades de la Economía Social (ES) que ayudan a los más necesitados. Dado que la Economía Circular contribuye a la resolución de los tres problemas ambientales más acuciantes la sobreexplotación de recursos, el calentamiento global y la pérdida de biodiversidad, además de todos los impactos negativos derivados de estos (ONU Medio Ambiente, 2019) prevenir las pérdidas y desperdicios de alimentos es también clave para asegurar la solución tanto de un profundo problema social, como de salud pública, además de los más importantes problemas medioambientales. A pesar de que resulta evidente la urgencia de una acción inmediata, diversos académicos, como Martín Río, Rogenhofer y Sandoval Alvarado (2022), destacan que la atención que este objetivo recibe por parte de la doctrina sigue siendo escasa. Por ello, el propósito de este trabajo es comparar estas políticas a ambos lados del Atlántico, proponer recomendaciones y ayudar a concienciar sobre el problema de las pérdidas y el desperdicio alimentario, siguiendo un enfoque holístico para todos los posibles actores implicados, ya que la comunicación es fundamental para alcanzar este objetivo. En este trabajo se presta especial atención a las políticas fiscales en los casos en los que se donan alimentos a Entidades de Economía Social como bancos de alimentos, fundaciones sin ánimo de lucro o comedores sociales, ya que los tributos pueden actuar como barreras o como facilitadores para alcanzar este objetivo; por lo tanto, es crucial aplicar las políticas tributarias correctamente para garantizar que actúan como verdaderos facilitadores.

Solar potential for social benefit: Maps to sustainably address energy poverty utilizing open spatial data in data poor settings,"Access to affordable sustainable energy is a significant challenge for many low-income countries experiencing energy poverty. The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 aims to ""ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all."" Simultaneously, the European Union (EU) seeks to reduce emissions by 55% by 2030. Decarbonization policies must be carefully considered to avoid adverse effects on vulnerable groups experiencing energy poverty. Solar technology offers a viable solution to decarbonize the building sector, reduce energy dependence on fossil fuels, and provide financial benefits to the public. Mapping solar potential is crucial to determine where investment in solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is most advantageous to the populations who stand to benefit the most. We combine a solar potential mapping approach incorporating socio-economic indicators indicative of energy poverty, using off-the-shelf Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools that are easily replicated across cities facing energy poverty. Utilizing lowest common denominator data and analysis approaches, we offer creative and innovative mapping solutions. The socioeconomic factors help to contextualise the benefits of distributed PV systems and highlight the need for mapping solar potential, in combination with energy poverty indicators for sustainable planning and policymaking. Our results for a case study in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria, demonstrate high solar energy potential that could meet 29% of the city's electricity needs, save citizens about M<euro>43.84 annually, and pinpoint where to invest first for the highest gains.

It makes use of an analytical approach that combines thematic analysis with a thorough, multidisciplinary, and organized assessment of the literature. The study looked at the political motivation and driving forces behind net-zero progress for each of these nations, as well as the benefits of decarbonization and its effects on equality and justice, as well as the historical background and obstacles that had to be overcome. This study's primary goals are to provide new empirical data on the strategy of energy policies in the real world by looking at the first eight countries to achieve net-zero success in the modern era. The study expanded the body of evidence on low-carbon transitions beyond the frequently and even over studied countries known as Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democracies or WEIRD countries. It is discovered that the nine policy interventions pertaining to waste management, renewable energy, and land use were employed in a comparable manner by all eight countries. Vulnerability to the impacts of catastrophic climate events, such as flooding and landslides, or the deterioration of ecosystems was a common barrier. Despite challenges, achieving netzero emissions positively impacts marginalized communities by distributing climate benefits more fairly, reducing health effects, and reducing social inequalities, especially in lowincome areas.",Not About Sufficiency

These countries are Bhutan, Suriname, Panama, Guyana, Comoros, Gabon, Madagascar, and Niue. It utilizes an analytical method of a rich, interdisciplinary and systematized literature review integrated with thematic analysis. For each of these countries, the study examines the drivers and political motivation behind net-zero progress, including the timeline of events; the barriers and challenges that had to be overcome; and the benefits of decarbonization and its impacts on equity and justice. The main objectives of the study are to broaden the evidence base on low-carbon transitions beyond often and even overstudied countries that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democracies, or WEIRD countries, and to offer new empirical data on the strategy of energy policies in the real world, examining the first eight countries to achieve net-zero success in the modern era. It finds that all eight countries used a similar mix of nine policy interventions involving land use, renewable energy, and waste management. Common barriers included vulnerability to the effects of extreme climate events either in the form of natural disasters (i.e. landslides and floodings) or ecosystems degradation (i.e. ocean acidification, coastal erosion and forests loss). Despite these barriers, achieving net-zero emissions positively impacted marginalized communities by providing a more equitable distribution of climate benefits, mitigating adverse health effects and reducing social inequalities, particularly in low-income areas.This study examines the political economy of decarbonization in eight countries over the period 2000 to 2021/2022 that have already achieved a national net-zero transition. These countries are Bhutan, Suriname, Panama, Guyana, Comoros, Gabon, Madagascar, and Niue. It utilizes an analytical method of a rich, interdisciplinary and systematized literature review integrated with thematic analysis. For each of these countries, the study examines the drivers and political motivation behind net-zero progress, including the timeline of events; the barriers and challenges that had to be overcome; and the benefits of decarbonization and its impacts on equity and justice. The main objectives of the study are to broaden the evidence base on low-carbon transitions beyond often and even overstudied countries that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democracies, or WEIRD countries, and to offer new empirical data on the strategy of energy policies in the real world, examining the first eight countries to achieve net-zero success in the modern era.

Spatializing Urban Forests as Nature-based Solutions: a methodological proposal,"The Fifth Session of the UNEA-5 defines Nature-based Solutions (NbS) as ""actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems, which address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem services and resilience and biodiversity benefits"". A large number of the EU HORIZON 2020 research program projects include the implementation of NbS in urban settings. The proGIreg project implemented several NbS for urban regeneration with and for citizens in its Living Lab in the city of Turin (Italy), among others. Focusing on the NbS of urban forestry, this paper addresses the following question: where can NbS be implemented within the city, in order to maximize their social impact? To achieve this goal, by identifying neighborhoods in need of NbS implementation, the 3-30-300 rule proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) was adopted and implemented, taking greater account of environmental and social characteristics. The paper also proposes an index to identify neighborhoods of the city that could have precedence in the implementation of NbS. The results highlight 10 neighborhoods where there is a high need of NbS implementation.",Not About Sufficiency

Coming to terms: toward a North-South bargain for the environment.,"To attack the major environmental problems, global warming, natural resource losses, and loss of biological diversity, an understanding between the industrialized and developing countries must occur. Weather patterns and sea levels are being affected by global warming which is caused by the use of fossil fuels and deforestation. The industrialized countries must cut back on the use of fossil fuels, and developing countries need to slow the process of deforestation. The loss of genetic resources and the extinction of species is happening rapidly, and most of it is in the tropical forests of developing countries. The developing countries are more dependent on their natural resources, forests, minerals, soils, and fisheries than industrialized countries. They are being depleted more rapidly with the population growth, social inequalities, and poor policies. Industrial countries are partly to blame also since they make investment and development decisions without concerns for the environment. The 4 major actions that can be initiated by industrialized countries are as follows. The initiation of national and international movements to reduce gas emissions that cause the greenhouse effect. The increased distribution of new technology and financing for population programs, sustainable development and environmental protection. The reduction of the external dept of developing countries, and the creation of programs to give technical assistance, scientific and other training for environmental problems of developing countries. Financial assistance can be linked to population programs and to environmental issues of the developing countries. Carbon dioxide taxes could be used to finance forest management and ecological zoning. The exchange of forest conservation for debt relief is a possible solution. Any dept restructuring plan should include strong environmental conservation provisions and policy reform requirements.",Not About Sufficiency

Stakeholder-driven evaluation of the impact of land reform programme on landscape changes using earth observation data,"South Africa’s land reform aimed to rectify historical land dispossession from colonial and apartheid policies, but the associated land use land cover (LULC) changes are under-researched. This study uses remote sensing and stakeholder perspectives to analyse the impact of the Salem Commonage land reform on LULC. Landsat images from 1986 to 2023 were analysed, supplemented by oral histories and perceptions of current trends. The LULC map accuracy ranged from 86–95%, validating the results. Findings showed built-up areas increased from 6.1–18.5%, while cultivated land decreased from 25–12.6%. The study observed deforestation and more bare land, indicating possible land degradation due to new ownership practices. Historical narratives and the results confirmed from Landsat image analysis were consistent with local land users’ views in this study, providing a socio-political context for these LULC changes. Stakeholders linked LULC changes to housing demands for marginalised communities, which prioritise housing over agriculture. Sub-division of large lands into smaller plots discourages farming, and new landowners’ limited capital hampers agricultural production. The study highlighted the importance of explaining LULC changes through stakeholder perceptions. The shift from farming to built-up areas reflects broader challenges in land reform, including poverty alleviation and limited agricultural support. Policies should integrate land-use planning, training, and financial aid to sustain rural livelihoods while addressing housing needs. This study provides valuable insights that can enhance sustainable land management strategies, particularly by addressing challenges arising from land reform outcomes. Furthermore, promoting equitable land use practices after reform will benefit the international scientific community, development practitioners, city planners, and other relevant stakeholders.",Not About Sufficiency

Stepping into the just transition journey: The energy transition in petrostates,"With the transition towards a low carbon economy underway, the notion of ensuring that it is a just transition - one that is fair and equitable - has captured significant attention in recent decades. Although petrostates are a central part of the fossil fuel-based global economy, they have been largely ignored in discussions of a just transition. This article explores what should characterize a just transition in petrostates, as they face challenges that are distinct from those faced by major producers of other fossil fuels such as coal. We argue that the just transition should be understood comprehensively to cover climate, energy, and environmental justice. Economic reforms, particularly investment diversification, institutional reforms, and the inclusion of women, youth populations and indigenous people are practical steps for achieving a just transition within petrostates. The importance of this research is to highlight that petrostates need to begin their just transition journey. There is limited time for this to happen, and taking steps into the just transition journey will have many benefits as identified in this research such as, socio-economic, impact on public health and an increase in inwardinvestments. The research involves utilizing the energy justice framework and assessing the five energy justice principles: procedural, distributive, restorative, recognition and cosmopolitan. In order to assess these we utilize data from the United Nations and World Bank to explore the key issues as asset diversification, employment and recognition issues. Finally, a just transition pathway is presented for petrostates to follow on the basis of the results.",Not About Sufficiency
Strategic approach towards sustainability by promoting circular economy-based municipal solid waste management system- A review,"The evolution of population and swift urbanization has augmented the quantum of municipal solid waste (MSW) across the globe. The MSW has numerous problems, such as health issues, climate change, societal imbalance, etc. Decision-makers continuously investigate a practical and viable solution for eradicating the solid waste management issue. The circular economy offers a critical solution for managing solid waste with a more organized and constructive approach. The study proposes the key facets to design a solid waste management system driven by the circular economy. The circular economy framework emphasizes the 4 R's-Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Recover. The review instils the importance of a waste collection and sorting station, waste treatment methods, and recovery of valuables from waste. The importance of policies and legislation in solid waste management systems with cases of developed countries are also discussed.

Study on energy-autonomous technology for energy consumption performance and climate adaptation in independent public toilets based on DesignBuilder simulation,"To enhance energy efficiency and climatic adaptation, this study explores the potential of energy-autonomous technology (EAT) in independent public toilets. Many public toilets today suffer from significant resource wastage due to reliance on external electricity, water, and sewage systems. EAT aims to address these issues by efficiently managing toilet energy requirements. Using DesignBuilder software, we simulated and analyzed energy consumption under various climatic conditions. The results highlight that Nanning, with its strong sun irradiation and mild temperatures, exhibits a daily peak energy use of around 3.25 kWh, making it ideal for implementing such technologies. In sunny but colder locations like Xining, there are also notable advantages. Tianjin, with an effective heat gain of approximately 3,090 MJ, demonstrates significant annual energy generation. Significant emission reductions were observed in Lhasa, emphasizing the environmental benefits of EAT. This research contributes academically by providing a comprehensive analysis of EAT performance in different climates, filling a gap in the existing literature regarding the application of EAT in public toilets. Practically, it offers a novel solution for promoting hygienic facilities in water-scarce or underdeveloped areas, where access to conventional sanitation is limited. From a policy perspective, our findings support the adoption of renewable energy strategies that align with broader environmental goals, such as reducing CO2 emissions. By demonstrating the effectiveness of EAT in diverse geographic settings, this study underscores its potential to contribute to sustainable development and improved public health infrastructure.",Not About Sufficiency

To explore the impacts of the responses of ecosystem health and human wellbeing and the combined effects under land use change, this paper, taking the Manas River Basin (MRB) as an example, evaluated the health status of the MRB by the model: Vitality (V), organization (O), resilience (R), and services (S). From a sustainability perspective, an index system of human wellbeing was constructed, which included society and the economy, health and safety, materials and resources, and ecology and the environment. On this basis, the coupling coordination relationship and sustainable development status of the basin was assessed. The results showed that as land use changed, the ecosystem health showed a downward trend, and human wellbeing grew exponentially. The sustainable development index and the coupling coordination degree of the MRB were similar, indicating that the level of balance between ecosystem health and human wellbeing was the key to the sustainable development of the basin, and the overall situation was in a state of moderate imbalance and moderate unsustainability.

Habitat Occupancy of the Critically Endangered Chinese Pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) Under Human Disturbance in an Urban Environment: Implications for Conservation,"ABSTRACTGlobally, urban expansion has led to habitat fragmentation and altered resource availability, thus posing significant challenges for wildlife. The Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) is a critically endangered species experiencing population decline due to illegal trade and habitat degradation. This study analyzed variables affecting habitat occupancy of Chinese pangolins using a single‐season occupancy model across 134 study grids (600 m × 600 m) in peri‐urban areas of Dharan Sub‐Metropolitan City, eastern Nepal. We identified termite mounds as a significant key factor (top model with AICwt = 1) in the detection probability of Chinese pangolin burrows (βTermite mounds = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.89). Additionally, the Human Disturbance Index (HDI) emerged as the key variable for habitat use occupancy (AIC = 231.96, AICwt = 0.309), indicating a significant negative impact (βHDI = −6.555, 95% CI = −11.324 to −1.7723). We observed a mean HDI of 0.475 ± 0.04 in the grids where Chinese pangolins were detected, with higher HDI values correlating with reduced Chinese pangolin occupancy. For the long‐term conservation of Chinese pangolins in urban landscapes, it is crucial to reduce anthropogenic activities and implement conservation measures to protect suitable habitats with abundant termite mounds.",Not About Sufficiency
"Enclave-Reinforced Inequality during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from University Campus Lockdowns in Wuhan, China","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted urban life and created spatial and social inequalities in cities. The impacts of lifting full lockdown restrictions once fast-spreading and community-acquired infection waves were under control are still not fully understood. This study aims to explore spatial inequality reinforced in the intervals between the waves of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Enclave-reinforced inequality resulting from enclave-based lockdown policies in Chinese cities was investigated through an analysis of the impacts of university campus enclave closures on the accessibility and crowdedness of urban green spaces. Using a modified two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and inversed 2SFCA (i2SFCA) method, accessibility and crowdedness were calculated and compared under two different scenarios. Additionally, the Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, and Theil index were used to measure and compare intra-city global and local inequalities under each scenario. The results indicate that the lockdown of university campus enclaves decreased the supply of urban green spaces. Campus closures not only exacerbated the unequal distribution of urban green space, but also reduced the inequality of crowdedness in urban parks due to increased crowdedness in parks near the closed enclaves. Moreover, both accessibility and crowdedness worsened when the calculations were weighted for population size and the total supply of green space. Enclave-based lockdown in cities reinforced spatial inequality, and it is highly complex and has multidimensional impacts on urban inequalities and environmental injustice which should be considered by urban planners and decision-makers hoping to create healthy, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable cities in the “new normal” of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainability evaluation based on the Three-dimensional Ecological Footprint and Human Development Index: A case study on the four island regions in China,"Sustainable development emphasizes the sustainability of natural resources and the environment as well as the development of social welfare. Under the background of resource scarcity and environmental constraints, maximizing social welfare is an inevitable choice to achieve sustainable development. Ecological Wellbeing Performance (EWP) can comprehensively reflect the efficiency of natural capital conversion into social welfare, and improving EWP is a feasible measure to achieve sustainable development. Moreover, island areas are the extremely complicated ecological-social-economic systems due to the traits that are geographical isolation, scarce resources, and frequent natural disasters, so that emphasizing the sustainability of island systems is a key step for achieving sustainable development goals. This study developed the EWP model based on the improved Three-dimensional Ecological Footprint (EF) and urban-scale Human Development Index (HDI), to synthetically evaluate and analyze the sustainable development of four major island regions in China with the data in 2017. Results found that: (1) The four regions are all in ecological deficits, being in exchange for overdraft natural capital for economic development. The EFdepth is greater than the original length 1 indicating the excessive consumption of the natural capital stock. The EFsize reflects the abundance and liquidity of regional natural capital, all the four regions are with the generally low level of flow capital utilization. Hainan with highest EFsize 0.428 is due to its comparatively sparse population density, abundant resources, and strong ecological capacity, while the relatively large population density and more restricted natural capital flows make Taiwan in the lowest value. (2) Judging from the evaluation results of the HDI, Chongming (0.796) and Hainan (0.773) high development level are relatively behind Taiwan (0.912) and Zhoushan (0.827) very high development level, for the impact of income is greater, that is, economic development in Hainan and Chongming is slightly weak. (3) Taiwan, with the highest EWP 3.646, shows the excellent natural resource utilization efficiency and sustainability, followed by Zhoushan, Chongming, and Hainan.

Sustainable agrobiorefinery system for advanced ethanol production from Opuntia prickly pear cactus nopales,"Cleaner industrial bioethanol production from sustainable biomass could support the circular economy to achieve Sustainable Development Goals while tackling climate change. Ethanol from the arid plants nopales (prickly pear, Opuntia ficus-indica) offers promising benefits for energy transition, water conservation and food security. However, the environmental impact and energy efficiency of nopal farming and ethanol production in plant-wide biorefineries are unknown. Inorganic production and the classic biorefinery cause undesirable environmental impacts that could be assessed to design better systems. Experiments and analyses of scenarios were performed to propose a cleaner and more energy-efficient farming and ethanol production in a plant-wide biorefinery. Four realistic scenarios considered two fertilisers, two pretreatments and two operational modes. Then, life cycle assessment, energy balances and energy efficiency principles were applied. Scenario 1 was environmentally harmful and energy inefficient (inorganic production and classic biorefinery). Scenario 4 is the cleanest and most energy-efficient (organic fertilisers and ionic liquids with acetone washing in a loop process). Scenario 4 showed the lowest impacts across all categories assessed, including global warming, acidification and eutrophication potentials (1.5 kg eq CO2, 0.004 kg eq SO2 and 0.0006 kg eq PO4, respectively). This enhanced system used the lowest amount of energy (0.33 MJMJethanolproduced-1) and showed the best energy efficiency when converting input energy into net energy as ethanol fuel (three-fold of that of scenario 1).

Sustainable Development and the Agenda of Global Social Justice,"This chapter explores the concept of ""just sustainability"". The notions of ""sustainability"" and ""social justice"" share the common agenda of conservation of nature. As per the Brundtland report, sustainability is conceived as a test of humanity's ability to meet ""the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"". However, there are different paradigms of sustainability in the literature, namely the ""green"" or environmental agenda and the ""social justice"" focused ""brown"" or poverty reduction agenda. While the more immediate focus of social justice and/or environmental justice (both social justice and environmental justice focus on distributive conceptions of justice: human security issues related to justice, equity, human rights, and poverty reduction, and so on) is intragenerational, the more pressing focus of sustainability is intergenerational. The agendas of ""social justice"" and ""sustainability"" thus seem to be conflicting. In this chapter, I focus on the interdependency of social justice/ environmental justice and ""sustainability"" even when sustainability is framed as green environment and social justice focuses on the brown social agenda of poverty reduction. The paper builds on the argument that unless global social justice (intragenerational access) is ensured under a fair social and institutional arrangement, the relationship of economic growth with sustainable development will always remain contentious and sustainable development will remain a mere ideal. I conclude that organisations and institutions must explore the common ground between justice and sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable Development as Freedom: Trends and Opportunities for the Circular Economy in the Human Development Literature,"This paper identifies, through a literature review, how 53 circular economy (CE) practices are related to the capability approach (CA) proposed by Sen. The main goal was to identify how a virtuous cycle between CE and CA can be developed. Five instrumental freedoms (IF) were analysed: economic facilities, social opportunities, protective security, political freedoms, and transparency guarantees. These relationships were analysed in three flows: CE practices positively impacting IF, CE practices negatively impacting IF, and the feedback influence of IF on CE practices. The results show that 32 of the 53 practices previously mentioned have not yet been studied from the CA context, which indicates that there are several research opportunities. From the practices considered, 72 articles were analysed in the final sample. The results suggest that several CE practices are aligned with the CA, considering that all five IF were identified as positive outcomes of CE practices. However, in some contexts, certain practices can have negative outcomes, which indicates that CE, at least in some cases, may not be considered as sustainable, as it decreases IF and, therefore, the social aspect of sustainability. The results also highlight that there is a feedback from IF to CE, in such a way that investing in the expansion of IF can facilitate the development of CE practices. Therefore, this study concludes that CE is indeed a way to fully operationalize sustainable development.",Not About Sufficiency
Sustainable energy planning for remote islands and the waste legacy from renewable energy infrastructure deployment,"The transition towards a sustainable energy mix is required to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7 for affordable and clean energy. Remote islands not connected to grid which depend on diesel generators may appear ideal because they can benefit from a variety of renewable energy sources. However, renewable energy deployment requires a lifetime perspective to not inherit waste and other problems to future generations. The aim of this paper is to present a life cycle sustainability framework developed and applied for the case of the island of Ushant off North West France. Seven renewable energy generation scenarios were examined and assessed using technoeconomic, social and environmental indicators utilising life cycle costing and life cycle assessment modelling. The results show that only three out of the seven examined renewable energy scenarios manage to cover the 6807 MWh per annum demand. These scenarios can improve all the indicators against the business-as-usual diesel generation scenario except the ones related to toxicity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 92%. The easy-to-use framework allows the users to adjust their scenarios and receive useful insight about the nature of the trade-offs between the various indicators. It can also be adapted and updated to include more technologies and support the investigation of more sustainable energy scenarios of other remote island cases in the future. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Sustainable intensification and carbon sequestration research in agricultural systems: A systematic review,"Mitigation pathways that stabilise global warming to 1.5 degrees C describe rapidly increasing deployment of landbased solutions, including increased carbon sequestration in soils and biomass. This places additional demands on land, which is also required to provide food security and other ecosystem services. Sustainable Intensification (SI) of agriculture has the potential to facilitate meeting demands for food and fibre, while simultaneously meeting environmental and ecological goals. The scientific literature has most often addressed the challenge of SI separately to climate change mitigation objectives in agricultural systems. Using a systematic review approach, we explored the compatibility of SI and carbon sequestration research through two contrasting case studies: Case Study I on Grassland Agriculture in Europe, and Case Study II on Smallholder Agriculture in Africa. We find contrasting levels of research theme similarity for SI and carbon sequestration, with European grassland agriculture research having lower similarity compared with African smallholder agriculture research. There was a focus on minimising biodiversity loss and environmental impacts in Europe, in contrast to a food security emphasis in Africa, reflecting regional and development differences. While there are clear context and agricultural-system specific differences between both case studies, both suggest that sustainable land use policies can be used to achieve SI integrated with climate mitigation in agriculture.",Not About Sufficiency

Systematic review of circular economy strategy outcomes in the automobile industry,"Circular economy (CE) activities are expected to deliver emission and resource benefits to the automobile industry while increasing economic competitiveness and social well-being. However, assessing the impact of these benefits has been challenging due to the variability in methodologies and assumptions used in previous studies. Considering this, we conducted a systematic review of 192 peer-reviewed studies to comprehensively synthesize the impact of five types of CE strategies on the automobile sector, focusing on five environmental and socio-economic outcomes. Our findings reveal that only a minority of studies investigated social outcomes (16%) and integrated dynamic aspects into the impact assessment (10%). While the impact direction analysis indicates that the five CE strategies generally have positive environmental impacts, we identified trade-offs in economic competitiveness associated with lightweighting through material substitution and human well-being issues related to lifetime extension. Furthermore, we identified factors such as transport, materials, and energy sources that contribute to backfire effects on global warming.

Implications / Recommendations: The aim of this paper is to investigate the chances of further development of biogas production in spite of current changes in Polish agendas. The topic is of great importance when analysing the strategy of Poland to develop a low-carbon economy. It is also a significant part of current discussions between the scientific community and business practitioners in terms of energy transition in Poland. What is worth noting is that Polish strategies concerning the development of renewable energy production should be aligned with the climate and energy targets of the European Union, which can prove problematic. Polish energy mix is still based on energy production from coal, while the EU is steadily increasing gross energy production from renewable energy sources. Contribution / Value Added: The analysis defines the role of biogas in circular economy as well as in modern economy with the consideration of environmental economics and sustainable development. It underlines the importance of biogas in energy transition in Poland, taking into consideration the Energy Policy of Poland until 2040 (Pol.

"Ageism, welfare, and the energy transition: a comparative analysis of the perceptions among the elderly in Poland and Norway","BackgroundOne of the potential dimensions on which exclusion and injustice may occur in energy transitions is age. Age-based patterns of exclusion—ageism—has recently been conceptualized in the context of decarbonization as energy ageism. This paper offers a comparative empirical analysis of the senior citizens’ outlook towards an imminent energy transition as well as the impact of energy poverty in two European countries: Norway and Poland.ResultsDrawing on interviews and focus groups with Polish and Norwegian seniors, we present the differences and similarities between the two countries, and the determinants of energy ageism, as well as the concept’s overall applicability and empirical usefulness. We find that socioeconomic conditions outweigh ageism, that is, the resilience of senior citizens in dealing with energy poverty during a transition is conditioned by their material standing and welfare state robustness rather than age based. An important factor is household heating technology, combined with economic vulnerability can push some individuals into energy poverty, while others using alternative sources of heat can navigate through energy crises unscathed.ConclusionsWe note the importance of mainstreaming social inclusion considerations in energy policy and of targeted digital competence building which can enhance senior citizen integration in the energy transition. Lower levels of digital competences among senior citizens certainly play a role and need to be addressed with education programs to increase participation. In both countries, household heating is a major issue and heating sources are strong predictors of energy poverty and regulatory measures and subsidies should be designed at national, regional, and municipal level to assist vulnerable groups in this area.",Not About Sufficiency
East Asian newly industrializing countries: Economic growth and quality of life,"The world is much impressed by the rapid economic development of four Asian Tigers - Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. However, it has often been taken for granted by many people that their social development is equally satisfactory. In order to investigate whether this belief is true or not, this paper looks at the levels of social development these countries have attained. Various measures of their quality of life will be assessed. Specifically, poverty, income distribution and environmental degradation are discussed. Despite their economic success, this study has found that most tigers are plagued by problems of poverty, increasing income disparities and environmental degradation. Further, social expenditures of these countries have been too limited to eliminate or impact on these problems.",Not About Sufficiency
China’s Sustainable Energy Transition Path to Low-Carbon Renewable Infrastructure Manufacturing under Green Trade Barriers,"Facing green trade barriers from developed nations, particularly the EU, based on product carbon footprints, China’s renewable energy industries confront significant challenges in transitioning towards sustainability and low carbon emissions. This study delves into the carbon footprint of China’s renewable infrastructure, evaluating wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) panels, and lithium batteries across varied decarbonization scenarios, emphasizing both production and international trade transportation. The initial findings for 2022 indicate baseline carbon footprints of 990,701 kg CO2-eq/MW for wind turbines, 2994.97 kg CO2-eq/kWp for PV panels, and 67.53 kg CO2-eq/kWh for batteries. Projections for 2050 suggest that decarbonization advancements could slash these footprints by up to 36.1% for wind turbines, 76.7% for PV panels, and 72.5% for batteries, closely mirroring the EU’s 2050 low-carbon benchmarks. Considerable carbon footprints from both domestic and international transportation have been quantified, underscoring the importance of logistic decarbonization. Based on these results, it is concluded that China’s steadfast commitment to a sustainable and climate-ambitious development path can provide globally competitive, low-carbon renewable infrastructure after 2030. The study advocates for a collaborative approach to product decarbonization across international trade, as opposed to erecting barriers, to effectively contribute to global climate objectives.",Not About Sufficiency

"Teachings of the People: Environmental Justice, Religion, and the Global South","The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Faith for Earth initiative calls for religiously inspired social action on local and global levels, focused on the seventeen interdependent sustainable development goals toward a just and peaceful world. Environmental justice must include an intersectional human rights approach to these issues by addressing the multiple and intersecting nature of lived experience, includ-ing gender, race, and socioeconomic status. My paper takes as its point of departure the UNEP Faith for Earth's recognition that environmental conditions have different impacts on the lives of men and women due to existing gender inequality. As both UN and UN Women have confirmed in their reports, women disproportionately suffer the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, especially in the global South. Environmental justice must address the critical link between envi-ronmental problems, and the rights of women and girls. Sustainable Development Goal five on gender equality includes addressing violence against women, sexual health and reproductive rights, and peace and security. I discuss how faith-based ini-tiatives, specifically Buddhist and African Indigenous Christian, have a positive role in grassroots environmental justice in the global South. My discussion includes the work of African Indigenous Christian, Nobel Laureate, and founder of the Greenbelt Movement, Dr. Wangari Muta Maathai, and the Theravada Thai lay Buddhist teacher and founder of the International Network of Engaged Buddhists, Sulak Sivaraksa. Their faith-based grassroots initiatives for environmental justice anticipate and are exemplary models for the UNEP Faith for Earth call to action. They emphasize a 'think global, act local' approach to environmental justice, by drawing on the wisdom and teachings of the people.

Hydropower’s Role in Enhancing Energy Justice: Preliminary Insights from the EU and Turkey,"This study examines recent energy transition policies and the conceptual framework of energy justice, emphasizing the role of hydropower, in ensuring the equitable distribution of energy services and burdens. The analysis focuses on the EU’s energy mix, highlighting the capacity of hydropower and its impact on energy justice, and examines the relationship between migration and energy poverty in countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey. In addition to their role as a source of renewable energy, hydropower offer a range of other benefits, including irrigation, flood control, water supply and fisheries. Despite these benefits, the construction of dams can also give rise to several social impacts, including environmental degradation, displacement of local communities and disruption to traditional livelihoods. The study concludes that hydropower remains critical to the EU’s transition to a sustainable and equitable energy system and supports social justice through improved energy access and security.",Not About Sufficiency
Tempering growth: planning for the challenges of climate change and growth management in SEQ,"South East Queensland (SEQ) has experienced voracious growth over the past five decades. Spanning some 200 km, this sprawling subtropical coastal conurbation is beginning to reach its ecological and socio-political limits. Over the last decade there have been concerted efforts to manage this growth with a new regime of plans and policies, but climate change has significantly complicated the challenge. This paper offers a preliminary analysis of the situation. The major climate adaptation challenges for the region are identified, including: rising sea levels, storm surges, higher temperatures, and increased freshwater scarcity. These will impact most on the elderly, sick and disadvantaged who have lower levels of resilience. The key plans and policies that address these issues are then reviewed, including: ClimateQ; the SEQ Regional Plan; and, the Draft SEQ Climate Change Management Plan. The overall planning regime is appraised in light of five core themes of strong ecological modernisation (technological innovation; engaging with economic imperatives; political and institutional change; transforming the role of social movements and discursive change) and the principles of environmental justice. It is argued that together these schools of thought could provide criteria for a more effective and equitable climate adaptation response for the region.",Not About Sufficiency
Ten facts about land systems for sustainability,"Land use is central to addressing sustainability issues, including biodiversity conservation, climate change, food security, poverty alleviation, and sustainable energy. In this paper, we synthesize knowledge accumulated in land system science, the integrated study of terrestrial social-ecological systems, into 10 hard truths that have strong, general, empirical support. These facts help to explain the challenges of achieving sustainability in land use and thus also point toward solutions. The 10 facts are as follows: 1) Meanings and values of land are socially constructed and contested; 2) land systems exhibit complex behaviors with abrupt, hard-to-predict changes; 3) irreversible changes and path dependence are common features of land systems; 4) some land uses have a small footprint but very large impacts; 5) drivers and impacts of land-use change are globally interconnected and spill over to distant locations; 6) humanity lives on a used planet where all land provides benefits to societies; 7) land-use change usually entails trade-offs between different benefits-""win-wins"" are thus rare; 8) land tenure and land-use claims are often unclear, overlapping, and contested; 9) the benefits and burdens from land are unequally distributed; and 10) land users have multiple, sometimes conflicting, ideas of what social and environmental justice entails. The facts have implications for governance, but do not provide fixed answers. Instead they constitute a set of core principles which can guide scientists, policy makers, and practitioners toward meeting sustainability challenges in land use.",Not About Sufficiency
The 'Environmentalism of the Poor' revisited: Territory and place in disconnected glocal struggles,"In 2002, the year it was published, The Environmentalism of the Poor was one of the first books examining in a multidisciplinary perspective three parallel environmental movements around the world. Eleven years later, we re-examine these movements - the Cult of Wilderness, the Gospel of Eco-Efficiency and the Mantra of Environmental Justice, - focusing on the increased visibility of struggles representing Environmental justice and The Environmentalism of the Poor. Even if they are often disconnected from an organizational standpoint, glocal manifestations of resistance have emerged since the 1990s. Today, environmental movements assert common values related to place, identity, and culture. Activists' concepts such as ecological debt, environmental justice, environmental liabilities, land grabbing, environmental gentrification, corporate accountability, climate justice, food sovereignty, or economic degrowth are the keywords of the networks of the global Environmental justice movement. At the same time, such concepts support the rural and urban movements that remake place for marginalized groups, re-assert traditional practices, and protect territory from contamination, land appropriation, and real estate speculation. Some possibilities exist for cooperation between Environmental justice and the other varieties of environmentalism. Here, comparative research can help unravel the use of valuation languages different from ""green"" economic growth or sustainable development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"The (FWE)<SUP>2</SUP> nexus: Bridging food, food waste, water, energy, and ecosystems for circular systems and sustainable development","Background: The imperative for sustainable resource management has become increasingly critical in the context of a rapidly expanding global population and heightened resource demands, compounded by the pressing challenges of climate change and environmental degradation. Traditional sector-specific approaches, which frequently isolate agriculture, energy, and water management, have proven inadequate in addressing the complex interdependencies inherent in resource ecosystems. In this regard, the Food, Food Waste, Water, Energy, and Ecosystems ((FWE)2) nexus framework emerges as a transformative paradigm that advocates for an integrated understanding of these interconnected components. This framework is essential for the implementation of comprehensive strategies designed to address the multifaceted sustainability challenges confronting contemporary society. Scope and Approach: The current research undertakes a comprehensive investigation of the (FWE)2 nexus framework, elucidating the dynamic interactions among food systems, waste management, water utilization, energy production, and ecosystem integrity. Through an extensive synthesis of the current literature, illustrative case studies, and empirical analyses, multifaceted dynamics inherent to the nexus were outlined. Key themes prominently featured include the necessity of conceptualizing food waste (FW) as a critical resource, the strategic deployment of technology to enhance operational efficiency, and the integration of circular economy principles to optimize resource utilization. Collectively, these elements advocate for sustainable practices that can yield substantive benefits for society and the environment. Policy implications and key findings: The (FWE)2 nexus framework is essential for tackling the intertwined challenges of food production, FW management, water resources, energy consumption, and ecosystem health. Policymakers should prioritize collaborative efforts that unite government agencies, businesses, and communities. This synergy can create comprehensive strategies that enhance resource governance and improve global food security. Additionally, initiatives focused on public education and community engagement are vital, empowering individuals to actively participate in sustainable resource management and fostering significant societal and environmental benefits. This research demonstrates the considerable potential of the (FWE)2 nexus framework in advancing several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Optimizing agricultural practices and reducing FW directly support SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) by enhancing food security and nutrition. Furthermore, Considering FW as a valuable resource aligns with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), promoting sustainable consumption and waste reduction through circular economy principles that facilitate nutrient recovery and renewable energy generation. Moreover, effective FW management significantly contributes to SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) by promoting water conservation and improving water quality. The framework also underscores energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources in food production and waste management, thereby supporting SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). In addition, it plays a crucial role in SDG 13 (Climate Action) by reducing greenhouse gas emissions linked to food waste and resource overconsumption. By aligning these strategic efforts with the broader SDG framework, the (FWE)2 nexus framework actively contributes to the global sustainability agenda, offering actionable pathways toward sustainable development that benefit current and future generations.",Not About Sufficiency
"The AFOLU sector's role in national decarbonization: a comparative analysis of low-GHG development pathways in Brazil, India and Indonesia","This paper analyses the role that AFOLU (agriculture, forest and other land use) plays in national deep decarbonization scenarios in Brazil, India and Indonesia between 2020 and 2050. It finds that the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) subsector is important for medium-term mitigation (2020-2030) while continuing to contribute to mitigation over the long-term (2030-2050) in the three countries. Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15). Common policy areas were identified, including incentives to land managers for conservation or more environmental agricultural practices; changing regulations of land use to protect ecosystems and/or encourage shifts in agricultural practices; and strengthening enforcement capacity of land protection.",Not About Sufficiency
The appeal of the circular economy revisited: on track for transformative change or enabler of moral licensing?,"The proposal of an economy that is circular and without the need for material or energy input has an irresistible appeal to those who recognize the precautionary concept of planetary boundaries and acknowledge that resources are limited. Thus, in the public discourse, its narrative outperforms other lines of arguments when it comes to keeping radical critics of destructive extractivism and the growth imperative in check and averting discussion of degrowth, post-growth, or other systemic alternatives by larger segments of the population and government bodies. Moreover, the myth of a circular economy has the additional benefit that it can win over parts of the environmental movement that is apprehensive of radical and transformative change, particularly in the urban milieus of a middle class that enjoys the privileges of the current social order. In this paper, I argue that the circular economy narrative tends to hinder the necessary systemic transformation while entailing a wide range of specific measures that deserve to be recognized for their merit.",Not About Sufficiency
The Circular Economy: An Interdisciplinary Exploration of the Concept and Application in a Global Context,"There have long been calls from industry for guidance in implementing strategies for sustainable development. The Circular Economy represents the most recent attempt to conceptualize the integration of economic activity and environmental wellbeing in a sustainable way. This set of ideas has been adopted by China as the basis of their economic development (included in both the 11th and the 12th 'Five Year Plan'), escalating the concept in minds of western policymakers and NGOs. This paper traces the conceptualisations and origins of the Circular Economy, tracing its meanings, and exploring its antecedents in economics and ecology, and discusses how the Circular Economy has been operationalized in business and policy. The paper finds that while the Circular Economy places emphasis on the redesign of processes and cycling of materials, which may contribute to more sustainable business models, it also encapsulates tensions and limitations. These include an absence of the social dimension inherent in sustainable development that limits its ethical dimensions, and some unintended consequences. This leads us to propose a revised definition of the Circular Economy as ""an economic model wherein planning, resourcing, procurement, production and reprocessing are designed and managed, as both process and output, to maximize ecosystem functioning and human well-being"".",Not About Sufficiency
The Circular Economy: Swings and Roundabouts?,"In the last few decades the Circular Economy has increasingly been advertised as an economic model that can replace the current ""linear"" economy whilst addressing the issues of environmental deterioration, social equity and long-term economic growth with the explicit suggestion that it can serve as a tool for Sustainable Development. However, despite the individual prominence of the Circular Economy and Sustainable Development in the academic and wider literature, the exact relationship between the two concepts has neither been thoroughly defined nor explored. The consequent result is various inconsistencies occurring across the literature regarding how the Circular Economy can serve as a tool for Sustainable Development and an incomplete understanding of how its long-term effects differ from those of the ""linear"" economy. A literature review was conducted to interpret the current conceptual relationship between the Circular Economy and Sustainable Development. The review highlights numerous challenges concerning conceptual definition, economic growth and implementation that inhibit the use of the Circular Economy as a tool for Sustainable Development in its current form. The review concludes by providing suggestions for how research concerning the Circular Economy should proceed if it is to provide a potential approach for achieving Sustainable Development.",Not About Sufficiency
The Distributional Effect of A Carbon Tax on Income in Taiwan,"Environmental issues have become more important worldwide. A carbon tax is a strong tool for cutting carbon emissions directly through the internalization of the external costs of pollution. To mitigate the impact of carbon taxation, it is necessary to recycle the tax revenue into other taxes, subsidies, and transfers. In Taiwan, carbon tax policy has been under consideration. To analyze the effect of carbon tax and tax revenue recycling, this paper adopts a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model-General Equilibrium Model for Energy, Environment, and Technology (GEMEET)-under a comprehensive economic systems framework. The results show that a suitable recycling mechanism is a key factor for the success of green tax reform for a significant improvement in the economy, environment, and in income distribution, simultaneously.",Not About Sufficiency

"The Effect of Environmental Degradation, Climate Change, and the European Green Deal Tools on Life Satisfaction","Environmental issues, sustainability, and climate change have become the targets of many policies from international and governmental organizations including the EU's European Green Deal action plan. This plan provides tools to address them-which include support for the circular economy, implementation of energy and environmental taxes, and investment in environmental protection-with the aim of favoring the well-being of EU citizens. In this context, this study analyses the impact of several parameters (environmental matters, global warming, circular economy, energy and environmental taxes, and expenditure and investment on the environment) on life satisfaction, or subjective well-being, and their effects on 33 European countries. For this purpose, four econometric models were carried out using data collected from the World Values Survey (WVS), the European Values Study (EVS), and the World Bank and Eurostat, reflecting subjective citizen satisfaction data. The findings present a highly significant inverse relationship between life satisfaction variables and both environmental problems and energy taxes.

The energy-climate-health nexus in energy planning: A case study in Brazil,"Global greenhouse gas emissions from energy production were approximately 40% higher in 2017 than in 2000 (International Energy Agency, 2018), and ambient particulate matter - one of the byproducts from fossil fuel combustion of most concern for public health - is now the fifth largest contributor to global disease (Cohen et al., 2017). Achieving the climate targets of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals requires better accounting for climate and health costs in energy planning. This paper quantifies trade-offs between selected energy infrastructure, climate, and health costs when meeting future electricity demand by increasing the share of renewable energy, with a focus on variable renewable energy (VRE; here: wind and solar photovoltaic power). Using a spatially and temporally resolved approach, we analyzed three scenarios for year 2030 for Northeast Brazil, characterized by 30%, 45%, and 70% of VRE (the latter corresponds to 100% renewable energy). We find that accounting for the health impacts from electricity generation is sufficient to economically justify deep decarbonization of Northeast Brazil's power sector. Full decarbonization is economically justified when the carbon price exceeds $20/tonne CO2, which is less than Brazil's country-level social cost of carbon and only 4.8% of the global social cost of carbon. Our study shows that regional climate and health costs from electricity generation alone can be greater than the additional infrastructure costs of decarbonization. Our results highlight how systematically accounting for health and climate costs in energy planning would economically justify the decarbonization of energy systems.",Not About Sufficiency

"The Environmental Injustice of ""Clean Coal'': Expanding the National Conversation on Carbon Capture and Storage Technology to Include an Analysis of Potential Environmental Justice Impacts","Over the past decade, the coal industry has created a multi-million dollar public relations campaign to insulate coal from the green energy revolution and the anticipated public backlash against dirty and unsustainable fuels. This campaign, promoting ""clean coal,'' has effectively shifted the national conversation on energy and climate change to situate coal as a viable clean energy source and the best option available to mitigate climate change. As the U.S. gets closer to passing national climate legislation and the deadline for achieving significant global reductions in carbon emissions draws near, opposition to the coal industry and its Clean Coal Campaign is organizing on a number of fronts. The environmental justice movement, through its leadership on climate justice, can serve as a centralizing force for these disparate advocacy efforts, bringing together students, scientists, policy advocates, community residents, and others engaged to fight clean coal and advance real green energy solutions.

The hierarchy of resource use for a sustainable circular economy,"Purpose The original principles of the hierarchy of resource use seem to have been forgotten. The purpose of this paper is to address the necessity of these principles in order for a circular economy (CE) to be sustainable. Design/methodology/approach This is a general review paper explaining today's shortcomings in a CE and in the waste hierarchy. Its theoretical contribution is illustrated using the example of marine plastic waste in the Arctic, as well as the EU's action plan for a CE: ""Closing the loop"". Findings There is a need to reduce raw materials into the economy directly and not only as a potential result of recycling. This is supported theoretically and by illustrating that the EU's action plan is closing the loop primarily from the output side. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical possibility of complete recycling rests on a premise that is now at odds with a sustainable development. Social implications - The power of existing raw material production cycles must be challenged to allow reduction to be a real option. If not, a CE may exacerbate a moral trade-off by the current generation reducing the safe operating space of future living beings. Originality/value The theoretical possibility of recycling everything, also known as the technology-optimist view, has played the role of a safety net for humanity. As we are now exceeding planetary boundaries for a safe and just space for humanity, this theoretical safety net is no longer valid.

The Impact of Circular Economy on Economic Development A Review of EU's Countries,"Over time, the concept of economic development has been the cause of debates in the research environment. Some of the researchers consider the level of economic development of a country to be characterized by high levels of the main macroeconomic aggregates, while another part supports the idea of uniform economic development with a high level of social inclusion. Regardless of the definition of the concept of economic development, it has been proven that a major positive impact is generated by the sustainable development strategy, especially in the light of the concept of circular economy. Therefore, the study addresses the level of economic development of the member states of the European Union based on the impact generated by the circular economy. In addition, based on the analysis carried out, the paper aims to identify the dependency ratio between the variables associated with the circular economy concept and the level of economic development. In order to achieve these goals, a panel regression model was estimated, for all member states of the European Union, on the time horizon 2011-2020. The model used as dependent variable ""the level of economic development"", and the independent variables were made up of variables associated with the circular economy. The results of this analysis reveal that there are individual effects on both dimensions associated with the analysis (cross-sectional, time series), which leads to the idea that each country is influenced in the process of economic development through the circular economy by its own specificities.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Energy Poverty Alleviation on Carbon Emissions in Countries along the Belt and Road Initiative,"Energy poverty and climate change are global challenges. While the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has fostered energy cooperation and alleviated energy poverty in BRI countries, its impact on climate change requires careful examination. This study investigates the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions in BRI countries and analyzes the underlying mechanisms. In particular, this study constructs an integrated energy poverty assessment framework that includes three dimensions of energy accessibility, cleanliness, and affordability and utilizes the entropy-TOPSIS method to assess the status of energy poverty in 70 BRI countries. Subsequently, an empirical analysis using the Gini index as an instrumental variable was conducted to explore the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions and the specific mechanisms. It is found that alleviating energy poverty in BRI countries will lead to an increase in per capita carbon emissions. However, improving energy cleanliness is effective in reducing per capita carbon emissions, while improving energy affordability has no significant impact on carbon emissions. This study shows that energy poverty alleviation and carbon emission reduction are two non-conflicting sustainable development goals.

The justice and policy implications of clean energy transition in Africa,"Despite the low local energy access rates, Africa is considered a key player in the global energy transition due to its large supply of fossil fuels and a large reserve of critical minerals essential for manufacturing renewable energy components in the energy sector and storage devices in the transportation and electronics sectors. But building a sustainable society at all levels across nations would only come when there exists a just and inclusive energy transition based on the idea of ""leave no one behind"". While many African countries have embarked on ambitious and transformative transition strategies, and many energy projects classified as ""clean"" have economic, environmental, and social implications that jeopardize the wellbeing of those already vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This paper explores the policy implications of the just transition to ensure that efforts to steer Africa towards a lower carbon future are supported by fair, equity, and justice considerations. Our analyses provide valuable evidence for considering a just transition in Africa that will not exacerbate the current socio-economic challenges the region is facing but will support sustained poverty reduction and the achievement of faster economic growth. Our findings show that the African continent's multiple challenges of energy security, economic growth, and affordable access must feature in its clean energy transition. We draw conclusions that an incremental transition emphasizing low-carbon development is the most feasible and pragmatic approach to transform the region's economy and address climate change challenges.",Not About Sufficiency
The long-term impacts of carbon and variable renewable energy policies on electricity markets,"We present a computationally-efficient optimization model that finds the least-cost generation unit expansion, commitment, and dispatch plan to serve hourly electricity demand and ancillary service requirements. We apply the model to a case study based on data from the electricity market in Texas (ERCOT) to analyze the market and investment impacts of several incentive mechanisms that support variable renewable energy (VRE) investments and carbon emission reductions. In contrast to many previous studies, the model determines least-cost VRE investments under different cost and incentive assumptions rather than analyzing scenarios where VRE expansion is pre-determined. We find that electricity prices can vary significantly under different incentive mechanisms, even when comparable generation portfolios result. Therefore, the preferred incentive mechanism depends on stakeholder objectives as well as the prevailing electricity market framework. Our results indicate that a carbon tax is more system cost-efficient for reducing emissions, while production and investment tax credits are more system cost-efficient for increasing VRE investments. Similarly, incentive mechanisms that reduce electricity prices may increase the need for separate revenue sufficiency mechanisms (e.g. a capacity market) more than a policy that increases electricity prices. Moreover, the impacts on consumer payments are not always aligned with changes in system costs.

For constructing the evaluation model of human development considering the earth pressure from the sub-national level, and observing the changes of human development level under the earth pressure in China in recent years, this paper constructs the PB-HDI (Planetary Boundaries-Human Development Index) index to measure the human development level under planetary boundaries in 30 Chinese provinces of 2010, 2014, 2017, and 2020; and carries out the analysis of evolutionary characteristics and spatial heterogeneity inspired by the path of balancing the relationship between environmental protection and economic development in China. We found: (1) the regional PB-HDI differences show a convergence trend, with a gradual decrease in low-level provinces; (2) the regional heterogeneity of PB-HDI is obvious. The differences between eastern provinces are the largest; (3) resources and environment constitute the outer circle of economic and social development, forming a ""doughnut"" inclusion pattern that discourages high-level development beyond the boundary and low-level development within the boundary. In general, there are significant differences in economic development, environmental protection level, social security capacity, industrial structure, innovation level, policy environment, and other basic conditions among different regions of China, and sustainable development paths need to be determined according to local conditions. This study is critical for expanding the application of the sub-national human development assessment for global stress and optimizing China's sustainable development path.",Not About Sufficiency
The Myanmar borderlands as a green energy transition 'sacrifice zone': A case study of rare earth mining in Kachin state,"This article examines the challenges of achieving a 'just transition' to a sustainable and low-carbon economy and the spatially uneven distribution of costs that such a transition entails. It does so from the vantage point of Myanmar's war-torn borderlands with China, which have emerged as a major source of heavy rare earth elements, crucial to technologies including electric vehicles and wind turbines. Through a fine-grained analysis of rare earth mining in northern Myanmar, this paper explores how critical mineral frontiers drive new forms of geographically uneven development and reveal the spatial effects of the green energy transition. Our research reveals how marginalised communities currently bear disproportionate social and environmental burdens for the green energy transition and emphasises that greater focus must be placed on who and where bears the costs of this transition by centring the needs and experiences of those living in green energy 'sacrifice zones'. We argue that if the notion of a just transition is to be meaningful in any serious and pro-poor way, it must confront how such sacrifice zones are produced and what can be done to promote social and environmental justice in these places.",Not About Sufficiency
"The political economy of net-zero transitions: Policy drivers, barriers, and justice benefits to decarbonization in eight carbon-neutral countries","This study examines the political economy of decarbonization in eight countries over the period 2000 to 2021/ 2022 that have already achieved a national net-zero transition. These countries are Bhutan, Suriname, Panama, Guyana, Comoros, Gabon, Madagascar, and Niue. It utilizes an analytical method of a rich, interdisciplinary and systematized literature review integrated with thematic analysis. For each of these countries, the study examines the drivers and political motivation behind net-zero progress, including the timeline of events; the barriers and challenges that had to be overcome; and the benefits of decarbonization and its impacts on equity and justice. The main objectives of the study are to broaden the evidence base on low-carbon transitions beyond often and even overstudied countries that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democracies, or WEIRD countries, and to offer new empirical data on the strategy of energy policies in the real world, examining the first eight countries to achieve net-zero success in the modern era. It finds that all eight countries used a similar mix of nine policy interventions involving land use, renewable energy, and waste management. Common barriers included vulnerability to the effects of extreme climate events either in the form of natural disasters (i.e. landslides and floodings) or ecosystems degradation (i.e. ocean acidification, coastal erosion and forests loss). Despite these barriers, achieving net-zero emissions positively impacted marginalized communities by providing a more equitable distribution of climate benefits, mitigating adverse health effects and reducing social inequalities, particularly in low-income areas.",Not About Sufficiency
The politics of negative emissions technologies and decarbonization in rural communities,"Non-technical summary Technologies and practices to remove carbon from the atmosphere ('negative emissions technologies') will be challenging to scale-up. Efforts to incentivize or govern their scale-up globally risk failing if they miss the social challenges. This paper analyzes prospective challenges for negative emissions through examining how decarbonization practices are evolving in one particular landscape: the Imperial Valley in southeast California, a desert landscape engineered for industrial agriculture. Based on semi-structured interviews and site visits, this paper examines how community actors have received, participated in, imagined or contested new energy technologies and climate practices, and draws out takeaways for negative emissions policy. Technical summary This article examines prospective challenges and opportunities for scaling up negative emissions technologies (NETs) through examining how decarbonization practices are evolving in one particular landscape: the Imperial Valley in southeast California, a desert landscape engineered for industrial agriculture. Local officials, community activists and business ventures are re-imagining the valley as a renewable energy landscape, some with interest in carbon-negative technologies. At the same time, aspects of this strategy for economic development via green energy are often contested. Based on semi-structured interviews and site visits, this paper examines how landscape-level actors have received, participated in, imagined or contested new energy technologies and climate practices. Through analyzing local perspectives on climate change and emerging energy technologies, the paper draws out three takeaways for the governance of NETs: (1) entrenched interests can play a role in shaping how particular NETs compete; (2) environmental justice concerns around NETs should be viewed as more than not-in-my-backyard-ism; and (3) incentives for NETs must be tailored to local contexts. The conclusion discusses two crosscutting challenges: the lack of institutions to build out new infrastructure and the challenge of generating narratives around invisible 'negative' emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
The risk-based environmental footprints and sustainability deficits of nations,"The implementation of environmental sustainability accounting has attracted academic attention; however, methods to accommodate local biophysical limitations remain underexplored. We developed a novel risk-footprint environmental sustainability assessment (Risk-Footprint ESA) framework to measure a country's environmental sustainability with respect to local biophysical capacity to help nations take collective action to stay within a safe operating space. Our findings indicated that the global environmental footprints of water, land, energy, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus witnessed variable increases of 325 %, 39 %, 36 %, 95 %, 6 %, and 3 % respectively, between 1990 and 2015. China, India, and the United States exhibited the largest footprints across these categories. Excluding water and land use, it appears that the global population is not maintaining lifestyles within the limits of the planet. Furthermore, the most effectively managed resource was land, with nearly 95 % of the countries maintaining sustainable reserves from 1990 to 2015. Conversely, nitrogen presents the greatest challenge in achieving sustainability, with only 25 % of the countries managing a reserve for this indicator. Additionally, there was a correlation between rising affluence and exceeding sustainability limits, suggesting that low income reduces the chances of eradicating poverty and diminishes the ability to maintain environmental sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of economic policy uncertainty and social welfare in the view of ecological footprint: evidence from the traditional and novel platform in panel ARDL approaches,"In the contemporary world, environmental degradation has become a concern for human beings. Accordingly, the impact of social welfare, economic policy uncertainty, natural resource rents, life expectancy, and trade openness are examined on ecological footprint (the most comprehensive proxy of environmental degradation) in 19 energy- intensive countries from 1997 to 2018. With this in mind, this study used the traditional panel ARDL and CS-ARDL approaches to evaluate how the study's variables influence ecological footprint. Notably, the results of the CS-ARDL approach are more robust due to cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity problems. The outcomes revealed that economic policy uncertainty and trade openness affect the ecological footprint negatively in the short run and positively in the long run. Moreover, social welfare degrades the environment in the long run, and natural resource rents improve environmental quality by mitigating the ecological footprint in the short run and harming the environment in the long run. Besides, life expectancy does not significantly affect ecological footprint in the long or short run. Meanwhile, the results confirmed the bi-directional causal relationship between the study's variable and ecological footprint. Based on the outcomes, the way to adopt effective policies to improve the quality of the environment has been paved. Furthermore, a comprehensive policy framework for stricter environmental regulation is expected to be developed using the outcomes derived from this study.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of ecosystem services within safe and just operating space at the regional scale,"ContextThe Regional Safe and Just Operating Space (RSJOS), serving as a conceptual framework that supports environmental governance and policy formulation, has garnered growing recognition. However, the application of ecosystem services in the RSJOS framework still constitutes a knowledge gap in the realm of landscape sustainability science.ObjectivesOur objective was to discuss the role of ecosystem services within the Safe and Just Operating Space (SJOS) framework to promote regional sustainability.MethodsWe analyzed the relationship between ecosystem services and the SJOS framework, including their similarities in core concepts and research objectives, as well as how ecosystem services relate to environmental ceilings and social foundations. Based on these analyses, we discussed the potential and challenges of bridging safe space and just space using an ecosystem services approach.ResultsWe found that ecosystem services have the potential to help understand the interaction between ecological ceilings and social foundations when assessing RSJOS, using ecosystem service flows to link ""safe"" and ""just"" boundaries. However, challenges in applying ecosystem services to assess RSJOS can limit the benefits of this framework.ConclusionsThe examination of RSJOS should extend beyond snapshots of the current regional state and encompass their inherent interconnections and impact mechanisms. This broader perspective can subsequently inform policy decisions. Ecosystem services play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges within the RSJOS framework.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of electricity market design for energy storage in cost-efficient decarbonization,"Energy storage is widely recognized by power system utilities and regulators as a crucial resource for achieving energy decarbonization. However, in deregulated power systems, investor-owned storage participates in electricity markets with a profit-driven motive. The alignment of such profit-driven operations with social welfare critically depends on market design and storage's participation choices. This study employs an agent-based approach and investigates the impact of different market participation options on storage's contribution to reducing electricity costs and carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the existing electricity pool market design in North America may encourage early-stage storage adoptions but hinder progress toward deep decarbonization. We found that day-ahead markets are more effective in utilizing storage to reduce carbon emissions, while real-time markets are more effective in reducing costs. We compare different combinations of storage market participation choices and conclude trade-offs between consumer energy affordability and carbon emissions.",Not About Sufficiency
The role of informal green spaces in reducing inequalities in urban green space availability to children and seniors,"Urban green spaces (UGS) offer a wide range of ecosystem services to city dwellers, contributing to their health and well-being. The resources of formally designated UGS, such as parks and forests, are frequently under-provided, however. This results in unequal access to UGS, which has become an environmental justice issue. We investigated the potential of informal green spaces (IGS) to complement existing formal UGS to reduce distributional inequity in UGS availability. We focused on the most vulnerable groups of citizens, children and elderly residents, for whom the availability of UGS plays a particularly important role. The study was performed in two Eastern-European cities, Warsaw and Lodi, both characterised by a well-developed system of UGS but of different spatial composition and UGS configuration. We focus on unmanaged areas within IGS and link them to the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services, such as enabling direct contact with nature. We identified different categories of formal and informal UGS based on publicly available data, supported by NDVI values, followed by UGS availability analysis of formal and informal UGS in the service area of 300 m for each residential building. We found that informal UGS are equally important as formal ones, and they may contribute to better access to selected urban ecosystem services. Both cities are characterised by unequal distribution of formal UGS. In Lodi, children are least favoured in terms of UGS availability, while in Warsaw, elderly citizens are most excluded. In both cities, it is the green areas associated with transportation routes communication routes, multifamily housing and agricultural lands along with grasslands that have the greatest potential to improve the equal availability of UGS to residents. We propose maintaining various types of unmanaged green areas in cities to help limit disparities to UGS access, and it would also increase their importance in the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services.",Not About Sufficiency

The Sufficiency-Based Circular Economy-An Analysis of 150 Companies,"The circular economy has become a popular paradigm in the business and policy spheres. It can support sustainable development by aiming to safeguard the resources to mitigate negative impacts on the climate and the environment and to sustain our current and future generations. Yet, despite progress with circular economy initiatives, there is a risk of focusing on incremental innovations with little real impact, and possibly even creating serious negative rebound effects. This study suggests that the concept of ""sufficiency"" is inadequately represented in the current circular economy discourse and innovations, and this may be undermining real progress. In this paper, the Sufficiency-based Circular Economy paradigm is introduced. We investigate the following questions: What is the role of business in the sufficiency-based circular economy? What are the institutional limitations to the role of business as a driver for the transition and how might these be overcome? We conduct a ""practice research"" by analyzing company cases of sufficiency practices in a business context. We analyse 150 business cases to identify how their organizational strategies support sufficiency and what type of innovations they exemplify within this transition. We investigate seven core business elements for economic transformation (purpose, ownership, governance, finance, networks, scale-up and impact) of these businesses to understand how they drive the value propositions and their impact on the wider transition. This is followed by a discussion on a broader business and policy perspective of the Sufficiency-based Circular Economy.",Not About Sufficiency

However, research shows that the relationship among human well-being, resource use, and the associated emissions is complex and context specific. To better understand if natural resource use plays a historic role in generating human well-being in the United States, the authors conduct a time-series analysis of greenhouse gas emissions and average life expectancy from 1913 to 2017. The results show that increases in greenhouse gas emissions per capita have an instantaneous, negative effect on life expectancy. The authors also find evidence that income inequality has a long-run negative effect on life expectancy. Additional analyses provide mixed results regarding whether and how the effects of emissions on life expectancy are conditional on income inequality. These findings contradict the assumption that reductions in emissions necessitate trade-offs in human well-being in high-income contexts.",Not About Sufficiency
The Upcycling and Reappropriation - On Art-Specific Circular Economy in the Age of Climate Change,"Whereas mainstream theories of environmental art and sustainable development consider art as a domain suitable for the application of environmentally friendly procedures, such as the circular economy, trash management and digitization, this research article focuses on the internal development of the autopoetic and self -referential art machine, which generates an art-specific sustainability. The circular environmental economy coexists with the circular art economy, which implies changes in the aesthetics and poetics of the artwork; it deploys upcycling to use art trash in creating a new, higher value object. Art-specific sustainability contributes to the power and complexity of the art machine with new conceptual interventions and devices. These devices allow art to resist threats from other fields and to redefine itself. As sustainable development agendas of international organizations take into account the social, political, and economic initiatives that promote ethics, inclusion, and tolerance, this article discusses the contributions of contemporary environmental art to expanded concepts of the political and science. In particular, art activism, in cooperation with civil society, can be an important driver in areas that parliamentary politics overlooks.",Not About Sufficiency
THE UTILITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORTS IN PROVIDING FISCAL SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE,"Environmental Justice is a term having wider ambit, involving the concerns of people from all sections of society, while designing any development policy.

"Three Sides of the Same Coin? A Bayesian Analysis of Strategic Management, Comprehensive Planning, and Inclusionary Values in Land Use","Local government managers face fundamental, value conflicts when they engage urban land use issues. Despite the planet's ongoing urbanization, managerial influence on land use policy remains an under-examined arena. Local governments are routinely asked to balance economic, ecological, and social equity concerns when making choices between alternative land use policy tools. Are local government sustainable development efforts more strategic, comprehensive, and inclusive than when led by professional public managers rather than elected mayors? How do the institutional forms of government inhibit or enhance the ability of specific policy demanders to influence the use of these tools under varying economic conditions? We answer these questions by examining the relationship between local government structure and land use policy utilization in different economic environments with a Bayesian analysis of surveys of Florida cities at three time periods. Differences between manager and mayoral executive leadership shape public management strategies, comprehensiveness, and inclusionary motives linked to land use policy tool utilization before and after the housing boom of the mid-2000s. However, management turnover mitigates this effect. Moreover, managerial influence is not evident at the housing bubble's peak, which we argue is an important caveat to the empirical evidence on form of government.",Not About Sufficiency
Thriving Through Adversity: Ancestral Wisdom and Environmental Justice,"This four-poem collection pays homage to ancestral knowledge-sharing while critiquing the dominance of violent Western epistemic academic structures. Written in an autobiographical and free-verse style reminiscent of my grandfather's storytelling, the poems draw inspiration from personal experiences and a commitment to environmental justice. They weave a narrative of ancestral resilience and personal growth and conceptualize my work. The first poem delves into intergenerational trauma and environmental resilience during El Salvador's Civil War, reflecting on coping strategies, ancestral healing legacies, and my environmental justice journey. The second poem traces my journey from a challenging upbringing to a PhD in Environmental Science, emphasizing ancestral guidance, commitment to justice, and resilience against oppression. The third poem focuses on reconnecting with family and Indigenous heritage, advocating for cultural preservation and restorative environmental justice. The fourth poem introduces ""Cryptonocene"" as a framework for studying the social-environmental-health impacts of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, particularly in El Salvador. It emphasizes the environmental consequences of cryptocurrency mining, urging a nuanced understanding of the digital age's impact on ecosystems and societies-contributing to critical environmental justice and sustainable development discourse. Ultimately, the collection tells a story of resistance, healing, and advocacy for a more equitable and sustainable future.

Effects of response requirement and the availability of an alternative reinforcer on cigarette smoking by schizophrenics,"Cigarette smoking and other forms of drug abuse are more prevalent among schizophrenics than the general population. Despite the clinical importance of this problem, there has been relatively little experimental study of schizophrenic drug use. We examined under controlled laboratory conditions the effects of response requirement and the availability of an alternative (monetary) reinforcer on cigarette smoking by schizophrenics. Subjects were six heavy smokers with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Before each session, subjects provided carbon monoxide samples indicating recent smoking abstinence. During 3-h sessions, subjects obtained opportunities to smoke (2 puffs/opportunity) under a fixed ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement, which varied across sessions from FR50 to FR6400. In half of the sessions, subjects also were able to earn a small amount of money ($0.25/ratio completed) under an FR400 schedule. Increasing the response requirement for smoking decreased smoking and increased smoking- maintained responding. The availability of the monetary reinforcer decreased smoking and smoking-maintained responding by approximately half. These results are consistent with those seen previously in community volunteers without major mental illness studied under the same experimental conditions, suggesting that smoking by these two populations is controlled, at least in part, by a common set of determinants.",Not About Sufficiency
Conservation agrivoltaics for sustainable food-energy production,"Transformative strategies in agriculture are needed to address urgent global challenges related to energy and food production while reinforcing natural resources and the environment. Agrivoltaics (AV) has emerged in the past decade as one solution to this fundamental challenge of improving energy and food security. AV is defined as the co-location of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and crops on the same land to optimize food and energy production simultaneously and sustainably. Here, we propose that AV, together with conservation agriculture management practices (CAMP) strategies can help to intensify food security and energy production while reinforcing natural resources and the environment. Our main assertions in this opinion article are that: (1) AV systems need to overcome several agronomical, environmental, and ecological challenges to intensify food and energy production sustainably; (2) CAMP applied to AV systems can preserve the environment and ensure climate-resilient food production; (3) implementation of CAMP in AV can lead to long-term carbon sequestration, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and maintain or increase crop yields while preserving soil health and biodiversity; and (4) adoption of CAMP in AV can bring economic benefits, although challenges need to be overcome. This opinion article proposes a new ecosystem approach to integrate renewable energy and sustainable food production and encourages research on the effects of CAMP on AV systems.",Not About Sufficiency
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SUSTAINABILITY DIMENSIONS IN GREECE,"Sustainability, or sustainable development has three aspects: economic, social and environmental. The level of economic development is shown by a nation's standard of living or purchasing power and is measured by the real per capita output. Social resilience is indicated by income inequality and quantified by the Gini coefficient. Environmental sustainability isapproximated by the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per capita. The objective of this research is to empirically study the relationships between the degree of economic development, socialresilience and environmental quality in Greece.This objective has been accomplished by deriving the original and the environmental Kuznets curves for Greece. The original Kuznets curve displays the connection between the level of economic development (real GDP per capita) and social stability (the Gini coefficient), whereas the environmental Kuznets curve illustrates the link between the degree of economic development and the level of environmental degradation.The relationships between the standard of living and income inequality,on the one hand, and the standard of living and environmental degradation, on the other hand, have been both investigated by an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The empirical results from the research show that in Greece the rise in social resilience and environmental quality is accompanied by a fall in the living standard (the purchasing power per capita).It is advisable that Greek policymakers shift the Kuznets curves to the right in order to achieve a better trade-off between the living standard, on the one hand, and income inequality and the quality of environment, on the other hand.The original Kuznets curve may be shifted to the right by changing the type Green tax system from consumption-based to hybrid.The environmental Kuznets curve can be moved to the right by investments in low-carbon economy, which contribute to ""green"" economic growth.",Not About Sufficiency
The marginal costs of greenhouse gas emissions,"Estimates of the marginal costs of greenhouse gas emissions are an important input to the decision how much society would want to spend on greenhouse gas emission reduction. Marginal cost estimates in the literature range between $5 and $25 per tonne of carbon. Using similar assumptions, the FUND model finds marginal costs of $9-23/tC, depending on the discount rate. If the aggregation of impacts over countries accounts for inequalities in income distribution or for risk aversion, marginal costs would rise by about a factor of 3. Marginal costs per region are an order of magnitude smaller than global marginal costs. The ratios between the marginal costs of CO2 and those of CH4 and N2O are roughly equal to the global warming potentials of these gases.

Imperata economics and policy,"Should policymakers - or anyone else - care about millions of ha of Imperata grasslands? The answer depends on the balance between costs of conversion to other uses and the net benefits produced in economic growth, poverty alleviation, and protection of the environment.

Although evidence is limited, it suggests smallholder-based agroforestry could provide the same economic growth with greater poverty alleviation than large-scale forestry estates. There is, however, no substitute for project appraisal for specific settings. The second section on Imperata policy reviews whether policy distortions and market failures provide a sufficient rationale for direct policy intervention to promote tree planting on Imperata grasslands. Estimates of imputed values of carbon sequestration to alleviate global warming are presented for Acacia mangium and rubber agroforestry.

Toward a just circular economy: conceptualizing environmental labor and gender justice in circularity studies,"Over the past decade, the concept of circular economy (CE) has gained political traction as a potential solution to economy-environment tradeoffs. However, critical social scientists have raised concerns that CE may not address the root causes or consequences of environmental degradation, thus remaining ineffective. Concurring with this critique, this article highlights three constituent elements of the linear economy that remain unaddressed in CE frameworks: environmental, labor, and gender inequalities. Building upon scholarship from environmental justice, environmental labor studies, and feminist ecological economics, we elaborate a conceptual framework to interrogate the existing literature. Our analysis shows that current CE models 1) are mainly concerned with return on capital investment and sustained growth of gross domestic product (GDP) rather than with redressing the North/South inequalities embedded in the linear economy model; 2) present a limited perspective on labor, with a primary focus on the number of jobs to be created, rather than their quality, or workers' leadership; and 3) overlook gender inequalities and the sexual division of labor, thus reproducing the devaluation of care that lays at the roots of socioecological crises.

TOWARD A SOCIALLY JUST TRANSITION TO LOW CARBON DEVELOPMENT: THE CASE OF INDONESIA,"In 2019, the Indonesian government released its post-Paris Agreement report Low Carbon Development: a paradigm shift towards a green economy in Indonesia, in which it set out an economic rationale for a move to low carbon growth. The core of the paradigm shift referenced in the report's title was that growth not only had to be decoupled from high carbon inputs but that in both practice and outcomes it had to be sustainable and inclusive. Yet the report does little to define social justice, equity practices, or inclusive outcomes in a green economy context. In this article, we foreground distributive, procedural and recognition aspects of social justice that are central to Indonesia's climate mitigation efforts and transition to a green, low carbon economy. We focus on two sectors that are key to this transition - forest and land-use, and energy. Our analysis shows that existing forms of injustice can exacerbate challenges for decarbonisation action and that low carbon transitions initiatives have been unable to overcome various forms of injustice and have, in some cases, created new injustices.",Not About Sufficiency

"Towards a CO2-neutral steel industry: Justice aspects of CO2 capture and storage, biomass- and green hydrogen-based emission reductions","A rapid transition towards a CO2-neutral steel industry is required to limit climate change. Such a transition raises questions of justice, as it entails positive and negative impacts unevenly distributed across societal stakeholders. To enable stakeholders to address such concerns, this paper assesses the justice implications of three options that reduce emissions: CO2 capture and storage (CCS) on steel (up to 70%), bio-based steelmaking (up to 50%), and green hydrogen-based steel production (up to 100%). We select justice indicators from the energy, climate, labour and environmental justice literature and assess these indicators qualitatively for each of the technological routes based on literature and desk research. We find context-dependent differences in justness between the different technological routes. The impact on stakeholders varies across regions. There are justice concerns for local communities because of economic dependence on, and environmental impact of the industry. Communities elsewhere are impacted through the siting of infrastructure and feedstock production. CCS and biobased steelmaking routes can help retain industry and associated economic benefits on location, while hydrogen based steelmaking may deal better with environmental concerns. We conclude that, besides techno-economic and environmental information, transparency on sector-specific justice implications of transforming steel industries is essential for decision-making on technological routes.",Not About Sufficiency
"Towards a Comprehensive Framework of the Relationships between Resource Footprints, Quality of Life, and Economic Development","The relationship between economic affluence, quality of life, and environmental implications of production and consumption activities is a recurring issue in sustainability discussions. A number of studies examined selected relationships, but the general implications for future development options to achieve environmentally and socially sustainable development of countries at different levels of per capita resource footprints, quality of life, and income have not yet been investigated in detail. In this study, we use a global dataset with 173 countries to assess the overall relationship between resource footprints, quality of life, and economic development over the period of 1990-2015. We select the material footprint and carbon footprint and contrast them with the Human Development Index, the Happiness Index, and GDP per capita. Regression analyses show that the relationship between various resource footprints and quality of life generally follows a logarithmic path of development, while resource footprints and GDP per capita are linearly connected. From the empirical results, we derive a generalized path of development and cluster countries along this path. Within this comprehensive framework, we discuss options to change the path to respect planetary and social boundaries through a combination of resource efficiency increases, substitution of industries and sufficiency of consumption. We conclude that decoupling and green growth will not realize sustainable development if planetary boundaries have already been transgressed.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards a just circular transition: Fostering principles and stakeholder roles in sustainable partnerships,"Developing sustainable partnerships is deemed crucial and timely for advancing circular economy transition efforts.

"Towards a Just Energy Transition, Barriers and Opportunities for Positive Energy District Creation in Spain","To mitigate the effects of climate change, the European Commission created a Strategic Energy Technology Plan committing to forming 100 Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) by 2025. These are considered to potentially be major instruments for decarbonization in a just transition. This plan has led to some districts being defined as PEDs, although none have fully met the criteria to be a PED yet. Research shows that new forms of energy ownership and production, as could potentially be found in PEDs, could help reduce energy poverty, which affects a significant segment of the population, as households can reduce their energy expenditure as well as improve their energy behavior. This paper set out to shed light on the PED landscape, investigating the barriers and opportunities to PED creation in Spain and its potential to mitigate energy poverty. We conducted a literature review on community-owned energy in Spain, followed with expert interviews (energy researchers, stakeholders, and NGOs) who focus on sustainability issues in Spain. Results show a number of barriers (lack of knowledge and awareness, and lack of trust from consumers) and opportunities connected with the creation of PEDs. In conclusion, policymaker engagement and support play a key role in successfully implementing PEDs.",Not About Sufficiency
Towards Decarbonization: Sustainable Incentives in a Price-Competitive Maritime Supply Chain with Environmentally Conscious Shippers,"Transitioning carriers to low-emission technologies requires huge investment, and subsidies have proven to be efficient tools in overcoming cost barriers. In this study, game-theoretic models were formulated to study the impact of subsidies on carbon emissions reduction with green shippers in a price-competitive environment. Equilibrium solutions for three scenarios were derived through model analysis, followed by numerical analyses. The results indicate the following: (1) Government subsidies are effective and advantageous for decarbonization with carrier competition but will lower service prices, profits, and social welfare. (2) Intensified price competition leads to increases in carbon emissions, service prices, and social welfare while decreasing demands and profits in some scenarios. (3) Shippers' green preferences have a positive effect on carbon emission reduction, profits, and social welfare. These findings provide valuable managerial insights for both the government and shipping companies in promoting a more sustainable environment.",Not About Sufficiency
"Toxicants, entanglement, and mitigation in New England's emerging circular economy for food waste","Drawing on research with food waste recycling facilities in New England, this paper explores a fundamental tension between the eco-modernist logics of the circular economy and the reality of contemporary waste streams. Composting and digestion are promoted as key solutions to food waste, due to their ability to return nutrients to agricultural soils. However, our work suggests that food waste processors increasingly find themselves responsible for policing boundaries between distinct ""material"" and ""biological"" systems as imagined by the architects of the circular economy-boundaries penetrable by toxicants. This responsibility creates significant problems for processors due to the regulatory, educational, and structural barriers documented in this research. This paper contributes to scholarship which suggests the need to rethink the modernist logics of the circular economy and to recognize the realities of entangled material and biological systems. More specifically, we argue that if circularity is the goal, policy needs to recognize the barriers food waste processors face and concentrate circularity efforts further upstream to ensure fair, just, and safe circular food systems.",Not About Sufficiency
Tracing the development of Anti-Fossil Fuel Norms: insights from the Republic of Ireland,"Recent scholarly work on sustainability transitions has highlighted the importance of the development of norms against fossil fuels, or Anti-Fossil Fuel Norms (AFFNs), for climate mitigation. However, further research is needed to understand the mechanisms and conditions by which such norms are developed and secured for successful sustainability transitions. This paper contributes to addressing this, through analysing the case of the Republic of Ireland, probing the emergence of norms against fossil fuels and notably against natural gas (also referred to here as 'fossil gas'). Whilst Ireland is considered an overall laggard on climate action, in recent years the country has witnessed several ground-breaking supply-side moves against fossil fuels. Drawing on in-depth original research interviews and analysis of key political sources, including parliamentary debates and policy documents, the paper finds evidence of norms against fossil gas emerging in the Irish case. The analysis contributes insights into the iterative development of AFFNs at the domestic level, the role of environmental movements, and broader lessons for the development of a just transition away from fossil gas.Key policy insightsInitial moves against fossil fuels, even if not successful, can unleash political feedback effects which open space for more stringent policy development over timeDelayed action on sustainability leads to more complex transition challenges, with implications for ensuring justice within transition processesGrassroots environmental movements are important 'norm entrepreneurs', providing important sources of expertise, effective communication for policy and the public on the impacts of fossil fuels and mobilisation of wider citizen support for climate policyAFFN discursive framings can help to build alliances, advance climate justice, and support the development of environmentally and socially just transitions.",Not About Sufficiency
Transactional colonialism in wind energy investments: Energy injustices against vulnerable people in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,"Energy production is a source of disputes across the world. Governments and firms argue that investing in wind energy contributes to the sustainable development of energy systems. However, wind farms perpetuate ongoing injustices and instigate new injustices. Vulnerable groups such as excluded and marginalised indigenous people can trace the injustices in low-carbon investments to a historical continuity of oppression and repression by internal and external elite groups. Based on a qualitative longitudinal study in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, we expand our understanding of the energy justice framework in two ways. First, we show that cognitive justice is a vital dimension for understanding different ways of life, traditions and customs. Second, we propose the new concept of 'transactional colonialism', which emphasises the role of economic transactions between firms and economically motivated members of indigenous communities with the support of elite actors. This article provides new insights into the conflicting dynamics of wind energy investments in the Global South.",Not About Sufficiency
Transformative disruptiveness or transition? Revealing digitalization and deep decarbonization pathways in the Italian smart electricity meter roll-out,"Energy infrastructure digitalization is proposed as key for a just deep decarbonization. However, an integrative literature review reveals the lack of a more profound exploration on normative considerations tied to world perspectives and values, as levers of a lasting transformation in the context of socio-technical transitions. Thus, the paper employs qualitative research methods to investigate how energy infrastructure digitalization contributes to transformative disruption, along which deliberated deep decarbonization pathways, using Italy's smart electricity meter roll-out as a case study. While the roll-out represents a substantial effort in introducing digital devices into the residential sector, concerns persist about its effectiveness, also due to potential societal disruptions. Through in-depth interviews with experts (N = 17) and citizens (N = 23) and content-oriented analysis, the research unveils evolving pathways between ever more disengaged two grand narratives and value systems: energy as a commodity and energy as a common good. The first opts for technological progress, changing consumer behavior, to address energy poverty and social justice, building on market-based instruments and new business models. Conversely, the second harbors skepticism towards technological fixes, emphasizes energy sufficiency and questions energy opulence, linked to environmental justice considerations, and calling for corrective principles by regulatory means. Finally, the paper presents a conceptual framework to re-shape deep deliberative transformation, highlighting the importance of re-connecting to defined values, re-generating actionable knowledge, restructuring institutions in societal experimentation, and recognizing underlying processes such as justice claims. It argues for further research into discourse coalitions capitalizing on defined narratives, to better understand their impact on policy-making processes.",Not About Sufficiency
Transitioning to a low carbon society through energy communities: Lessons learned from Brazil and Italy,"New legal arrangements for the aggregation of distributed generation and demand are required for the future electricity grid so as to increase flexibility, resilience, citizens? participation and also alleviate energy poverty. To promote the transitioning to a low carbon society, countries are reforming their legal framework to enable broad civic engagement in the energy markets. This work analyses the process of reform of the legal framework of the electric sector with focus on energy communities, using two study cases, one in Brazil and another in Italy. The research performed is applied, qualitative, descriptive and exploratory. The work uses multiple research methods, blending case studies, semi-structured interviews and a systematic literature review for data collection and the functional method of comparative law, discourse analysis and triangulation for data analysis. The findings suggest greater consideration of the energy poverty nexus in the policy design of the electricity sector and they also reveal the important role of specialized technical bodies and governmental institutions for the takeoff and success of an energy community endeavour, highlighting crucial aspects for an energy transition aligned with the Paris Agreement and the goals of Agenda 2030.",Not About Sufficiency
Transmigrants Experiences of Recognitional (in)Justice in Indonesia's Environmental Impact Assessment,"This paper unpacks the environmental justice concerns of rural migrants in relation to land tenure and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes. We explore the ""geography of recognition"", whereby sense of community, identity and place interact to produce unequal experiences of recognitional justice in relation to the EIA process. We develop our argument by using qualitative research and a village case study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, involving transmigrant communities and indigenous Kutai people. This study highlights how a failure to recognize transmigrants' identity creates barriers to their meaningful participation in the EIA. Structural flaws in the decentralized land-use system mean a failure to address the contested claims for recognition and land rights between transmigrant and indigenous communities, which in turn fuels social and environmental conflict. Resolving land tenure conflicts requires the empowerment of socially marginalized groups in the decision-making over land-use projects affecting them.",Not About Sufficiency
Treaty Preambles and The Environmental Justice Gap,"Global environmental architectures have the potential to reduce inequalities, however, legal, and political procedures and structures may also increase injustices and disempowerment. Multilateral environmental agreements create large regimes over some of the most expansive planetary systems. Contracting states list the purposes, motivations and considerations that led them to conclude legally binding agreements in treaty preambles that are an interpretive tool, a declaration of context, motivation, and intent of the contracting states or parties. This study produces an environmental justice conceptual framework that references the scholarship on environmental justice and environmental governance, outlines the elements required to introduce environmental justice debates into treaty preambles, and gives an example of its application to determine whether the preambles include justice concepts. The preambles selected are from treaties with broad geographic and subject matter scope: they regulate oceans, climate, and biodiversity, the transport of waste, mercury pollution, migratory and endangered species, and wetlands. Using the environmental justice conceptual framework, the study found a justice gap between how justice is addressed in justice debates and literatures and the stated intent of the contracting parties in the preambles. The conclusions support the literature that argues that multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) are ahistorical as regards the moral responsibility that lies at the heart of the definitions of justice.",Not About Sufficiency
"Trends and social aspects in the management and conversion of agricultural residues into valuable resources: A comprehensive approach to counter environmental degradation, food security, and climate change","The circular economy is essential as it encourages the reuse and recycling of resources while reducing waste, which ultimately helps to reduce environmental pollution and boosts economic efficiency. The current review highlights the management of agricultural and livestock residues and their conversion into valuable resources to combat environmental degradation and improve social well-being. The current trends in converting agricultural residues into useful resources emphasize the social benefits of waste management and conversion. It also em-phasizes how waste conversion can reduce environmental degradation and enhance food security. Using agricultural residues can increase soil health and agricultural output while reducing pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource depletion. Promoting sustainable waste-to-resource conversion processes requires a combination of strategies that address technical, economic, social, and environmental aspects. These multiple strategies are highlighted along with prospects and considerations.",Not About Sufficiency
Trends in Global Agricultural Land Use: Implications for Environmental Health and Food Security,"The eighteenth-century Malthusian prediction of population growth outstripping food production has not yet come to bear. Unprecedented agricultural land expansions since 1700, and technological innovations that began in the 1930s, have enabled more calorie production per capita than was ever available before in history. This remarkable success, however, has come at a great cost. Agriculture is a major cause of global environmental degradation. Malnutrition persists among large sections of the population, and a new epidemic of obesity is on the rise. We review both the successes and failures of the global food system, addressing ongoing debates on pathways to environmental health and food security. To deal with these challenges, a new coordinated research program blending modern breeding with agroecological methods is needed.

"Revisiting the environmental impact of renewable energy, non-renewable energy, remittances, and economic growth: CO2 emissions versus ecological footprint for top remittance-receiving countries","The study examined the impact of renewable energy, non-renewable energy, remittances, and economic growth on environmental degradation from the perspective of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) and ecological footprint for the top 50 remittance-receiving countries for 1991–2018. This study simulates the environmental future for attaining the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) using the latest datasets. This study is one of the few that empirically explores how various explanatory variables affect CO2 and ecological footprint. The study employed the pool mean group autoregressive distributive lag (PMG-ARDL), fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) techniques for the analysis. In the long-run, non-renewable energy and economic growth have a positive impact, whereas renewable energy and remittances have a negative impact on CO2 and ecological footprint. The impact of non-renewable energy on CO2 and ecological footprint is more significant than renewable energy in both the short- and long-run. Most of the variables have a bidirectional causality among each other. This highlights the need for a paradigm shift towards renewable energy in the top recipients specifically for developing countries.",Not About Sufficiency
"Understanding stakeholder perceptions of environmental justice: a study of tourism in the Erhai Lake basin, Yunnan province, China","Environmental justice is an important component of sustainable tourism, but stakeholder perspectives related to environmental justice may vary. Using Q-methodology, we investigated different stakeholder perceptions related to environmental justice within the context of tourism and ecological restoration. Specifically, in the Erhai Lake basin, China, we explore perspectives around an ecological restoration effort that included the government mandated closure of 1900 establishments (inns and restaurants) in response to environmental degradation. We identify and explore four environmental justice perspectives: the togetherness, protection, operator loss, and local loss perspectives. These four perspectives are contextualized within three dimensions of environmental justice (i.e., distribution, recognition, and participation). Our findings highlight differing views related to who is affected most by the inn closures (e.g., future generations, local residents, inn owners), and general consensus related to the outcomes of the process being more important than the process itself. Finally, we discuss potential reasons for these differing perspectives and recommend ways to improve environmental justice among different stakeholders. This research can facilitate sustainable development of tourism by highlighting the facets of ecological restoration policy implementation most important to stakeholders, including recognition of diverse stakeholder concerns and identities, clear and well supported rationale for policy design, and increased equity in the distribution of costs and benefits of policies.",Not About Sufficiency
Unlocking Energy from Waste: A Comprehensive Analysis of Municipal Solid Waste Recovery Potential in Ghana,"Ghana is currently facing a waste crisis that presents considerable risks to its environment, economy, and public health. This investigation evaluates four prospective waste-to-energy options-namely, incineration, anaerobic digestion, gasification, and landfill gas-with the objective of mapping out a sustainable strategy for efficient waste management. Among these solutions, anaerobic digestion stands out as a superior option, offering renewable energy production, valuable bio-product creation, and a comparatively lower greenhouse gas emission effect. A cost analysis further reveals that utilizing biogas from anaerobic digestion is not only environmentally friendly but also economically more viable than relying on light crude oil. Producing 200 MW of energy using biogas costs 36% less, potentially resulting in monthly savings of USD 5.46 million for Ghana. However, several obstacles impede the development of WtE. Inaccurate waste data and a lack of clear policies on waste-to-energy hinder the harnessing of Ghana's WtE potential. To address this, the study recommends (1) implementing a well-defined national strategy complete with regulations and incentives to attract investments and (2) conducting specialized research to optimize WtE technologies for Ghana's unique waste composition and context. By surmounting these challenges, Ghana stands poised to secure a sustainable future, simultaneously meeting the targets of Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 11. This entails ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all (SDG 7) and fostering inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and human settlements (SDG 11).",Not About Sufficiency
Unlocking the significant worldwide potential of better waste and resource management for climate mitigation: with particular focus on the Global South,"Numbers do matter; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s 2010 data that the waste sector is responsible for just 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has led to the misperception that solid waste management (SWM) has little to contribute to climate mitigation. Global efforts to control methane emissions and divert organic waste from landfills had already reduced direct emissions. But end-of-pipe SWM has also been evolving into more circular waste and resource management, with indirect GHG savings from the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) which IPCC accounts for elsewhere in the economy. The evidence compiled here on both direct emissions and indirect savings demonstrates with high confidence that better waste and resource management can make a significant contribution to climate mitigation, and must form a core part of every country's nationally determined contribution. Even the most advanced countries can still achieve much from the 3Rs. In the Global South, the challenge of extending waste collection to all and stopping open dumping and burning (sustainable development goal 11.6.1), essential to improve public health, can be turned into a huge opportunity. Moving early to divert waste from landfill by separation at source and collecting clean organic and dry recycling fractions, will mitigate global GHG emissions, slash ocean plastics and create decent livelihoods. But this can only happen with targeted climate, plastics and extended producer responsibility finance; and help to local communities to help themselves.",Not About Sufficiency

US decarbonization impacts on air quality and environmental justice,"As policy organizations consider strategies to mitigate climate change, decarbonization initiatives can also reduce health-impacting air pollutants and may affect the associated racial disparities of adverse effects. With the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency CO-Benefits Risk Assessment Health Impacts Screening Tool (COBRA), we compare three decarbonization scenarios and their impacts at the regional and county scales. COBRA calculates changes in county-level ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and associated mortality impacts, for each decarbonization scenario. We compare these patterns with demographic data to evaluate the relative exposure reduction benefit across race and ethnicity. Carbon-free electricity would reduce national average ambient PM2.5 concentrations by 0.21 mu g m(-3), compared with a 0.19 mu g m(-3) reduction associated with carbon-free industrial activity, and a 0.08 mu g m(-3) reduction associated with carbon-free light duty vehicle (LDV) transportation. Decarbonization strategies also vary in terms of the racial groups most benefitting from each scenario, due to regional and urban/rural patterns in emission sources and population demographics. Black populations are the only group to experience relative exposure reduction benefits compared to the total population in every scenario, with industrial decarbonization yielding 23% greater reductions in ambient PM2.5 concentrations for Black populations than for the total U.S. population. The largest relative reduction in PM2.5 exposure was found for Asian populations in the carbon-free LDV transportation scenario (53%). The magnitudes of total air quality improvements by scenario vary across regions of the U.S., and generally do not align with the decarbonization policy that achieves the largest equity goal. Only the transportation decarbonization scenario meets the criteria of the Justice40 Initiative nationwide, fulfilling the 2021 commitment by U.S. President Biden that federal investments in clean energy are designed to allocate at least 40% of benefits to disadvantaged communities.",Not About Sufficiency

Utilization of ecosystem services in future vision decision-making for climate-resilient cities,"In the face of uncertain future climate change, city policy decision-makers must choose strategies that promote climate-resilient development. Nature-based solutions (NbSs) are considered important for solving urban problems, such as carbon neutrality, improving human well-being, and enhancing biodiversity. This study aimed to examine the possibility of using ecosystem services in decision-making for the future scenarios of the city, considering land use change and climate change in combination. Representative ecosystem services of eco-friendly urban paradigms were selected, and ecosystem services and synergies were analyzed when (1) only land use change was considered, and (2) climate change (RCP 8.5) and land use change were both considered. The selected ecosystem services were analyzed using statistical and model-based methods (InVest, MaxEnt) applied to each characteristic and collectible data. The results revealed that food (rice and fishery production) was affected by land use change, recreation and leisure was affected by external activities and climate change. Carbon uptake was affected by both climate change and land use change. Regarding synergy, the amount of carbon uptake decreased by - 1.60% in BAU (S1) and increased by 24.39% in Smart Shrinkage City (S3); however, regarding recreation, the differences depended on the scenarios, such as an increase in S1 by 5.26% and an increase in S3 by 0.99%.

Social and Political Dimensions of Environmental Protection in Central America,"This study takes a critical look at mainstream efforts to protect and rehabilitate the environment in Central America. Despite some notable successes, many forest protection and tree planting schemes have not been effectively implemented and have even contributed to further environmental degradation, social inequality and impoverishment. It is argued that the trade‐off between environmental protection and human welfare which characterizes many schemes to protect forests and promote tree planting undermines not only local livelihoods but also the possibility of achieving basic environmental objectives, given the nature of local responses and their effects on project implementation. There is a need for a more integrative and socially‐aware approach to environmental planning which addresses two fundamental problems: the failure to locate environmental protection initiatives within a broader development framework and the failure to integrate concerns for environmental protection with the needs and rights of local people. Addressing these two problems of ‘macro‐’ and ‘micro‐coherency’ in environmental planning requires not only dealing with the many technical, administrative and financial constraints which typically characterize environmental programmes and projects, but also changes in the balance of social forces. © 1994 Institute of Social Studies",Not About Sufficiency
Control of the end-tidal P(CO2) in the hyperventilation syndrome: Effects of biofeedback and breathing instructions compared,"Twenty chronic hyperventilation syndrome patients were assigned to biofeedback training to raise end-tidal PCO2 level or received a breathing exercise schedule for home practice. Both methods offered equal opportunity for improving end-tidal PCO2 significantly. Alleviation of complaints, however, was only noticeable in the biofeedback group. This may be due to the fact that improvement in the severity of the hyperventilation syndrome was not only significantly related to increase in end-tidal PCO2 but also to initial end-tidal PCO2 level and state of the ventilatory controlling system. A follow-up evaluation three months after the end of the therapy programs showed an unchanged end-tidal PCO2 level in both groups as compared with post-treatment evaluation, but a significant relapse in complaints in the biofeedback group.

Suicide by poisoning in Switzerland,"During the course of the year 1971, 1030 cases of attempted suicide were reported to the Swiss Poison Information Center. In the same period the Swiss Federal Statistical Office recorded 266 deaths as a result of suicide by poisoning. In cases of attempted suicide the ratio of men to women was 0.4 to 1, whereas the ratio for cases of fatal suicide was 1.4 to 1. The majority of suicides were attempted by people between 20 and 40 yr of age, and most cases of serious poisoning also occurred in this age group. In cases resulting in death the distribution according to age for men showed 3 maxima, namely in the 20's, 40's and 60's. The majority of deaths involving women occurred between 40 and 50 yr of age. Drugs were by far the most frequently used agents for attempted suicides (89%), and much less often household products (4%) and pesticides (3.4%). The distribution was notably different in cases of fatal suicide: drugs (53.4%), carbon monoxide (34.6%), chemical raw materials (4.1%) and household products (4.5%). The actual motives for suicides could only be determined in cases of attempted suicide. The most usual reasons given were family problems, partner problems (boyfriend or girlfriend, matrimonial problems, pending separation or divorce, relationship between parents and children, authoritarian father), and less often problems at the place of work and school, or financial difficulties. Among the psychic and somatic disturbances most frequently encountered were endogenic and exogenic depression, schizophrenia, inferiority complexes through deformity or other physical disabilities, and alcoholism.",Not About Sufficiency
Designing a circular carbon and plastics economy for a sustainable future,"The linear production and consumption of plastics today is unsustainable. It creates large amounts of unnecessary and mismanaged waste, pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, undermining global climate targets and the Sustainable Development Goals. This Perspective provides an integrated technological, economic and legal view on how to deliver a circular carbon and plastics economy that minimizes carbon dioxide emissions. Different pathways that maximize recirculation of carbon (dioxide) between plastics waste and feedstocks are outlined, including mechanical, chemical and biological recycling, and those involving the use of biomass and carbon dioxide. Four future scenarios are described, only one of which achieves sufficient greenhouse gas savings inline with global climate targets. Such a bold system change requires 50% reduction in future plastic demand, complete phase-out of fossil-derived plastics, 95% recycling rates of retrievable plastics and use of renewable energy. It is hard to overstate the challenge of achieving this goal. We therefore present a roadmap outlining the scale and timing of the economic and legal interventions that could possibly support this. Assessing the service lifespan and recoverability of plastic products, along with considerations of sufficiency and smart design, can moreover provide design principles to guide future manufacturing, use and disposal of plastics.",Not About Sufficiency
"ECONOMIC GROWTH, ENVIRONMENT AND GREEN ECONOMY","Permanent efforts to maximize production, economic growth, have had a positive impact on population growth, raising the standard of living, and reducing poverty. In the global environment, maintaining a balance between economic development and the use of the world's resources is an important fact. Just as the gross domestic product and the income situation developed positively, the consumption of natural resources also grew over the years, which was reflected in the growth of the global material footprint, domestic material consumption and material footprint. In the paper, we will focus on investigating the relationship between economic growth, well-being and the material footprint. Based on data from the World Bank, since I960 the global GDP has increased from 10.94 billion dollars, to 87.95 billion dollars in 2022. Over the past nearly fifty years, the growth of world population and global GDP has necessitated an escalation in demand for natural resources. The use of natural resources in the form of material extraction has tripled since 1970, far beyond what industrial ecologists consider a sustainable limit. The concept of separating economic growth and resource use, or separating economic growth and environmental impacts, is gaining momentum globally. An essential prerequisite for maintaining sustainability is the efficient use of natural resources. This means supporting the efficient use of energy and resources, investing in renewable energy sources, supporting waste reduction and increasing recycling efforts, or encouraging technological innovation. The solution is sustainable production and consumption and the transition from a linear economy to a circular economy as much as possible.",Not About Sufficiency
Unveiling the complex web: exploring the international fossil fuel trade network and its impact on CO2 emissions and trade patterns,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to examine the structure of the international fossil fuel trade network (IFFTN) and assess its effects on CO2 emissions and global trade patterns.

These parameters are integrated into a panel fixed effects model, with the robustness of the findings confirmed through dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) analysis.FindingsThe study finds that the dynamic fossil fuel trade network includes key players such as the USA, China, France, India, the Netherlands and South Korea. It demonstrates increased connectivity and dependence among these countries, directly correlating with higher CO2 emissions. However, this correlation is mitigated by the adoption of renewable energy, particularly in Asia and high-income countries. The impact on environmental quality is mediated through scale, technique and composition effects, suggesting significant environmental improvements through enhanced industry structure, technological progress and economies of scale.Research limitations/implicationsThis study recognizes several limitations. First, the categorization of countries into Asian economies, low-income and high-income groups may oversimplify the intricate effects of economic status on environmental impacts. Second, focusing primarily on per capita CO2 emissions may neglect other critical environmental indicators. Future research should consider examining regional variations and including a wider range of environmental metrics. This approach would offer a more detailed perspective on the nuanced interactions between economic development and environmental sustainability, enhancing the depth and applicability of the findings.Practical implicationsTo address the challenges of the IFFTN and CO2 emissions, several practical policy measures are recommended. Governments should enhance international cooperation by establishing global platforms for sharing best practices and initiating technology transfer agreements to accelerate the adoption of energy-efficient technologies. Additionally, a phased transition towards more sustainable energy sources is crucial, involving increased investment in the renewable energy sector alongside incentives for adopting green technologies. On the trade front, governments should modify trade partnerships to address congestion externalities, fostering a shift towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly trade practices.Social implicationsThe social implications of the IFFTN are profound. As global reliance on fossil fuels continues, communities face heightened health risks due to increased pollution. Transitioning to renewable energy can alleviate these health concerns and the creation of green technologies, enhancing social well-being. Moreover, equitable access to energy-efficient solutions can reduce energy poverty, particularly in low-income countries, fostering greater societal resilience and inclusivity.Originality/valueThis study offers a pioneering examination of the trade-energy nexus across 74 countries, using complex network models to analyse diverse economic settings, particularly in Asian economies dominated by non-renewable energy. It identifies key market players and assesses their impact on dynamics such as congestion and market power. Additionally, the study explores the positive effects of renewable energy capacity on these relationships, highlighting its crucial role in driving sustainable energy transitions and enhancing the understanding of indirect trade-environment interactions.",Not About Sufficiency

ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS SOLVING AS A FACTOR IN THE FORMATION OF A SUSTAINABLE AND BALANCED DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM,"Environmental problem-solving as a factor of sustainable and balanced development is an integral part of every country in the world, based on the interaction of man, nature, society, and the overcoming of crisis factors in an imbalanced world. That is why today it is necessary to move from the economics of aggressive expansion to the economics of sustainable development in order to promote the formation of a stable identity and social sustainability, which requires a fundamentally new development paradigm. The new paradigm of sustainable development as the main driver and megatrend of solving environmental problems includes climate change management and overcoming the destructive effects of climate change, natural resource management, the introduction of renewable energy sources, and environmental technologies that require a transition to a circular economy, which requires a new economic philosophy - overcoming the largescale destructive effects of the planet. The formation of a new paradigm is based on the idea that the country's future should be purposefully programmed as a balanced one. In order to achieve these objectives, a sustainable development paradigm should be formed which will lead to economic efficiency, inclusiveness, implementation of renewable energy sources, environmental protection, releasing the energy of entrepreneurship, innovation, and achieving sustainable and balanced development based on harmony, prosperity, risk reduction, well-being, and environmental safety.",Not About Sufficiency
A consequential approach to life cycle sustainability assessment with an agent‐based model to determine the potential contribution of chemical recycling to UN Sustainable Development Goals,"Chemical recycling (CR) could support a circular approach for municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment. In promoting the recirculation of recyclable carbon‐containing waste as secondary feedstock for chemical production, it could contribute to resource conservation, emissions reduction, and supply security. To evaluate CR's contribution to the transition from a linear to a circular carbon economy—and correspondingly to the achievement of environmental, economic, and social sustainability as indicated in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN‐SDGs)—this study builds on extant literature of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) to investigate consequential environmental, economic, and social CR impacts. Specifically, an integrated approach whereby process‐based life cycle assessment, techno‐economic analysis, and social indicators are linked in the framework of an agent‐based model is developed to investigate sustainability consequences of CR via gasification of residual MSW in Germany. Results suggest that CR contributes to reducing climate change and to addressing terrestrial acidification and fossil resource scarcity. However, its deployment will be associated with significant system costs. Hence, to promote CR implementation, measures such as obliging direct waste incineration to trade CO2 certificates—provided that certificate prices increase sharply in the future—as well as implementing a recycling rate are found to be necessary to gap economic disadvantages. This study not only contributes to extending life cycle approaches for LCSA methodologically, it furthermore provides valuable insights into temporal and spatial interactions in waste management systems to inform science, industry, and politics about the sustainability impacts of CR on the achievement of the UN‐SDGs.

Waiting for Godot? The case for climate change adaptation and mitigation in small island states,"Global warming is the most significant threat to ecosystems and people's health and living standards in the coming decades, especially in small island states in the Caribbean and elsewhere. This paper contributes to the debate by analyzing different options to scale up climate change mitigation and adaptation. In particular, the empirical analysis indicates that increasing energy efficiency and reducing the use of fossil fuel in electricity generation could lead to a significant reduction in carbon emissions, while investing in physical and financial resilience would yield long-run benefits. From a risk-reward perspective, the advantages of reducing the risks associated with climate change and the health benefits from higher environmental quality clearly outweigh the potential cost of climate change mitigation and adaptation in the short run. The additional revenue generated by environmental taxes could be used to compensate the most vulnerable households, building a multilayered safety net, and strengthening structural resilience.",Not About Sufficiency
Sea Level change: Environmental and socio-economic impacts,"The coast was among the first of the earth's environments to be subjected to human modification; modification that was both direct and indirect, as it is today. During the last 4.000 to 5.000 years, human impacts on the coast were at what was basically a stable sea level. Because many of the modifications were made to protect against unusual events such as typhoons and tsunami, humans developed a variety of techniques for protecting shorelines. Recent calculations that a rapid sea level rise (in response to greenhouse warming) is imminent, has prompted concerned efforts at meeting the socio-economic impacts that are likely to occur. These impacts, rather than being localized and temporary as has been true in the recent past, are likely to be universal and long-lasting. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Not About Sufficiency
Land Stewardship and Development Behaviors Under an Ecological-Impact-Weighted Land Value Tax Scheme: A Proof-of-Concept Agent-Based Model,"Sprawling land development patterns have exacerbated ecological degradation, social fragmentation, and public health problems. Perverse incentives arise from the ability to privatize collectively created value in land rents and socialize ecological costs. Land value taxation (LVT) has been shown to encourage urban infill development by reducing or eliminating rent-seeking behavior in land markets. However, despite its purported benefits, this tax reform is value monistic in its definition of optimal land use and, therefore, does little to address the lack of non-market information to inform land use decisions. We propose an ecological-impact-weighted land value taxation policy (ELVT) which incorporates the ecological footprint of land use into one’s land value tax burden. We test both proposed policies (LVT and ELVT) relative to a “status quo” (SQ) property tax scheme, utilizing a conceptual spatially explicit agent-based model of land use behaviors and housing development. Our findings suggest that both tax interventions can increase the capital intensity and decrease the land intensity of housing development. Furthermore, both tax interventions can lead to a net profit loss for speculators and a decrease in the average housing unit price. The ELVT scheme is shown to significantly increase urban nature provisions and dampen the loss of ecological value across a region.",Not About Sufficiency
Restorative Energy Justice,"While distributive justice and procedural justice have received substantial attention from energy scholars, recent work identifies restorative justice as an underdeveloped component of the energy justice framework. As conceived in the context of criminal law, restorative justice seeks to more precisely account for harms and obligations that arise from wrongdoing, and to widen the circle of participation in repairing those harms. Restorative environmental justice wields these principles to advance the environmental justice framework beyond a tight focus on disparate environmental and health impacts. Restorative energy justice faces the challenge of deploying this restorative approach in an energy landscape that is often tightly focused on technology choices and business concerns.In Hawai‘i, we find an opportunity to operationalize the concept of restorative energy justice. The origin of Hawai‘i’s regulated electricity industry is indelibly intertwined with the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom. By incorporating a restorative approach that more fully considers the implications of those roots, energy regulators can better account for the future costs and benefits associated with Hawai‘i’s effort to decarbonize its electricity system. In turn, this improved accounting can reduce the risk that the urgency of decarbonization will be placed in a false tension with the imperative of justice.",Not About Sufficiency
Primary healthcare’s carbon footprint and sustainable strategies to mitigate its contribution: a scoping review,"BackgroundThe escalating climate crisis poses a significant threat to global public health. The healthcare sector, designed to protect human health is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and thus, a key driver of climate degradation. This paradox endangers both planetary and human health, making the decarbonization of healthcare, including primary care, critical. However, research on primary care’s contribution to emissions and strategies for mitigation remains limited.AimThis scoping review aimed to map how primary care contributes to healthcare’s environmental footprint and determine contributing factors. Additionally, it sought to identify existing and innovative strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of primary healthcare.MethodsA comprehensive strategy was developed to systematically search both published databases and grey literature. Key terms were identified and employed in the exploration of relevant databases and internet search engines.ResultsAn initial search yielded 246 published articles and 25 grey literature sources. 14 additional articles were included following forward and backward searching of prominent authors and key articles. After screening and full-text review, 39 articles and 12 reports/toolkits were included. The majority of sources were opinion pieces, with limited quantitative, observational, or qualitative studies.Primary care’s carbon footprint can be classified into clinical and non-clinical sources, with significant impacts from pharmaceuticals and inhaler propellant gases. Contributing factors include limited knowledge of emission sources, lack of awareness of sustainable practices, low prioritization of sustainability, barriers including ethical concerns and over-medicalization.Identified strategies to reduce emissions include decarbonization of patient care, increasing education and awareness, implementing non-clinical decarbonization efforts, and conducting more research to support sustainable initiatives. Developing metrics to track progress and securing policy supports to improve adoption and implementation were also highlighted as critical.ConclusionThe identification of sources of carbon hotspots in primary care is an essential precursor to enable the development of targeted decarbonization strategies. Decarbonizing primary care requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the underlying factors driving unsustainable practices. This would allow healthcare professionals to effectively balance the provision of high-quality patient care, while reducing their environmental impact, ultimately improving both human and planetary health.",Not About Sufficiency
"What do the sustainable development goals reveal, and are they sufficient for sustainable development?","The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 represent the current perceptions of humans regarding understanding and monitoring development. Achieving all 17 goals simultaneously is unrealistic. Considering the interconnected nature of SDGs, identifying their critical dimensions, goals, indicators, and mutual relationships is necessary. In addition, with increasing reservations about the sustainability of SDGs, it is crucial to explore consistency across different dimensions to ensure policy coherence in maximizing synergies and minimizing trade-offs. Our study employed multiple factor analysis (MFA) and hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC) to investigate these issues and analyze the results based on the public value (PV) theory. The results indicated that the Human Development Index (HDI) and gross domestic product per capita (GDPP) constitute the first principal component (PC) and are determinants in differentiating country clusters. However, they contradict environmental indicators such as CO2 emissions per capita and ecological footprint gha per person (EFP) and have low synergy with the Happy Planet Index (HPI). Additionally, the relationships between income level, inequality, and environmental quality correspond to a combined Kuznets curve and an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Moreover, governance capacity has become increasingly crucial in sustainable development, particularly in the capability to prioritize different PVs in a timely and strategic manner. Finally, despite the novelty of EFP and HPI, they cannot reveal the entire development story. SDGs require embracing more such indicators to enrich the value bases of development and achieve a sustainable future.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Economic Corridor and Tourism on Local Community's Quality of Life under One Belt One Road Context,"Economic corridors unlock new economic opportunities and tourism development in the region to achieve sustainable development goals. Green economic growth is conducive to environmental sustainability. Economic mega-projects of CPEC promote tourism that leads to communities’ well-being and better quality of life. Modern infrastructure development contributes significantly to economic growth and tourism activities. This study’s objectives emphasize exploring tourism and sustainable development pursuits under OBOR economic projects that open doors to improving residents' quality of life. The growing world is an eyewitness to a continuous rise in emissions and its severe consequences for humankind. It is necessary to show off the leading factors that result in tourism and economic activities causing environmental pollution rather than blame policymakers. Undoubtedly, many studies previously focused on demonstrating the influence of socio-economic factors that lead to better environmental quality. However, the empirical literature on tourism, social well-being, foreign direct investment, and the Environment in Belt and Road developed economies needed improvement. This research applied a series of advanced estimators that help demonstrate the study’s probable results. This study explores the role of Social well-being (HDI), tourism development, FDI, renewable energy, information & communication technology (ICT), and urbanization on CO2 emissions in Belt and Road (BRI) developed economies.Estimated results exhibited the significant contribution of ICT and renewable energy to sustainability. Besides, FDI contributes to emissions reduction after its threshold level. Conversely, urbanization and tourism activities contribute to environmental pollution. The study outcomes stated inverted/EKC U-shaped hypotheses related to specified economies. Finally, the analysis based on the D-H panel causality test constructs exciting results.The present study concludes that economic corridor plays a vital role in tourism development, the community’s well-being, and SDGs goals (sustainable development) impact on environmental safety. The findings suggest essential and applicable policies to attain the desired sustainability level. Findings contribute to the literature on tourism, well-being, and sustainability.

Synergizing social sustainability and technological innovation for carbon neutrality in OECD economies,"Economies around the globe are pushing toward a society's sustainability perspectives and upgradation in technology to protect the environment from global warming and the depletion of energy supplies. This shift in perception is primarily intended to alter people's attitudes toward posterity. By integrating the theories of interactions between social and ecological systems and the environment Kuznets curve (EKC) framework, this study explores the impact of nonrenewable energy consumption, social sustainability, and technological innovation on CO₂ emissions across the Organization for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD) countries from 2001 through 2020. Based on the estimates of FMOLS, PARDL, and QARDL, the 10‐year CO2 emissions and gross domestic product projections are traced using the average growth rate for each country and an average value of independent variables. The findings of this study highlight the detrimental effect of nonrenewable energy consumption on CO₂ emissions, underscoring the urgency for sustainable energy alternatives. However, the positive role of social sustainability and technological innovation in curbing CO₂ emissions within OECD countries is equally significant. Accentuating the importance of social sustainability within this context, the study sheds light on the integral role that societal factors, such as education, public awareness, and social well‐being, play a substantial role in shaping sustainable practices. It is found that Brazil, China, Malaysia, Russia, South Africa, and Thailand need to focus on higher economic growth to experience decarbonizing economic growth.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Energy Poverty Alleviation on Carbon Emissions in Countries along the Belt and Road Initiative,"Energy poverty and climate change are global challenges. While the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has fostered energy cooperation and alleviated energy poverty in BRI countries, its impact on climate change requires careful examination. This study investigates the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions in BRI countries and analyzes the underlying mechanisms. In particular, this study constructs an integrated energy poverty assessment framework that includes three dimensions of energy accessibility, cleanliness, and affordability and utilizes the entropy-TOPSIS method to assess the status of energy poverty in 70 BRI countries. Subsequently, an empirical analysis using the Gini index as an instrumental variable was conducted to explore the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions and the specific mechanisms. It is found that alleviating energy poverty in BRI countries will lead to an increase in per capita carbon emissions. However, improving energy cleanliness is effective in reducing per capita carbon emissions, while improving energy affordability has no significant impact on carbon emissions. This study shows that energy poverty alleviation and carbon emission reduction are two non-conflicting sustainable development goals. BRI countries can synergize energy poverty alleviation and carbon emissions reduction by focusing on clean energy development and providing energy subsidies.",Not About Sufficiency
"Carbon Budget Assessment and Influencing Factors for Forest Enterprises in the Key State-Owned Forest Area of the Greater Khingan Range, Northeast China","Analyzing the spatial and temporal changes in the carbon budget and its influencing factors is the basis for formulating effective measures to reduce emissions and increase sinks. This study establishes a carbon budget assessment model for forest enterprises, calculating forest carbon stocks and enterprise emissions using volume-derived biomass and emission factor methods. The spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of carbon budgets for forest enterprises in the key state-owned forest area (2017–2021) were analyzed using various methods, including the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and hotspot analysis. Influencing factors are identified through correlation analysis and the optimal parameter geographical detector (OPGD), while their spatial-temporal variations and causal relationships are analyzed using the geographical and temporal weighted regression model (GTWR) and structural equation modeling (SEM). The carbon budget in the Greater Khingan Range state-owned forest area averaged 10.16 × 106 t CO2-eq from 2017 to 2021, showing a gradual upward trend. The average annual carbon budget of forest enterprises was 1.02 × 106 t CO2-eq, which was highest in the central regions and lowest in the periphery. Soil pH, forest area, and elevation are the primary factors. The interaction between paired factors enhances the explanatory power of their impact, and the effects of different influencing factors exhibit both positive and negative variations across forest enterprises. In addition, the middle-aged forest tending area and average annual precipitation positively influenced forest area and soil pH, indirectly enhancing the carbon budget through multifactor interactions. This research can enhance the understanding of the carbon budget in forest enterprises, providing scientific support for the ecological protection of state-owned forests and contributing to the development of sustainable forestry practices that indirectly benefit societal well-being and economic resilience.",Not About Sufficiency
Waste incinerators undermine clean energy goals,"A national clean energy standard, modeled upon existing state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards, has been proposed to decarbonize the U.S. electric grid. Most such state policies include municipal solid waste incineration as a form of ""renewable"" energy, despite incinerators' prominent contributions to air pollution, primarily in environmental justice communities. This study finds that incinerators emit more greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity produced (1707 g CO2e/kWh) than any other power source (range: 2.4 to 991.1 g CO2e/kWh). They also emit more criteria air pollutants than replacement sources of energy, such as natural gas. Incineration's inclusion in ""renewable"" or ""clean"" energy standards is thus counterproductive, as they also divert more than $40 million in subsidies annually from cleaner energy sources. As the electric grid decarbonizes, these disparities will only grow. With most U.S. incinerators nearing their end of life, policy choices about their eligibility for subsidies may well decide whether they shut down or undertake expensive capital improvements to continue operating. Extending incinerators' operational lives by 20 years would result in excess emissions of up to 637.7 million tonnes CO2e, 61.9 million tonnes NOx, and 161,200 tonnes SO2. Conversely, a rapid shutdown of existing incinerators would help decarbonize the electric grid and reduce criteria air pollution, particularly in environmental justice communities, which are disproportionately burdened by environmental health hazards.",Not About Sufficiency

Optimization of Land Use Patterns in a Typical Coal Resource-Based City Based on the Ecosystem Service Relationships of ‘Food–Carbon–Recreation’,"Imbalanced supplies and demands of ecosystem services (ESSD) can negatively affect human well-being. Optimizing land use patterns in cities and regions is, in fact, essential to mitigate this challenge and ensure sustainable development. In this context, the present study aims to analyze the supply and demand of food production services (FPs), carbon sequestration services (CSs), and recreation services (RSs) in a typical coal resource-based city (Huainan) in China. In addition, the main influencing factors and their driving mechanisms were further explored using the geographical detector (Geo-Detector) and multi-scale geographic weighted regression (MGWR) models. Future land use changes were also predicted under traditional and constrained development scenarios using the GeoSOS-FLUS model. The obtained results indicated that: (1) the comprehensive ecosystem service (ES) supply index decreased from 1.42 to 0.84, while the comprehensive demand index increased from 0.74 to 0.95 during the 2010–2020 period; (2) the urban and rural areas had spatial disparities; (3) changes in the construction, ecological, and cultivated land strongly impacted ES; (4) implementing constrained development scenarios can effectively protect the ecological land, control urban expansion, and improve the ESSD relationships in Huainan City.

Where the power lies: Developing a political ecology framework for just energy transition,"This critical review lays down the fundamentals for rethinking just energy transition. It reviews the theoretical perspectives of energy justice, socio-technical transitions (STTs), and political ecology and presents a plausible and useful way to approach a just low-carbon transition using Political Ecology as a broad framework. This Political Ecology framework for Sustainable Energy Transition (PESET) addresses power issues associated with low-carbon transition, while also identifying the role of inclusivity and justice in low-carbon transition. As energy transition studies have primarily focused on the Global North and the extraction and production of large technologies, this framework provides a more radical means to achieve just transition objectives with particular relevance for application in the Global South-a region largely overlooked in transitions scholarship and where mundane/simple technologies (e.g. Solar Home Systems and clean cookstoves) typify transitions processes to date. The PESET framework presents a novel contribution, linking the concepts of energy justice, STTs, and political ecology to provide a more comprehensive means of framing and analysing just energy transitions. It thus provides a novel overarching framework linking energy studies, sustainability transitions, development studies and innovation studies especially in an era where the globe is moving toward a clean and affordable energy for all (Sustainable Development Goal 7).",Not About Sufficiency
Which countries are more ecologically efficient in improving human well-being? An application of the Index of Ecological Well-being Performance,"In today's world, improving the efficiency of transforming ecological consumption into human well-being is a necessary condition for humanity as a whole to achieve higher levels of well-being within ecological limits. In this paper, the Index of Ecological Well-being Performance (IEWP) is defined and constructed to measure the efficiency of transforming ecological consumption into human well-being and to determine which countries are more ecologically efficient in improving human well-being. As an efficiency measure, the main mission of the IEWP is to urge and stimulate countries to improve human well-being in an ecologically efficient way. The Human Development Index (measuring human well-being) and the Ecological Footprint (measuring ecological consumption) are employed to construct the IEWP. An empirical IEWP analysis of 82 countries with a population larger than 10 million in 2012 demonstrates that the developed countries (except Romania) and the G20 countries (except India and Indonesia) are generally less ecologically efficient in improving human well-being.

Who's fighting for justice?: advocacy in energy justice and just transition scholarship,"Recent political, economic and policy change in the US, Australia, and Europe, in particular, have put transitions towards low-carbon energy futures at the forefront of local and national policy agendas. How these transitions are managed is likely to affect the feasibility, timing and scope of transition policy. Recognizing the existing maldistribution of the benefits and burdens of fossil fuel-based extraction, energy generation, and distribution, advocates and scholars increasingly call for policies that not only support decarbonization goals, but also those of equity. Proposals that do not contain such goals may be met with resistance. This review examines the politics of achieving more just outcomes by asking, what is our current understanding of justice advocacy and the impacts of such advocacy on the energy transition? In this study, we systematically review articles that include the key concepts of 'just transition' or 'energy justice' and that examine advocacy in energy transition contexts. We find advocates from diverse communities and affiliated with varied organizational types are involved in advocacy. Diverse issues motivate advocates and the most common advocate type in the literature are residents that are affected by local impacts of energy transition decisions. Extra-institutional tactics are the most common means of advocate action. We also find that advocacy is often motivated by issues related to decision-making processes and environmental degradation. These findings illuminate that: (a) energy systems and transitions are governed by processes and institutions that are often inaccessible, (b) advocates often attempt to affect change using tactics external to such processes and institutions, and (c) issues of environmental degradation are often prominent in advocacy discourse concerning the energy transition. Future research should seek to more clearly determine advocates' primary motivations and the tactics and actions that ultimately aid or hinder more equitable outcomes.",Not About Sufficiency
Why policy coherence in the European Union matters for global sustainability,"The global economy is producing unequal economic exchanges between countries, including illegitimate transfer of wealth from low-income countries, which ultimately undermine efforts towards securing robust social welfare systems. This puts policies on trade and finance, corporate governance and circular economy at the centre of the global development puzzle. Policy coherence for development must be understood in the context of the tension between the overarching societal goal of achieving sustainability and the functioning of the global economy. In this article, we focus on the political and legal challenges this puzzle presents, using the case of European Union policies on business, finance and circular economy, which have global impacts. We see these as core areas of law and policy where advances are made but which need to be better positioned within an overarching aim of sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
"The Circular Economy of the Food Bank Supply Chain in Bandung City, West Java","Food banks play a crucial role in reducing food waste and addressing food vulnerability. Their operations involve an efficient supply chain that collects surplus food, processes it, and distributes it to those in need. This aligns with the goals of a circular economy, aiming to minimize food crises. This research aims to understand the supply chain of the Food Bank Bandung and analyze the implementation of circular economy principles within its supply chain. The study employs qualitative methods, with data gathered through interviews conducted with representatives from the Food Bank located in Bandung City. The collected information was used to design a comprehensive supply chain model, which was then meticulously analyzed. The analysis reveals that the Food Bank in Bandung effectively implements a circular economy by transforming surplus food, which would otherwise go to waste, into consumable items. Furthermore, the food bank adopts circular economy concepts by providing inedible food to Black Soldier Fly (BSF) cultivation for maggot consumption, which then can be used as an alternative source of protein for animal feed. The findings of the study show how circular economy practices can be integrated into food bank operations. By analyzing the circular economy approach in the Food Bank of Bandung, this research contributes to the existing body of knowledge and provides a foundation for future studies, offering a more extensive dataset for researchers and practitioners in the field.",Not About Sufficiency

"Will the circle be unbroken? The climate mitigation and sustainable development given by a circular economy of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and water","Closing the loop in the flow of C, nutrients and water between agriculture, the human diet and sanitation services offers benefits for humanity across multiple platforms of public health, food security and climate mitigation. This study assesses these benefits by describing the hypothetical scenario of a global, 'fully functional' circular economy, in which 100% of C, N and P were recovered from human excreta and returned to agricultural soil. Crop nutrient demand is calculated and compared with that which could be recovered, and greenhouse (GHG) emissions from fertilizer production, fertilizer application and sanitation services are presented, as are freshwater availability and crop irrigation requirements. These are considered to analyse the broader effects of this circular economy that is driven by dietary nutrition demand on climate change, the provision of sanitation services and crop irrigation, in 2022 and with projections to 2030 and 2050. We find the capacity of the circular economy to deliver crop nutrients and mitigate GHG emissions varies by region. Some regions benefit from supplementing conventional mineral fertilizers with excreta-derived fertilizers, others from reducing GHG emissions from sanitation services through improved resource recovery rates. A hypothetical, fully functional circular economy that recovers all excreta nutrient C, N and P would reduce global GHG emissions from N and P mineral fertilizer production and application by 140 Tg CO2 equivalents (CO2 e) per year in 2022 (similar to 12% of total emissions from mineral fertilizer production and application) and provide a maximum of 104 Tg C per year for sequestration in global cropland (similar to 12% of estimated annual soil C sequestration potential). A portion of this sequestered C will return to the atmosphere via soil respiration, however, with co-benefits to other soil functions such as crop nutrient fertility. The maximum potential reduction in GHG emissions from sanitation services through these measures would bring reductions of 445 Tg CO2 e per year in 2022, rising to 562 Tg CO2 e in 2050. Our results provide evidence to guide specific regional policy on reducing GHG emissions, offsetting mineral fertilizer use and optimizing municipal water use using the circular economy. Closing the loop in the flow of C, nutrients and water between agriculture, the human diet and sanitation services offers benefits for humanity across multiple platforms of public health, food security and climate mitigation.",Not About Sufficiency

Wind power! Marketing renewable energy on tribal lands and the struggle for just sustainability,"Using a case study approach and employing the critical framework of just sustainability, this article examines the ambivalent intersections of marketing and social/environmental justice as articulated through the public rhetoric of corporate entities that promote renewable energy generated on American Indian tribal lands. Because of its critical interest in the empowerment of disenfranchised communities through a shift away from traditional ways of valuing environmental sustainability and economic activity, just sustainability provides a valuable frame through which to interrogate not only articulations of economic development but also the use of popular American Indian archetypes like ""the Ecological Indian"" in the marketing of sustainable energy. We suggest that both our corporate case studies, NativeEnergy, which markets carbon offsets to clients, and the public utility company San Diego Gas and Electric, demonstrate efforts to advance many of the goals of just sustainability, and are successful in some respects, but fall short in others. We argue that shifts towards just sustainability in renewable energy projects on tribal lands, from management to the ways in which they are communicated to the public, will lead to more equitable economic, representational, and environmental conditions for participants.",Not About Sufficiency
Winning coalitions for just transitions: Insights from the environmental justice movement,"In recent years, attention within the sustainability transitions literature has focused on the politics of deliberately accelerating sustainability transitions. One core strand of this research has been to understand the role of coalition-building in supporting or undermining decarbonisation efforts. This scholarly work has clear synergies with the on-the-ground environmental justice movement, yet to date there has been limited exchange between this new literature and environmental justice movements. This perspective paper addresses this gap through examining three core areas of important and meaningful overlap between the environmental justice movement and the scholarly literature. These synergies centre around the praxis of building coalitions, understandings of power and appreciation of justice. In the context of climate breakdown, and the need to accelerate transitions to more just and sustainable futures, this perspective paper aims to lay the groundwork for more meaningful ex-change between the scholarly literature and on-the-ground environmental movement.",Not About Sufficiency
Public perception of transitioning to a low-carbon nation: a Malaysian scenario,"Efforts such as the Glasgow United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties 26, the Paris Agreement (Paris agreement, United Nations, Paris, 2015) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are supporting the drive to protect the planet from global warming by ensuring sustainable development. The oil and gas industry, as key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, must transition to more sustainable energy solutions and play their part in reducing these emissions. Currently, oil and gas companies are implementing technical solutions to achieve net zero carbon emissions. The energy transition from fossil fuel reliance has also happened by exploiting alternative renewable energy sources to meet global energy demand such as wind, solar, biogas and bioderived feedstocks. This net zero energy transition will require a fair and just transition for all in society, and to implement this, it is crucial for those working in the oil and gas industry to understand the technologies needed, the importance of carbon policies and their roles. This research presents a modified Delphi study of employees in Malaysia's national oil and gas company to understand their perceptions towards a net-zero carbon future. The paper briefly reviews Malaysia's low-carbon policy plans, its current carbon dioxide accounting balance, and identifies potential technologies for decarbonisation to set the scene for the modified Delphi study. The results indicated that the national oil and gas company has both the capabilities and the financial resources to significantly contribute towards Malaysia transitioning to a carbon neutral nation. This can be achieved by implementing advanced technologies complementing with nature-based solutions to realise net zero carbon emissions. This study also portrays the confidence that the portfolio of solutions should be executed through a coordinated effort to maximise the outcome and minimise the financial impact in terms of economical sustainability. Implementation of activities towards this energy transition will require significant social commitment, and hence, gauging their perception towards this journey is key objective of this paper.",Not About Sufficiency
A 1940-2020 spatiotemporal analysis of thermal discomfort days in Southeast Asian countries,"The high temperature and humidity make Southeast Asia (SEA) one of the regions most susceptible to the occurrence of thermal discomfort days (TDDs) in the world. In the context of global warming, SEA’s rapid population growth and urban expansion further exacerbated the region’s exposure to TDD, posing greater risks in public health. However, there exists a significant knowledge gap in the understanding of the long-term spatiotemporal evolution of TDD, as well as its projection in the future. By utilizing the newly released ERA5 datasets of Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) and Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT), this study presented the 81-year analysis of TDDs in SEA countries, spanning from 1940 to 2020, with projections extending to 2100. While the mean increase in UTCI was relatively modest, the corresponding rise in TDD likelihood was disproportionately larger, indicating a heightened risk of exposure. A distinct contrast was observed between continental and maritime regions, with maritime countries showing smaller absolute rises in both indices but larger trends in TDD frequency due to oceanic moderating effects. Seasonal analyses highlighted the dominant influence of the East Asia monsoon over SEA, and spatial analyses revealed a negative correlation between TDD occurrence and elevation, with low-lying areas being hotspots. Projections for 2050 suggest continued warming. These findings underscore the urgency of proactive measures to address climate change impacts, particularly in vulnerable maritime and low-lying areas, providing valuable insights for enhancing climate resilience and adaptation in SEA. Our findings reveal critical insights into the trends and future scenarios of thermal discomfort in the region, underscoring the urgent need for effective climate adaptation strategies.",Not About Sufficiency
Would an increasing block carbon tax be better? A comparative study within the Stackelberg Game framework,"Carbon tax is a policy for controlling carbon emissions, and is widely used worldwide. However, a non-differentiated carbon tax increases financial burden on manufacturers and inhibits their willingness to produce. Herein, a novel carbon tax policy involving an increasing block carbon tax is proposed, and the policy's possible implementation effects are analyzed. First, based on the Stackelberg game, the study constructs a social welfare model considering carbon emissions. Then, the study discusses the theoretical characteristics of the proposed carbon tax policy. After that, the differences and similarities between a flat carbon tax and an increasing block carbon tax are analyzed using a numerical simulation. The results indicate that: (1) compared to flat carbon tax, an increasing block carbon tax has the same controlling effect on carbon emissions. Both forms of taxes can restrict total carbon emissions within the desired range. (2) An increasing block carbon tax policy can significantly reduce tax burdens for manufacturers, and encourages low-carbon production. (3) An increasing block carbon tax can flexibly adjust the relationship between government's carbon tax revenue and manufacturer's tax burden. Finally, some policy implications for the proposed strategy are revealed.",Not About Sufficiency
Explore Associations between Subjective Well-Being and Eco-Logical Footprints with Fixed Effects Panel Regressions,"As environmental degradations constantly and directly threaten human well-being, it is imperative to explore the environmental impacts on people’s happy life. This research investigates the association between subjective well-being (SWB) and ecological footprints (EF) through space-time fixed effects panel regressions. EF, as a vital indicator of environmentally sustainable development, plays a vital role in ecological balance. SWB determines the subjective quality of life for humanity. EF-related factors and socio-economic indexes referring to GDP, urbanization rate, income, education, health, political stability, and political voice accountability in 101 countries were captured. Compared with ordinary least square (OLS), stepwise regression (SR) and fixed effects panel regression models (FEPR) exhibited good fitness regardless of the cross-section or longitudinal models due to R2 beyond 0.9. The finding also discloses that EF and health were positively significant to SWB, while income was negatively significant to SWB. EF was an invert u-shaped link to SWB, which met the assumption of EKC.

Spatio-temporal variations of the land-use-related carbon budget in Southeast China: the evidence of Fujian province,"The attainment of a regionally balanced carbon budget is fundamental for the realization of carbon neutrality. This study involved the quantification of the carbon budget related to land use across Southeast China from 2005 to 2020, which was achieved through the calculation of both carbon emissions and carbon sinks. Subsequently, we scrutinized the mechanisms driving the observed dynamic changes in the carbon budget, pinpointed the impact of land-use efficiency (LUE) on the carbon budget, and proposed sustainable spatial planning and management strategies for diverse functional areas at the county level. The core findings are as follows: The dynamics of the carbon budget were spatially heterogeneous, characterized by a gradual increase in carbon emissions over time, while carbon sinks remained relatively constant. The Gini coefficient (G) manifested a gradual increase throughout the study period, reflecting an imbalanced evolution between carbon sinks and emissions. There was also an observable imbalance in the distribution of the carbon ecological carrying coefficient between coastal and inland regions. Land-use-related carbon emissions demonstrated a substantial spatial spillover effect, whereas a weak spatial spillover effect was noted in land-use-related carbon sinks. The correlation between LUE and the carbon budget varied significantly across different functional areas, as the driving effects of LUE displayed remarkable spatial heterogeneity. A quantification of the spatio-temporal alterations and the driving mechanisms behind the carbon budget can aid in the advancement of urban sustainability and regional carbon neutrality.",Not About Sufficiency
The Impact of Carbon Taxes and Carbon Tax Recovery on the Chinese Economy: A Green Technological Progress Perspective,"Environmental challenges, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), pose significant threats to global sustainability. Sustainability requires achieving economic growth and social progress while minimizing environmental degradation, improving resource efficiency, and ensuring long-term ecological balance. At present, many studies have shown that carbon taxes may negatively impact the economy. However, environmental regulations also drive firms to pursue green technological innovations, thereby promoting progress. Previous studies on the regulatory measure of carbon taxes have often overlooked the potential influence of green technological progress on economic outcomes. To address these gaps, our research selected panel data from 30 provinces in China, spanning from 2005 to 2021, and employed the System Generalized Method of Moments (SYS-GMM) to evaluate the effect of carbon taxes on green total factor productivity (GTFP) and green total factor energy efficiency (GTFEE). The regression results, representing the green technological progress coefficient, are then incorporated into the China Energy-Environment-Economic Analysis 2.0 (CEEEA2.0) model. We also add carbon tax recovery to this model in order to analyze their economic impact from the new perspective of green technological progress. The SYS-GMM findings suggest that carbon taxes positively impact GTFP and GTFEE, with impact coefficients of 7.2% and 3.4%, respectively. The CEEEA2.0 model reveals that, without considering green technological progress, the introduction of carbon taxes negatively impacts the economy. However, this impact may turn into a positive one when green technological progress is considered. Additionally, carbon tax recovery measures help mitigate economic losses or enhance gains. Overall, this study offers a fresh perspective for modeling carbon tax implementation and holds both theoretical and practical significance and provides actionable insights into designing carbon tax policies that balance economic growth, social equity, and environmental sustainability.",Not About Sufficiency
Exploring Inequality: A Multi-Scale Analysis of China’s Consumption Carbon Footprint,"Carbon emission inequality has become a critical factor constraining the coordinated development of socio-economic systems and the natural environment. This inequality exacerbates the disparity in carbon emissions across regions, hindering efforts to achieve sustainable development and environmental justice. Previous research has primarily focused on the structure of carbon footprints and their influencing factors, but there has been limited quantitative research on carbon emission inequality, particularly from a multi-scale perspective. This study constructs a 250 m-high-resolution consumption-based carbon footprint grid for China and uses the Theil index to reveal significant spatial inequalities in carbon footprints. The results indicate that smaller-scale analyses better reveal the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of carbon footprints within regions. At the county level, carbon footprints exhibit significant inequalities, with hotspots concentrated in regions such as Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta. The top 5% of areas with the highest carbon footprints (139 cities) contributed 19.6% of the national total, indicating a concentration in a few large cities. The decomposition of the Theil index shows that county-level cities contributed 55% of the national carbon inequality. The study also reveals the complex relationship between carbon footprints and income, as well as urban-rural disparities. The underdeveloped central and western regions exhibit a pronounced spatial lag effect, with the growth rate of carbon footprints in rural areas surpassing that of urban areas. Carbon footprints in impoverished areas and inter-provincial marginal areas overlap significantly with low-emission zones, demonstrating characteristics of “low-carbon growth”. To achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets, China must adopt comprehensive measures to reduce carbon footprints and their inequalities, including strengthening multi-scale carbon inequality monitoring, implementing differentiated carbon reduction policies, and promoting coordinated emission reduction development at the county level.",Not About Sufficiency
"Global perspective of municipal solid waste and landfill leachate: generation, composition, eco-toxicity, and sustainable management strategies","Globally, more than 2 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) are generated each year, with that amount anticipated to reach around 3.5 billion tonnes by 2050. On a worldwide scale, food and green waste contribute the major proportion of MSW, which accounts for 44% of global waste, followed by recycling waste (38%), which includes plastic, glass, cardboard, and paper, and 18% of other materials. Population growth, urbanization, and industrial expansion are the principal drivers of the ever-increasing production of MSW across the world. Among the different practices employed for the management of waste, landfill disposal has been the most popular and easiest method across the world. Waste management practices differ significantly depending on the income level. In high-income nations, only 2% of waste is dumped, whereas in low-income nations, approximately 93% of waste is burned or dumped. However, the unscientific disposal of waste in landfills causes the generation of gases, heat, and leachate and results in a variety of ecotoxicological problems, including global warming, water pollution, fire hazards, and health effects that are hazardous to both the environment and public health. Therefore, sustainable management of MSW and landfill leachate is critical, necessitating the use of more advanced techniques to lessen waste production and maximize recycling to assure environmental sustainability. The present review provides an updated overview of the global perspective of municipal waste generation, composition, landfill heat and leachate formation, and ecotoxicological effects, and also discusses integrated-waste management approaches for the sustainable management of municipal waste and landfill leachate.",Not About Sufficiency
Integrating Circular Economy and Laudato Si’: A Christian Framework for Sustainable Development and Environmental Stewardship,"The circular economy and Laudato Si’ share a common vision for addressing environmental, ecological, and social challenges through sustainability, justice, and paradigm change.

Similarly, Laudato Si’ calls for integral ecology, recognizing the interconnectedness of environmental, social, economic, and cultural systems. Both emphasize practical actions, such as transitioning to renewable energy, promoting responsible waste management, and adopting regenerative agricultural practices to restore our ecosystems. Ethical consumption, simplicity, and moderation are central to both frameworks, encouraging shifts toward reuse, repair, and shared resources as common platforms to reduce overconsumption. Social justice remains a priority, with a focus on supporting marginalized populations unequally affected by ecological crises.

"A Simulation-Based Prediction of Land Use Change Impacts on Carbon Storage from a Regional Imbalance Perspective: A Case Study of Hunan Province, China","Land use imbalances are a critical driving factor contributing to regional disparities in carbon storage (CS). As a significant component of China’s Yangtze River Economic Belt, Hunan Province has undergone substantial shifts in land use types, resulting in an uneven distribution of ecosystem CS and sequestration capacity. Therefore, within the framework of the “dual carbon” strategy, examining the effects of land use changes driven by regional resource imbalances on CS holds practical importance for advancing regional sustainable development. This study focuses on Hunan Province, utilizing the PLUS-InVEST model to assess the spatiotemporal evolution of CS under land use changes from 1990 to 2020. Additionally, multiple scenario-based development modes were employed to predict county-level CS. The results indicate the following: (1) From 1990 to 2020, Hunan Province experienced continuous urban expansion, with forest land and cultivated land, which are core ecological land types, being converted into construction land. (2) Over these 30 years, the province’s total CS increased by 2.47 × 108 t, with significant spatial differentiation. High-value zones were concentrated in bands along the province’s borders, while lower values were observed in the central and northern regions. The highest CS values were recorded in forested areas at the province’s periphery, whereas the lowest values were observed in the northern water bodies. (3) The scenario-based predictions revealed notable differences, with the ecological protection scenario demonstrating a substantial carbon sink effect. By prioritizing forest and cultivated land, CS could be maximized. This research provides valuable insights for enhancing CS and optimizing land use structures in regions facing resource imbalances.",Not About Sufficiency

Land-use change, economic development and population made positive contributions, while energy efficiency and energy structure made negative contributions. At last, we put forward several suggestions for promoting low-carbon development, including development of a low-carbon and circular economy, rationally planning land-use structure, promoting reasonable population growth, improving energy efficiency and the energy consumption structure, and advocating low-carbon lifestyles. Our findings are useful in the tasks related to assessing carbon emissions from the perspective of land-use change and analyzing the associated influencing factors, as well as providing a reference for realizing low-carbon and sustainable development in the PRD.",Not About Sufficiency
Assessment and Optimization of Ecological Networks in Trans-Provincial Metropolitan Areas—A Case Study of the Xuzhou Metropolitan Area,"In the urbanization development trend, constructing inter-provincial metropolitan areas has gradually become an important pathway for China to implement its new urbanization strategy. Economic development in metropolitan areas inevitably leads to ecological degradation and fragmentation, threatening biodiversity. A reasonable assessment and optimization of the ecological network structure of inter-provincial metropolitan areas can effectively improve the stability of regional ecosystems and contribute to the sustainable development of urban and rural environments. In this study, we optimized the identification of ecological sources at the metropolitan area scale by constructing the ‘MIE’ model combined with the threshold analysis method, identified the core ecological sources in the Xuzhou Metropolitan Area, a typical cross-provincial metropolitan area in China, and then extracted the ecological corridors by using the Linkage Mapper tool based on this method. The spatiotemporal patterns and components of the ecological network of the Xuzhou metropolitan area from 1990 to 2020 were assessed, and an optimization analysis was performed based on the current ecological network. The results show that urban expansion has caused a decentralized layout of the ecological space in the study area across the provincial metropolitan area, with an uneven distribution of ecological sources and the development of ecological corridors in an east-dense and west-sparse pattern in 30 years. Increased interference by human activities has decreased the landscape dominance of the regional ecological resources and overall fragmentation of the habitats. The number of ecological corridors decreased, the average length of ecological corridors increased, the difficulty of biological flow increased, the connectivity of the ecological network structure decreased, and accessibility between source areas decreased. The α, β, and γ indices of the regional ecological network increased by 0.16, 0.46, and 0.1, respectively, after restoring important ecological sources and corridors. This study provides a framework for ecological network assessment and optimization in cross-provincial metropolitan areas, which is of great significance for studying metropolitan areas at similar stages of development.",Not About Sufficiency
Decarbonization will lead to more equitable air quality in California,"Air quality associated public health co-benefit may emerge from climate and energy policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the distribution of these co-benefits has not been carefully studied, despite the opportunity to tailor mitigation efforts so they achieve maximum benefits within socially and economically disadvantaged communities (DACs). Here, we quantify such health co-benefits from different long-term, low-carbon scenarios in California and their distribution in the context of social vulnerability. The magnitude and distribution of health benefits, including within impacted communities, is found to varies among scenarios which reduce economy wide GHG emissions by 80% in 2050 depending on the technology- and fuel-switching decisions in individual end-use sectors. The building electrification focused decarbonization strategy achieves ~15% greater total health benefits than the truck electrification focused strategy which uses renewable fuels to meet building demands. Conversely, the enhanced electrification of the truck sector is shown to benefit DACs more effectively. Such tradeoffs highlight the importance of considering environmental justice implications in the development of climate mitigation planning.Air quality is found to be more equitable through two salient decarbonization pathways for California in 2050 with the relative justice of decarbonization scenarios quantified at the neighborhood level and the tradeoffs between pathways evaluated.",Not About Sufficiency

Social Equity and Environmental Risk,"Social equity has become an important concern of the environmental movement over the past decade. The equity issue is analyzed here for practically all of the inactive hazardous waste disposal sites on the National Priorities List (NPL) regulated under the Comprehensive Response Compensation and Liability Act and its 1986 Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (CERCLA/ SARA). Two dimensions of equity are emphasized, namely, site location relative to the location of minority populations and the distribution of cleanup plans or Records of Decision (ROD) across communities with NPL sites that have different socioeconomic characteristics. With respect to site location, the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics aggregated at the Census Place or MCD level in communities with NPL sites was greater than is typical nationwide (largely attributable to the concentration of minority populations in a few large urban areas with NPL sites). In contrast, the percentage of the population below the poverty line in communities with NPL sites largely matched that of the nation as a whole. With respect to site cleanup, communities with relatively higher percentages of racial minority populations have fewer cleanup plans (Records of Decision signed) than other communities with NPL sites. Whether a ROD exists is influenced by when the site was designated for the NPL: sites designated earlier (prior to the SARA amendments of 1986) are more likely to have RODs, and also less likely to have high proportions of racial minority populations than sites designated later. This implies that initially the designation process may have resulted in NPL sites being located disproportionately in minority areas, but this pattern seems to be reversing itself in more recently designated sites. As with any statistical analysis, these findings are findings of association and not causality. Thus, racial and ethnic disproportionalities with respect to inactive hazardous waste site location seem to be concentrated in a relatively few areas. Disproportionalities with respect to cleanup do exist, but appear to be more a function of the nature of the process of designation of NPL sites in the early 1980s rather than a result of actions connected with cleanup plans per se. Further investigations are needed at alternative geographic scales to discern the sensitivity of patterns of inequity to distance from the sites. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

'Just Sustainability' or Just Sustainability? Shanghai's Failed Drive for Global Excellence,"A persistent challenge to deliver a socially just and ecologically sustainable development for emerging cities in non-Western countries is that legitimacy and effectiveness often hinge on the normalizing effect of international 'models' and 'standards' defined by the developed countries. In cases such as Shanghai's latest urban sustainability programme, a fixation on excelling at 'global indicators' has led its promises of inclusive social progress astray. We argue this is not simply because Shanghai authorities didn't 'get' just sustainability, but highlights a more rooted subaltern anxiety that constrains their perceptions on how their programmes should be identified and delivered. Drawing on Bourdieu's theorization of how social agency's 'logic of practice' is connected to their positions in the 'field', we investigate a shared epistemic deference among Shanghai experts and publics toward knowledge generated from international experiences. This has reproduced a marginalization of the subaltern public in the field of developing sustainable cities.",About Sufficiency
'Successful' low-carbon energy transitions at the community level? An energy justice perspective,"The aim of this paper is to critically analyse so-called 'successful' low-carbon energy transitions under the energy justice magnifying glass. We focus on two case studies that have been arguably referred to as successful local energy transitions in the literature: Samso (Denmark) and Feldheim (Germany). The study examines community perspectives and causal inferences about perceived energy (in)justice during the transition to a low-carbon local energy system. Theories of justice and process tracing form the core of our methodological approach. We identify and examine evidence in relation to four main areas: consultation processes, information flow/sharing, decision making and outcomes. The findings reveal that the transition processes were triggered by a multi-dimensional crisis in a unique context, and highlight the role of procedural justice in the investigated areas. Multiple tensions and conflicts were identified (notably concerning the location and ownership of wind turbines). However, and strongly driven by local, bottom-up, intensive information and consultation processes, evidence of perceived procedural Justice was found in both cases. With regard to distributive justice, communities perceived the outcomes of the transition as beneficial to some groups, particularly from the point of view of benefits for individuals. Perceived energy justice was more positive if social and environmental outcomes were considered, including the implementation of compensation schemes. However, a quantitative analysis is required to qualify these assertions. With due limitations, we conclude that the perceived fairness of procedures, as identified in both cases, seemed to be a critical pre-condition for the perceived legitimacy of outcomes.",About Sufficiency
Why GOD? The Benefits of Greenspace-Oriented Development,"In this chapter, we set out a strategy for urban densification, which we name Greenspace-Oriented Development (GOD). While Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) co-locates urban densification with public transport hubs, GOD colocates urban densification with significant, upgraded public green spaces (such as parks) that are relatively well served by public transport. The upgraded parks, and their connecting streetscapes, operate as a multifunctional, communal ""backyard"" for residents living in a surrounding higher-density urban precinct. Through GOD, we propose to weave together the positive aspects of suburbia (i.e. access to open space and nature) with those of good quality medium-density urban infill (i.e. access to public transport, facilities and good urban design). In this chapter, we describe GOD, its key principles, benefits and the settings to which it is most suited.",About Sufficiency
Studying the impact of carbon tax and emission trading system on electricity market,"To achieve the goal of stabilizing carbon dioxide at acceptable levels under the Paris agreement, it is essential to control carbon emissions by implementing regulatory interventions. Carbon tax and emission trading system (ETS) are two effective tools to regulate carbon emissions. Various studies have investigated both methods, yet few have considered the impact of these two policies on the electricity market and social welfare. The purpose of this paper is to fill in the gap, namely to quantify the influence of the carbon tax and ETS using the baseline-and-credit method on the electricity market. In addition, an optimal hybrid policy that combines both carbon tax and ETS is developed. Our case studies demonstrate that carbon tax, ETS, and the hybrid carbon policy can achieve the goal of reducing carbon emission and increasing social welfare. For hybrid policy, the carbon tax rate and the emission marginal cost of allowance in ETS are optimized properly to maximize social welfare.",About Sufficiency
Analysis of Energy Justice and Equity Impacts from Replacing Peaker Plants with Energy Storage,"Transitions to low-carbon energy systems are essential to mitigating and adapting to climate change. Energy storage systems are a key component in achieving a viable decarbonized electric grid. However, decarbonization alone does not guarantee a fairer, more inclusive, or socially just energy system. Energy equity and justice should be integrated in energy system transitions to ensure benefits and burdens are shared equitably. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between energy storage and social equity by assessing the use of energy storage to replace natural gas-fired (NG) peaker plants. Peaker plants are disproportionately located near disadvantaged communities and tend to be older and high emitters of health-affecting fine particulate matter and other pollutants. This paper investigates the equity implications of NG peaker plant replacements with battery energy storage in the context of Washington State's peaker plants to highlight the human-centered values of retiring the plants. The study performed production cost simulations using the latest Western Electric Coordinating Council Anchor Dataset 2030 case and found that total generation cost, locational marginal price, and total annual emissions were reduced with the replacements. These reductions will have equity benefits on local communities including access to clean air, enhanced health outcomes, and energy burden reductions.",About Sufficiency
PRIORITIZATION OF NEW GREEN INFRASTRUCTURES AIMED AT PROTECTING URBAN BIODIVERSITY,"Urban expansion threatens ecosystems, biodiversity, and public health. Green infrastructure helps promote biodiversity and improve air and water quality, and public health benefits. This study aimed to develop a geospatial model to support decision-making on identifying priority areas for increasing green infrastructure to maintain biodiversity in urban landscapes, focusing on the Atlantic Forest Biome. The model was based on Multicriteria Analysis and a mixed approach to define the criteria, integrating literature review and participatory techniques. Using the Weighted Linear Combination, the model classified areas into low, medium, and high priorities based on four criteria: landscape connectivity, proximity to Protected Areas, rivers and lakes, and distances from streets and roads. The high-priority areas were identified as the most suitable for implementing new green infrastructure. Results provide insights for urban managers seeking to expand green networks and biodiversity-driven infrastructure, transforming urban areas into resilient ecosystems addressing the challenges posed by climate change.",About Sufficiency
"8Rs for circular water and sanitation systems: Leveraging circular economy thinking for safe, resilient and inclusive services","To achieve their normative health, environmental and social objectives, water and sanitation services must be safely managed, inclusive and climate resilient. Meeting these imperatives presents a need and opportunity for innovative thinking about water and sanitation service systems. Circular economy concepts are being applied across a multitude of product and service sectors with the aim to facilitate regenerative flows of resources. Given the dependence on water resources, associated climate risks, and the generation of reusable waste products in water and sanitation service delivery, circular economy concepts can be usefully leveraged to drive sustainability outcomes. This article contributes a heuristic in the form of a conceptual framework for applying circular economy concepts in the design and delivery of water and sanitation services in diverse Global South contexts. The framework seeks to drive multiple outcomes relevant to water and sanitation initiatives: safely managed services, social inclusion, and climate resilience. Co-developed by an international research team applying a theoretical multiplicity approach and collaborative sensemaking, the heuristic takes the form of a suite of eight adapted circular economy 'R strategies' for water and sanitation. The R strategies were selected and articulated to reflect theory-based principles of circular economy, climate resilience and inclusion. They are intended to prompt thinking and action in pursuit of safely managed, climate resilient, inclusive water and sanitation services that align with the broader sustainability directions that circular economy narratives aspire to. The heuristic offers a conceptually rigorous, practical tool that can support collaborative, deliberative processes to realise the potential benefits of circularity in water and sanitation service systems.",About Sufficiency

"A 5D LAND-USE TRANSPORT MODEL FOR A HIGH DENSITY, RAPIDLY GROWING CITY","Purpose - The objective of this chapter is to draw the attention of policy makers in the fields of urban planning and transport in China to the importance of developing more balanced multi-modal transport systems and the corresponding land-use patterns to support transport systems, particularly walking and cycling in order to address the issues arising from the dense, highly mixed land-use pattern in many Chinese cities. This will help to reverse current planning practices which give car-oriented development top priority and less consideration of walking and cycling. Methodology - Statistical methods have been applied to analyse modal split in some cities in Japan, Beijing and Shanghai using travel surveys, plus analysis of the experience of policies in various cities around the world, especially in terms of the relationship between the modal shares for public transport and car. Door-to-door travel times have been analysed for Shanghai to understand the potential of cycle or e-bicycle in a dense urban environment. Findings - The change in travel modal split in Beijing in recent years suggests that simply encouraging public transport cannot control use of car. The data from Japan also shows that normal bus services cannot compete with the car, but it is clear that people will travel less by car if there is a high non-motorized share in the city. Because of the low density of the metro network, the door-to-door travel speed by metro is not as fast as is often imagined, due to the long off-metro time. The people who use metro are often not the people who live very close to metro stations, but some distance away, so improving the connection to the station by cycle or e-bicycle could greatly reduce the total travel time by metro. Research limitations and implications - More analyses should be conducted in medium-size and small-size cities in China, where the local capacity is low and there is great potential to travel by walking and cycling, but only after clear guidance and policy instruments have been provided by higher authorities. Practical and social implications - There is still a relatively high share of non-motorized travel in China. Many cities still have extensive cycle infrastructure established under the State Code of Urban Road Transport Planning issued in 1995. Encouraging non-motorized transport systems is not only possible, but also good for the environment, and contributes to travel efficiency and social inclusion. Originality - This chapter is the summary of several original research studies using primary survey data, encouraging public transport in China. This is the first research to show the great potential of non-motorized mode for controlling car use and improving urban mobility in China. It is also the first chapter to point out the integration of multi-modal transport systems with the corresponding built environment in China.",About Sufficiency
A Future-Proof Built Environment through Regenerative and Circular Lenses-Delphi Approach for Criteria Selection,"Despite the increasing use of neighbourhood sustainability assessment tools (NSAT), their linear approach may be insufficient to tackle the global and local social and ecological challenges. The circular economy (CE) has recently emerged as a new pathway, adopted by corporations and public organisations. Understanding how to apply CE to existing communities, while addressing some of its shortcomings, particularly the strong focus on resource management, is the main goal of this paper. Building upon a Regenerative Circularity for the Built Environment (RC4BE) conceptual model that merges circular economy and regenerative design concepts, a framework with criteria for its implementation in the transition of existing urban areas is proposed. A preliminary framework structure with criteria mapped from literature is proposed and validated through a 2-round Delphi consultation with 31 international experts. The final framework, with 136 criteria, addresses some of the identified gaps and different urban cycles related to physical resources, ecosystems, liveability, infrastructure, governance, participation, local economy, and other socioeconomic aspects of urban communities.

A game theory analysis of green infrastructure stormwater management policies,"Green stormwater infrastructure has been demonstrated as an innovative water resources management approach that addresses multiple challenges facing urban environments. However, there is little consensus on what policy strategies can be used to best incentivize green infrastructure adoption by private landowners. Game theory, an analysis framework that has historically been under-utilized within the context of stormwater management, is uniquely suited to address this policy question. We used a cooperative game theory framework to investigate the potential impacts of different policy strategies used to incentivize green infrastructure installation. The results indicate that municipal regulation leads to the greatest reduction in pollutant loading. However, the choice of the ""best"" regulatory approach will depend on a variety of different factors including politics and financial considerations. Large, downstream agents have a disproportionate share of bargaining power. Results also reveal that policy impacts are highly dependent on agents' spatial position within the stormwater network, leading to important questions of social equity and environmental justice.",About Sufficiency
A narrative for circular economy in Cities: Conditions for a Mission-Oriented innovative system,"In response to the adverse consequences of urbanisation, including the production of over 70% of global emissions and the increase in social inequalities, cities have set ambitious missions to devise a set of innovative solutions in their transition to a circular economy. This exploratory research examines the conditions that should be met for such missions to trigger the development of an innovative system that could support cities in such a transition. While several studies have been conducted on the narrative of the circular economy as a 'way of doing', this article adopts the circular economy as a 'way of thinking'. To further explore the conceptual diversity of the circular economy, this article uses rapid ethnography as a method in the context of a Dutch region by pursuing a circular mission. The results highlight that a mission alone is not enough to create an innovative and inclusive system as the underlying narrative lacks congruence; this, thus, suggests that the circular economy may not be the most compelling narrative for the mission of cities toward a more sustainable development.",About Sufficiency

A review of distributed energy system optimization for building decarbonization,"Building energy consumption has increased rapidly in the past decade, in particular for heat demand and electric vehicles, owning to the development of economy and improvement of living standard. Distributed Energy Systems (DESs), which can effectively improve the share of renewable energy in the energy mix, lower the energy cost and reduce environmental impact, is a promising approach to meet the increased energy demand. This paper presents a review of the system architecture of DESs for building decarbonization, including hybrid energy systems, en-ergy storage technologies, building flexible loads, and electric vehicles. The uncertainties from both the environment and human interventions challenge the energy management due to the asynchrony between energy generation and energy consumption. Thus, the system should be optimally designed and operated to enhance the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of the DES. The paper highlights the adoption of optimization approaches. Finally, future trends and challenges are discussed. It is concluded that the digital transformation featured with IoT, AI, advanced machine learning, sophisticated optimization approaches, and Blockchain is the enabler for future smart cities.",About Sufficiency
A sustainability index with attention to environmental justice for eco-city classification and assessment,"Sustainability programs and their assessments have often been criticized for failing to support social justice. Eco-city development has also raised similar concerns. This research was conducted in order to address such problems. Specifically, this paper develops a new sustainability index that emphasizes environmental justice for the purpose of better classifying and assessing eco-cities. The proposed index measures equity among places as a result of eco-city development. Specifically, this index indicates instances in which a certain location achieves sustainability through means detrimental to another location. Thus, the index, comprised of environmental, economic, and social indicators of sustainability, may also be used to foster justice among diverse locations (urban centers, suburbs, rural areas, and neighboring cities) by highlighting the genuine motives behind eco-city development. One preliminary finding from the application of this classification is that oftentimes, eco-city development is not completed in the environmental, economic, or social interests of the people. Official eco-cities tend to serve government officials' interest in upper mobility. Developer eco-cities tend to be commercial expansions or developments focused on growth, profit, and model demonstration. Both official and developer eco-cities degrade the environment. They are also likely to develop urban centers at the environmental expense of other places. The economic growth of official and developer eco-cities is accompanied by worsening income inequality and social injustice. As a result, these types of eco-cities fail the sustainability performance assessment. Conversely, eco-cities founded by the citizens or by donors tend to focus on social and economic equity. This study was completed using qualitative research methods, including field work in 29 eco-cities throughout China and various countries. This field work was conducted from 2006 to 2014. Data was collected through interviews with 87 government officials, as well as environmental experts, grassroots environmentalists, residents, and real estate developers. The findings reveal that the majority of Chinese eco-cities have been overlooked in global eco-city literature. The research also calls for effective sustainability management in order to avoid the development of eco-cities that negatively impact the environmental and social interests of surrounding areas.",About Sufficiency

Thus, we provided a comprehensive overview of CS in Urban Studies and Regional Urban Planning (USRUP) by revealing the main thematic/method approaches, stakeholder roles, socioeconomic/environmental/policy impacts, limitations, best practices, and cases. Thus, we performed a Systematic Literature Review on CS in USRUP using the PRISMA Guidelines of 94 studies collected from the Web of Science Core Collection, published by 2023. Our key findings underscore the practical uses of diverse methodologies and approaches employed in CS projects, emphasizing their potential to enhance urban research and policymaking. The core socioeconomic impacts of CS projects are fostering community empowerment, engagement, and educational opportunities. The main environmental impacts are enhancing monitoring capabilities, improving ecosystem service assessments, and supporting adaptive management practices. As for urban planning and policies, CS projects can foster data-driven planning, urban sustainability, urban resilience, healthier cities, and social equity. CS challenges include data quality and consistency, the digital divide, and the need for sustained funding. Best practices have included clear communication, standardized protocols, and strong community engagement.

"A Systematic Review of the Role of Land Use, Transport, and Energy-Environment Integration in Shaping Sustainable Cities","Land use, transport, and energy-environment integration (LUTEI) is receiving considerable attention as an elaborate approach to improving urban resilience. Research evidence on this multidisciplinary topic tends to be fragmented, hindering constructive analysis of its role in shaping sustainable cities. This paper addresses this by undertaking a holistic systematic review to consolidate diverse perspectives. The analysis of 195 reviewed papers identified four main clusters of knowledge that include methodological approaches, policy instruments, urban design elements, and impacts of interventions. The analysis revealed that a growing body of literature is increasingly focused on improving accessibility planning, transit-oriented development, and policy integration to achieve sustainable and healthy transport as a vital element of resilience in cities. The review found, however, that the integration of environment and energy into land use and transport models is still at a nascent stage of development and has largely been overlooked in traditional LUTI models. This can lead to unreliable assessments of the impacts of low-carbon mobility solutions, emerging green transport technologies, and long-term changes in energy consumption affecting sustainable mobility futures. This paper concludes by connecting LUTEI dimensions to the UN's sustainable development goals (SDG), outlining future directions to ignite meaningful research on the topic and providing a transparent path for decision-makers to adopt LUTEI-informed planning.",About Sufficiency
"Abandonment, Ecological Assembly and Public Health Risks in Counter-Urbanizing Cities","Urban landscapes can be transformed by widespread abandonment from population and economic decline. Ecological assembly, sometimes referred to as greening, following abandonment can yield valuable ecosystem services, but also can pose a risk to public health. Abandonment can elevate zoonotic vector-borne disease risk by favoring the hyperabundance of commensal pests and pathogen vectors. Though greater biodiversity in abandoned areas can potentially dilute vector-borne pathogen transmission, greening can elevate transmission risk by increasing movement of pathogen vectors between fragmented areas and by giving rise to novel human-wildlife interfaces. Idled and derelict infrastructure can further elevate disease risk from vector-borne and water-borne pathogens, which can build up in stagnant and unprotected water that maintenance and routine use of delivery or sanitation systems would otherwise eliminate. Thus, framing greening as inherently positive could result in policies and actions that unintentionally exacerbate inequalities by elevating risks rather than delivering benefits. As counter-urbanism is neither a minor pattern of urban development, nor a short-term departure from urban growth, homeowner and municipal management of abandoned areas should account for potential hazards to reduce health risks. Further socioecological assessments of public health risks following abandonment could better ensure the resilience and well-being of communities in shrinking cities.",About Sufficiency

By focusing on multifunctionality, these solutions address multiple issues simultaneously, such as improving insulation, enhancing urban biodiversity, managing stormwater, and reducing the urban heat island effect. The research investigates the potential of NBS to facilitate sustainable neighborhood development, emphasizing economic strategies through closed-loop systems to rehabilitate damaged ecosystems, enhance biodiversity, and revitalize neglected and underutilized spaces that detract from a city's overall quality of life. A comprehensive review of existing literature has been undertaken to clarify the scalability potential of NBS within the housing sector, leading to more resilient, equitable, and livable urban environments. This research emphasizes innovative maintenance strategies to ensure the sustainability of NBS across various urban and socio-economic contexts. The review compiles recommendations for conceptualizing NBS for resilient neighborhoods while identifying an execution framework for NBS implementation in neighborhoods particularly those with low-income housing, by engaging communities to promote a sense of belonging and socio-economic resilience.",About Sufficiency
Adaptive society in a changing environment: Insight into the social resilience of a rural region of Taiwan,"Taiwan has abundant biological resources that provide a quality living environment; however, industrial land use may change that environment through urban sprawl and thus have impacts on rural society. This study examined the experience of a Taiwanese rural region that has been exposed to industrial wastewater discharge specifying the relationship of industrial development to rural society and its role in policy. We addressed the societal adaptation to environmental degradation from risk perception perspectives about land use. Drawing on social vulnerability concept, semi-structured interviews were conducted in five communities that use irrigation water exposed to wastewater discharge. The interviews were designed using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) causal framework to examine residents' risk perceptions highlighting both built-environmental sensitivity (degradation) and residents' adaptability (capacity). In addition, remote sensing technology was used to identify the urban sprawl that led to industrial land use and exposed the rural region to water pollution risks. As a result, we present a social resilience cycle to introduce adaptive responses underlining social amplification of risk. Both local knowledge of the locals (the Hakka people) and their societal response to environmental change reflect the role of culture in influencing land use policy. It is underlined that individual and community responses shape the social experience of risk and are related to both the ethnicity of the locals and the land use policy of the government. We indicated further that a large-scale survey that would really quantity this exploratory study to support land use decision-making is expected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Agricultural land use in Vietnam in the context of urbanization: status and policy implications,"This article generalizes the urbanization process and its impact on agricultural land use in Vietnam. The high rate of urbanization has led to a great demand for purchasing agricultural products, especially high-quality ones, and as a result, this affects agricultural development. On one hand, it offers new chances to expand the domestic market and to encourage exports. On the other hand, the conversion of agricultural land into non-agricultural land under accelerated urbanization leads to a large area of arable land being abandoned or polluted, consequently affecting food security and sustainable development. Therefore, to meet the people's food needs in the context of urbanization, it is necessary to have proper solutions to improve the efficiency of agricultural land use, such as: implementing land laws aimed at developing agricultural production in the direction of large-scale, concentrated commodities; executing land-use planning, performing agricultural production planning towards specialized cultivation with a stable term to ensure profitable investment; boosting the restructuring of the agricultural sector; developing collective and cooperative economics in agriculture; having policies to support, forecast, and search for markets for consumption and the processing of agricultural products; creating a transparent land-use rights market.",About Sufficiency
A Need for Sufficiency in the Built Environment: Prospective Life Cycle Assessment of the Austrian Building Stock,"Around 38% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are related to buildings. In Austria, most building-related industries designed roadmaps to net zero GHG emissions by 2050. However, there is little evidence whether this will be enough to stay within the climate limits, or if a more drastic approach is needed. In this paper we investigate the potential need for sufficiency in the built environment to stay within the latest 1.5-2°C carbon budget, including expected future technological developments. We implement a set of energy and industry transition scenarios to a building stock model, including an increase in circularity, and compare the resulting carbon emissions (both operational and embodied) with the carbon budget. Results show that, even with ambitious decarbonization pathways for Austrian industry, the projected rates of construction do not allow for staying within the carbon budget. On the contrary, additional sufficiency measures such as slightly reducing the average living area per person are a great lever for reducing GHG emissions and, with carbon removal, might be the only options left to comply with the climate targets.",About Sufficiency
Urban patterns and environmental performance: What do we know?,"This paper reviews the empirical evidence on the relationships between urban patterns and various dimensions of environmental quality and performance. I first examine approaches to measuring urban environmental performance, drawing on the concepts of carrying capacity, ecological footprint, environmental space, and appropriated ecosystem area. Since cities affect and are affected by ecological systems far beyond their physical boundaries, I propose including interactions at the local, regional, and global scales in the definition of environmental performance. I then systematically review the current literature on the relationship between four structural variables typically used to describe urban patterns-form, density, grain, and connectivity-and four dimensions of environmental performance-sources, sinks, ecological support systems, and human well-being. I conclude that what we measure and the scale of analysis affect the direction of observable urban impacts. We must consider these factors as we select measures of urban environmental performance.",About Sufficiency
The city race to carbon neutrality; a realistic dream or a chimera?,"This paper examines whether carbon neutrality of a city like Athens could be an achievable target, concentrating on energy induced greenhouse gas emissions. The main focus is on buildings, but the trends in transport are also investigated. Taking into consideration these examined trends, emphasis is given on technologies that have been put forward for the decarbonisation of cities, such as energy savings and electrification of all energy consuming activities. The incorporation of these technologies is examined within a time frame of approximately 30 years, in order to investigate how, with which technologies and synergies the city can reach carbon neutrality by 2050, taking into account the effect of the undergoing energy crisis. In these projections, various scenarios are examined, taking into consideration not only the effect of national plans for the decarbonisation of electricity production, but also the current energy crisis, which might lead to an increase in the carbon footprint of electricity. Optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, regarding the decarbonisation of electricity, energy demand trends, energy costs that lead to the rise of energy poverty within the city are investigated. Conclusions are drawn on the synergies that must take place so that energy efficiency technologies that have been put forward can be effective for the transformation of Athenian buildings and activities into carbon neutral ones, or can lead to the failure of such a goal.",About Sufficiency
"Aligning practices towards a circular economy in the architecture, engineering, and construction sector: seven transitions in different stages of reconfiguration","The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector is in need of a transition towards a circular economy.

"A Systematic Review of the Role of Land Use, Transport, and Energy-Environment Integration in Shaping Sustainable Cities","Land use, transport, and energy-environment integration (LUTEI) is receiving considerable attention as an elaborate approach to improving urban resilience. Research evidence on this multidisciplinary topic tends to be fragmented, hindering constructive analysis of its role in shaping sustainable cities. This paper addresses this by undertaking a holistic systematic review to consolidate diverse perspectives. The analysis of 195 reviewed papers identified four main clusters of knowledge that include methodological approaches, policy instruments, urban design elements, and impacts of interventions. The analysis revealed that a growing body of literature is increasingly focused on improving accessibility planning, transit-oriented development, and policy integration to achieve sustainable and healthy transport as a vital element of resilience in cities. The review found, however, that the integration of environment and energy into land use and transport models is still at a nascent stage of development and has largely been overlooked in traditional LUTI models. This can lead to unreliable assessments of the impacts of low-carbon mobility solutions, emerging green transport technologies, and long-term changes in energy consumption affecting sustainable mobility futures. This paper concludes by connecting LUTEI dimensions to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDG), outlining future directions to ignite meaningful research on the topic and providing a transparent path for decision-makers to adopt LUTEI-informed planning.",About Sufficiency
Alleviation of energy poverty through transitions to low-carbon energy infrastructure,"With Green Deals and a competitive techno-economic basis for low-carbon energy transitions, energy infra -structural change is intensifying. This is matched by rapid growth in scholarship on sociotechnical transitions and energy justice, combined in the phrase 'just transitions'. Yet how can an abstract concern with a normative concept like justice be brought to bear on the socio-technical complexities of specific changes in energy infra-structure? This is an important and timely question to consider in a practical sense, since the energy policy landscape is increasingly focused on a 'just transition' as combining decarbonisation and a progressive vision of social equity and justice. Our synthesis review argues that a focus on the alleviation of energy poverty - a condition whereby people are unable to secure adequate levels of energy services in the home - can enable policy-oriented mobilisation of energy justice as an integral component of evolving energy infrastructure. We approach energy poverty as an opportunity to constructively broach issues of justice in global energy policy discourse, not as a catch-all for wider injustices and vulnerabilities. We present a conceptual framework, applied to three schematic cases of energy infrastructure under transition. In and across these cross-sectoral cases, we reflect on scope for energy poverty alleviation.",About Sufficiency
Allocation equity of regulating ecosystem services from blue-green infrastructures: A case study of street blocks in Wuhan central city,"Rapid urban expansion has aggravated the degradation of ecosystem services (ES). The ES provided by blue -green infrastructure (BGI) is a critical factor influencing the urban environmental quality, and its allocation is closely associated with the life quality and equal rights of urban residents. Here, considering the major envi-ronmental problems in the urbanization process of Wuhan, nine components of ES related to four different types of BGI were selected for study. First, we quantified and mapped the provision of ES by various types of BGI based on a quantitative table obtained by reviewing the current literature on ES. Then, we illustrated the relationship between BGI and regulating ES (illustrated the characteristic of the ES provided by BGI) from the perspective of contribution rate and efficiency, and analyzed the allocation equity of regulating ES with some sociological methods. Based on the Gini index, our results showed that the allocation of regulating ES based on population is highly inequitable (0.70), while that based on space is relatively equitable (0.15) in Wuhan at the whole city scale. The Gini index was calculated for the nine ES components, including SO2 absorption, dust retention, runoff mitigation, precipitation infiltration, cooling, humidifying, noise absorption, carbon fixation and oxygen release. The results reveal that there are slight differences among different ES components. Although the mean value of PAL (population-average allocation level; 3.08) is higher than that of SAL (spatial-average allocation level; 0.72) in Wuhan, PAL has a much higher standard deviation than SAL, indicating the existence of significant gaps in PAL of ES among different blocks. Based on the integration of PAL and SAL, the blocks with relatively sufficient SAL and PAL of regulating ES were found to be mainly located in the northeast of the city, while those with very insufficient SAL and PAL of regulating ES are highly urbanized areas. Besides, the block with very insufficient SAL of regulating ES is located in urban industrial areas close to the suburbs, while those with insufficient PAL of regulating ES are scattered in the area close to the suburbs, respectively. Then, we proposed three priority levels and a judgment model for appropriate interventions based on allocation inequity in urban blocks. Our findings provide important implications for urban planning by associating ES with resident welfare.",About Sufficiency
Evaluating Ecosystem Service Trade-Offs and Recovery Dynamics in Response to Urban Expansion: Implications for Sustainable Management Strategies,"Land use land cover (LULC) changes due to rapid urbanization pose critical challenges to sustainable development, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions like Saudi Arabia, where cities such as Abha are experiencing unprecedented expansion. Urban sprawl is accelerating environmental degradation, affecting key natural resources such as vegetation, water bodies, and barren land. This study introduces an advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based framework for high-accuracy LULC classification, urban sprawl quantification, and ecosystem service assessment, providing a more precise and scalable approach compared to traditional remote sensing techniques. A hybrid methodology combining ML models—Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Machine, and LightGBM—with a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was fine-tuned using grid search optimization to enhance classification accuracy. The integration of deep learning improves feature extraction and classification consistency, achieving an AUC of 0.93 for Dense Vegetation and 0.82 for Cropland, outperforming conventional classification methods. The study also applies the Markov transition model to project land cover changes, offering a probabilistic understanding of urban expansion trends and ecosystem dynamics, providing a significant improvement over static LULC assessments by quantifying transition probabilities and predicting future land cover transformations. The results reveal that urban areas in Abha expanded by 120.74 km2 between 2014 and 2023, with barren land decreasing by 557.09 km2 and cropland increasing by 205.14 km2. The peak ecosystem service value (ESV) loss was recorded at USD 125,662.7 between 2017 and 2020, but subsequent land management efforts improved ESV to USD 96,769.5 by 2023. The resilience and recovery of natural land cover types, particularly barren land (44,163 km2 recovered by 2023), indicate the potential for targeted restoration strategies. This study advances urban sustainability research by integrating state-of-the-art deep learning models with Markov-based land change predictions, enhancing the accuracy and predictive capability of LULC assessments. The findings highlight the need for proactive land management policies to mitigate the adverse effects of urban sprawl and promote sustainable ecosystem service recovery. The methodological advancements presented in this study provide a scalable and adaptable framework for future urbanization impact assessments, particularly in rapidly developing regions.",About Sufficiency
An Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Urbanization Patterns in Northwest China,"Chinese metropolitan areas have been experiencing urbanization over the past decades, impacting biodiversity, carbon emissions, urban heat islands, and food security. Yet, systematic research on spatio-temporal urbanization patterns and drivers along the urban-rural gradient is rarely reported for northwest China. Here, we use land-use data from 1980 to 2015 to explore land-use change, urbanization intensity, and drivers in northwest China. Our results display direct and indirect effects of urban expansion on farmland loss, but also spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the urbanization patterns. While the earlier years were dominated by infill and land conversion close to city centers, the later years displayed sprawling urbanization following the constraints of terrain and administrative boundaries at the cost of farmland. Our regression analysis of spatial variables found a strong relationship with urban planning factors. The spatial analysis of urbanization patterns revealed indirect land-use change on former farmland. Furthermore, we found that regional geography and historic sites considerably influenced land conversion. Overall, our findings indicate the need for sustainable planning strategies that synthesize approaches to farmland and historic site protection and consideration of regionally specific landscape characteristics.",About Sufficiency
An eco-efficiency-based urban sustainability assessment method and its application,"It is of critical importance to develop appropriate assessment tools with which to comprehensively measure the sustainability status of a region in order to guide its transformation to sustainable development. This paper proposes a novel method of sustainability assessment based on urban eco-efficiency, which calculates the ratios of welfare and ecological impact. This method can demonstrate the relative sustainability status of targeted regions for different time periods, and it implicitly considers comprehensive urban information including ecology, economy and society. By using the human development index (HDI) and ecological footprint (EF) as measures of urban welfare and ecological burden, we carried out a case study of Xiamen City during 2000-2006 using the proposed method. The results indicated that there is a fluctuation of eco-efficiency, which shows a steady increase then a sharp decline, with a marginal increase towards the end of the studied period. Overall, eco-efficiency, resource efficiency and environmental efficiency declined 0.155-, 0.157- and 0.153-times, respectively, during this period. This means that the increase of ecological consumption is faster than improvement of social welfare. As a result, urban sustainability declines, and its future increase depend on improvements of both resource and environment efficiency. Our method proved effective in analysing the relative sustainability status among targeted regions for different time periods, paving the way for practical applications, such as policy analysis, in pursuit of sustainable development.",About Sufficiency
"An insight to municipal solid waste management of Varanasi city, India, and appraisal of vermicomposting as its efficient management approach","Varanasi, India's historic cultural capital, struggles with efficient waste management practices. This impacts environment and human well-being in terms of waste generation that is estimated around 550-650 TPD with a generation rate of 0.42 kg capita(-1) day(-1) (n=117). The present study aims to explore and characterize wastes, current practices, ecological profiling, and phytotoxicity of an abandoned open dumping site, and vermicomposting of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) as sustainable waste management approach. Compositional analysis of waste indicates organic fraction (46.13%) as a major component along with a considerable amount of heavy metals. The calorific value and moisture content of municipal solid waste (MSW) was 2351.4 cal g(-1) and 34.72%, respectively. Ecological profiling of the dumping site revealed that floral diversity and ecological species/indicators were negatively affected. Likewise, phytotoxicity results displayed a negative impact on germination and physiology of maize (Zea mays L.) plants grown on dumping site soil. Vermistabilization of OFMSW showed a significant increase in N (56.10-89.48%), P (33.93-82.87%), and K (25.55-50.42%) and a decrease in total organic carbon (15.15-24.81%). Similarly, C/N and C/P ratios decreased by 1.89-2.51 and 1.72-2.18 folds, respectively. A survey of stakeholders suggested that open dumping was the main practice adopted by Varanasi Municipal Corporation (VMC) during 2013-2015. Recently (2017-2018), VMC adopted different methods, such as door-to-door collection and source segregation for effective waste management. Waste characteristics and nutrient profile of the vermicompost explains that vermicomposting could be used for efficient waste management in Varanasi, further reducing the collection, transportation, and disposal costs of waste, which enables to close the loop and move towards a circular economy. Moreover, implications of existing waste management practices and possible management options need to be addressed scientifically. Therefore, this research outcome will help in designing a successful waste management plan for Varanasi and other cities with similar waste characteristics.",About Sufficiency
An integrated approach to place Green Infrastructure strategies in marginalized communities and evaluate stormwater mitigation,"Increasing urbanization augments impervious surface area, which results in increased run off volumes and peak flows. Green Infrastructure (GI) approaches are a decentralized alternative for sustainable urban stormwater and provide an array of ecosystem services and foster community building by enhancing neighborhood aesthetics, increasing property value, and providing shared green spaces. While projects involving sustainability concepts and environmental design are favored in privileged communities, marginalized communities have historically been located in areas that suffer from environmental degradation. Underprivileged communities typically do not receive as many social and environmental services as advantaged communities. This research explores GI-based management strategies that are evaluated at the watershed scale to improve hydrological performance by mitigating storm water run off volumes and peak flows. GI deployment strategies are developed to address environmental justice issues by prioritizing placement in communities that are underprivileged and locations with high outreach potential. A hydrologic/hydraulic stormwater model is developed using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM 5.1) to simulate the impacts of alternative management strategies. Management scenarios include the implementation of rain water harvesting in private households, the decentralized implementation of bioretention cells in private households, the centralized implementation of bioretention cells in municipally owned vacant land, and combinations of those strategies. Realities of implementing Cl on private and public lands are taken into account to simulate various levels of coverage and routing for bioretention cell scenarios. The effects of these strategies are measured by the volumetric reduction of run off and reduction in peak flow; social benefits are not evaluated. This approach is applied in an underprivileged community within the Walnut Creek Watershed in Raleigh, North Carolina. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency

AI technologies enable extensive data collection and analysis through various methods, including remote sensing and sensor networks, which improve assessments of air and water quality, land use changes, and biodiversity monitoring. Another significant advantage of AI is its ability to optimize energy consumption across various sectors, leading to substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, we demonstrate that AI enhances waste management strategies by identifying recycling opportunities and streamlining logistics, ultimately contributing to waste reduction and fostering a circular economy. In the fields of agriculture and forestry, AI systems have proven effective in improving crop management and pest control practices, mitigating environmental impacts while increasing food productivity. Furthermore, AI plays a vital role in wildlife conservation efforts by assisting in tracking endangered species and analyzing satellite imagery to combat illegal activities. We also illustrate how AI supports the development of predictive climate models, enabling policymakers to create science-based strategies for effectively navigating extreme weather and climate risks, thereby fostering resilient infrastructure decisions. While the transformative potential of AI in climate initiatives is clear, we address several limitations and ethical challenges associated with its application, including concerns about data quality and accessibility, biases in AI algorithms, and the need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making. These challenges emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and robust engagement strategies to ensure that AI applications promote equitable access to solutions for marginalized populations affected by climate change. Moreover, we examine how the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the landscape of AI for sustainable development, revealing both challenges and opportunities in implementing AI technologies. The pandemic has led to increased investment in remote monitoring technologies while highlighting the need for collaborative approaches to address the complex interdependencies between public health and climate resilience. Through a synthesis of relevant literature and case studies, we advocate for a holistic and collaborative approach to utilizing AI technologies in environmental management to achieve the SDGs successfully. By fostering innovation and inclusivity in decision-making processes, society can leverage AI's potential to create a sustainable and resilient future, thus advancing comprehensive climate action in alignment with the United Nations’ mission.HighlightsAI can boost climate action by enhancing energy efficiency, optimizing agriculture, and improving disaster response efforts.The integration of AI supports SDG-11 (Sustainable Cities) and SDG-13 (Climate Action), fostering sustainable and resilient communities.Addressing AI limitations, is crucial for effective climate solutions and achieving sustainable development goals.",About Sufficiency
Assessing sustainability of Chiang Mai urban development,"Sustainable urban development is an increasingly important concept as cities around the world continue to grow and face challenges related to urbanization, including environmental degradation, social inequality, and economic instability. Chiang Mai is a rapidly growing city in Thailand that steers towards sustainability. In this work, we examine the state of sustainable urban development in Chiang Mai by analyzing various indicators, including transportation, waste management, air quality, and energy consumption. A multi-dimensional framework was used to assess the sustainability of Chiang Mai. Our analysis suggests that while Chiang Mai has made progress in some areas of sustainable urban development, such as promoting green transportation and waste reduction and reduction consumption, there are still many challenges to be addressed, particularly in air pollution, water management, transportation and energy consumption. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for policy makers, urban planners, and other stakeholders interested in promoting sustainable urban development. This study assesses Chiang Mai's sustainability using a comprehensive set of 35 indicators. It was found that Chiang Mai has potential for sustainable development, but some indicators require improvement. The study presents guidelines for prioritizing sustainable development, improving air and water quality, promoting sustainable tourism, enhancing waste management, transportation management and energy consumption. This research provides alternative framework for evaluating cities and presents a valuable contribution to the field of sustainable urban development.",About Sufficiency
Assessing the sustainability of contrasting land use scenarios through the Socioecological Integrated Analysis (SIA) of the metropolitan green infrastructure in Barcelona,"Urban development and the sprawl of transport infrastructures have disregarded the crucial function of metropolitan landscape in provisioning human well-being and biodiversity. This research aims to contribute to the challenges of Planning for Sustainability by proposing a Socioecological Integrated Analysis (SIA) to support the Land Use Master Plan in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area, to conciliate urban development with the performance of surrounding open spaces. The paper evaluates four different land cover scenarios (current, trending, alternative and potential), and two kinds of agricultural management (conventional and a socioecological transition towards organic agriculture). The results suggest that although there are significant improvements on job provisioning and nutrient-cycling closures (circular economy), certified organic agriculture is not enough to overcome some trends of industrialized agrarian systems such as low energy efficiency or poor improvements in greenhouse gas emissions. The results also show a crossed effect between social metabolism and landscape ecology where changes in the management could affect the landscape functioning while changes in the land covers are particularly affecting the resource use. Then, deeper changes that consider together land use and metabolic flows are required to promote more sustainable agroecological transitions. The SIA model is an important conceptual and methodological step forward that facilitates the transition towards sustainable land use policies.",About Sufficiency
Assessing urban sustainability of Chinese megacities: 35 years after the economic reform and open-door policy,"Driven by unprecedented economic development for more than three decades, China's urbanization level rose from 17.9% in 1978 to 54.8% in 2014. This breakneck speed of urbanization has resulted in myriad environmental problems and social inequities. To gauge the urban sustainability of China, our study focused on ten megacities which are socioeconomic centers of the country. We evaluated the three dimensions of sustainability using a set of sustainability indicators, including Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Ecological Footprint (EF), Biocapacity, Environmental Performance Index (EPI), City Development Index (CDI), Human Development Index (HDI), Gini coefficient, and Urban-rural income ratio. Based on time-series data from 1978 to 2012, our study has produced the following findings: (1) The values of GPI for the ten megacities started to increase since 2006 after a relatively constant period between 1994 and 2005; (2) The pressures of economic growth on the environment (EF) increased while biocapacity decreased for the ten megacities, with smaller biocapacity deficits for western cities; (3) The overall level of human wellbeing (HDI) increased; (4) Socioeconomic inequality (Gini and urban-rural income ratio) widened, but the widening trend seemed to have ceased in recent years for most of the ten megacities; and (5) Certain aspects of urban environment and city development (EPI and CDI) improved gradually, particularly in waste treatment and infrastructure development. Our findings suggest that, to achieve overall urban sustainability, China must move away from maximizing economic development and focus on improving environmental quality of its megacities.

"Assessment of the first-ever circular economy framework of Cambodia: Barriers, international opportunities and recommendations","Circular Economy (CE) is a promising solution for a wide range of stakeholders, including companies, governments, and society at large to confront serious environmental concerns (Crome et al., 2023) to address resource depletion, environmental degradation, and waste generation. As Cambodia's economy heavily relies on resource extraction and export-oriented industries (e.g., textile industry and agriculture contributing significantly to GDP), it generates substantial waste (fundamentally, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), but also industrial, construction and demolition waste (UNDP, 2022a,b)), and pollution. To tackle such issues, the government has recently demonstrated a stronger commitment to sustainable development by integrating CE principles into a national policy. First, this paper explores the current environmental issues of the country. Secondly, it assessed the country's CE Strategy and Action Plan. Thirdly, as a primary finding, it was discussed the potential barriers, international collaboration prospects, and implementation recommendations to catalyze challenges into opportunities, covering the gaps observed in the country's CE Strategy and Action Plan, and following prominent CE trends. Lastly, it concludes that despite the hurdles, CE has the potential in the country to provide socioeconomic benefits, including job creation, resilience, reduced reliance on imports, and improved public health.

"Availability and Accessibility of Urban Green Spaces in a High-Density City: The Case of Raipur, India","Urban green spaces (UGS) can counter the ill effects of urbanization in high-density cities. Studies related to these aspects are rare in Indian cities, however. This article aims to assess the availability and accessibility of UGS in Raipur, India. The objectives are to identify the status of UGS alteration, determine the status of available UGS, and identify the optimum population density for which UGS can be made available and accessible. Land use change detection, fragmentation index, availability index, UGS per capita, and neighborhood accessibility are used to assess aspects of UGS. The results show an increase in built-up area (24.32 percent) from 2010 to 2020. They also show a decrease in the UGS availability index and an increase in the fragmentation index from the city center to the outskirts. Uneven distribution of UGS categories is found all over the studied urban area. Low-density areas have more UGS per capita available than high-density areas, whereas medium-high-density areas have the maximum UGS accessibility. The study concludes with density-wise implications to maximize the UGS benefits and identifies medium-high density as the optimum density that allows high accessibility to the available UGS.",About Sufficiency
Decarbonizing Local Mobility and Greenhouse Agriculture through Residential Building Energy Upgrades: A Case Study for Québec,"Electrification is an efficient way to decarbonize by replacing fossil fuels with low-emission power. In addition, energy efficiency measures can reduce consumption, making it easier to shift to a zero-carbon society. In Québec, upgrades to aging buildings that employ electric resistance heating offer a unique opportunity to free up large amounts of hydroelectricity that can serve to decarbonize heating in other buildings. However, another source of energy would be needed to electrify mobility because efficiency measures free up small amounts of electricity in summer compared to winter. This study reveals how building efficiency measures combined with solar electricity generation provide an energy profile that matches the requirements for decarbonizing both mobility and heating. The TRNSYS software was used to simulate the annual energy performance of an existing house and retrofitted/rebuilt low-energy houses equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) roof in Montreal, Québec, Canada (45.5° N). The electricity that is made available by upgrading the houses is mainly considered for powering battery and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEVs and FCEVs) and electrifying heating in greenhouses. The results indicate that retrofitting 16% or rebuilding 12% of single-detached homes in Québec can provide enough electricity to decarbonize heating energy use in existing greenhouses and to operate the new greenhouses required for growing all fresh vegetables locally. If all the single-detached houses that employ electric resistance heating are upgraded, 33.4 and 21.8 TWh year−1 of electricity would be available for decarbonization, equivalent to a 19% and 12% increase of the province’s electricity supply for the retrofitted or rebuilt houses, respectively. This is enough energy to convert 83–100% of personal vehicles to BEVs or 35–56% to FCEVs. Decarbonization using the electricity that is made available by upgrading to low-energy solar houses could reduce the province’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 32% (26.5 MtCO2eq). The time required for the initial embodied GHG emissions to surpass the emissions avoided by electrification ranges from 3.4 to 11.2 years. Building energy efficiency retrofits/rebuilds combined with photovoltaics is a promising approach for Québec to maximize the decarbonization potential of its existing energy resources while providing local energy and food security.",About Sufficiency

"Economic, social, and environmental sustainability in development theory and urban planning practice","In ten years, more than half the world's population will be living in cities. The United Nations (UN) has stated that this will threaten cities with social conflict, environmental degradation and the collapse of basic services. The economic, social, and environmental planning practices of societies embodying 'urban sustainability' have been proposed as antidotes to these negative urban trends. 'Urban sustainability' is a doctrine with diverse origins. The author believes that the alternative models of cultural development in Curitiba, Brazil, Kerala, India, and Nayarit, Mexico embody the integration and interlinkage of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Curitiba has become a more livable city by building an efficient intra-urban bus system, expanding urban green space, and meeting the basic needs of the urban poor. Kerala has attained social harmony by emphasizing equitable resource distribution rather than consumption, by restraining reproduction, and by attacking divisions of race, caste, religion, and gender. Nayarit has sought to balance development with the environment by framing a nature-friendly development plan that protects natural systems from urban development and that involves the public in the development process. A detailed examination of these alternative cultural development models reveals a myriad of possible means by which economic, social, and environmental sustainability might be advanced in practice. The author concludes that while these examples from the developing world cannot be directly translated to cities in the developed world, they do indicate in a general sense the imaginative policies that any society must foster if it is to achieve 'urban sustainability'.",About Sufficiency
Rapid rise in urban sprawl: Global hotspots and trends since 1990,"Dispersed low-density development–“urban sprawl”–has many detrimental environmental, economic, and social consequences. Sprawl leads to higher greenhouse-gas emissions and poses an increasing threat to the long-term availability of many vital ecosystem services. Therefore, urban sprawl is in stark contradiction to the principles of sustainable land use and to the need for a sustainability transformation. This study presents the degree of urban sprawl on the planet at multiple spatial scales (continents, UN regions, countries, subnational units, and a regular grid) for the period 1990–2014. Urban sprawl increased by 95% in 24 years, almost 4% per year, with built-up areas growing by almost 28 km2 per day, or 1.16 km2 per hour. The results demonstrate that Europe has been the most sprawled and also the most rapidly sprawling continent, by 51% since 1990. At the scale of UN regions, the highest relative increases in urban sprawl were observed in East Asia, Western Africa, and Southeast Asia. Urban sprawl per capita has been highest in Oceania and North America, exhibiting a minor decline since 1990, while it has been increasing rapidly in Europe, by almost 47% since 1990. The study revealed a strong relationship between urban sprawl and the level of human development as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI). The results suggest that it will be important for a more sustainable future to find a better balance between a high quality of life and using land more sparingly. There is an urgent need to stop urban sprawl, since current regulations and measures in developed countries are apparently not effective at limiting it. Monitoring urban sprawl can serve to guide policy development such as the implementation of targets and limits and to evaluate the effectiveness of urban growth management strategies at mitigating urban sprawl.",About Sufficiency
Beyond Growth: A Provincial-Level Assessment of the Doughnut Economy's Potential in Indonesia,"The focus on a growth-oriented development paradigm has led to unsustainable outcomes such as environmental degradation, resource depletion, increased inequality, and compromised social wellbeing. An alternative approach known as the Doughnut Economy has emerged, offering a new economic development model that aims to guide humanity towards staying within planetary boundaries. The Doughnut model visualizes sustainable development with an ecological ceiling as the outer limit and a social foundation as the inner boundary. This study attempts to create a Doughnut Economy Index for 34 provinces in Indonesia, categorizing them into four groups to assess how well they meet societal needs while remaining within planetary limits. The index, derived from a simple formula, yields two indices: social performance and ecological damage. The research reveals that only three out of the 34 provinces in Indonesia fall within the safe zone of the Doughnut model. Shortfall issues are prevalent in Eastern Indonesian provinces like Papua, Maluku, and Nusa Tenggara Islands, while overshoot concerns are more prominent in provinces in Kalimantan and Java & Bali Islands.",About Sufficiency
Bilevel Optimization Framework for Multiregional Integrated Energy Systems Considering 6G Network Slicing and Battery Energy Storage Capacity Sharing,"Amidst the escalating challenges of global warming and energy crises, the rapid development of distributed renewable energy resources has emerged as a critical strategy. Regional integrated energy systems (RIESs) have garnered significant attention for their potential to integrate and optimize both distributed renewable energy resources and conventional energy facilities. This article presents a bilevel optimization framework for the electricity-storage coupling market in multi-RIES, considering the integration of 6G network slicing technology and battery energy storage (BES) capacity sharing. The upper-level model maximizes the profit of generation units by optimizing their bidding strategies, while the lower-level model aims to maximize social welfare through market clearing. The proposed line search-based global Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm addresses the limitations of existing algorithms with necessary and innovative improvements to tackle the challenge of global convergence in nonsmooth optimization problems. Numerical case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating enhanced BES utilization, increased renewable energy generation, and improved social welfare. The results also highlight the sensitivity of social welfare to communication costs, underscoring the importance of careful cost calibration.",About Sufficiency
Planning and building within planetary boundaries. From the singular target of climate neutrality towards a holistic climate and resource-saving building design - a case study.,"The German government has committed to GHG neutrality by 2045. This implies the designation of a physical quantity whose zero line ensures the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. To date, a binding definition of terms with specifications on the assessment scale and method, system boundaries and on acceptable compensation measures is lacking. Since every construction process creates an ecological footprint, ‘GHG-neutral buildings’ can only be understood as a calculation model for the longer-term compensation of the climate and environmental damage that is currently being caused. A reduction to GHG-emissions thus fails to achieve the goal of building within planetary boundaries. Within the building sector, the German Climate Protection Act only takes into account energy consumption during the operational phase, leaving out emissions that occur in other life cycle stages i.e. sectors. Thus, no incentives are created to exploit a wider cross-sectoral climate and environmental protection potential of the entire buildings’ lifecycles. Existing definitions of the concept of ‘climate and GHG-neutrality’ are analysed in general and specifically in relation to buildings. Research criteria are calculation bases and life cycle-related system boundaries. Based on a built case study, life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to quantify the ‘delta’ resulting from divergent definitions in terms of GHG-emissions. This paper will quantify emissions according to divergent definitions of climate- and GHG-neutrality for a new construction scenario and also for a renovation scenario, as well as two different building material scenarios. Also, the paper will derive emission reduction potentials of sufficiency measures by applying LCA already in an early design process. To outline the role of buildings in decarbonizing the built environment, the entire life cycle is considered, including those modules that are currently outside the standard. Additional indicators (e.g. consumption of fresh water or total material input) are discussed regarding a possible shift in the ecological footprint and the building’s adherence to planetary boundaries.",About Sufficiency

Biodiversity loss through cropland displacement for urban expansion in China,"As a result of rapid economic development, urban expansion reduced the cropland in China. To secure the food supply, cropland displacement to maintain the quantity and quality of cropland has been implemented. Here, we quantified the biodiversity losses due to cropland displacement resulting from urban expansion from a telecoupling perspective in China from 1980 to 2020. A comprehensive multimodel assessment demonstrated that the indirect biodiversity losses due to cropland displacement resulting from urban expansion were approximately 2 to 3 times higher than its direct biodiversity losses, at a total loss of approximately 0.6 % to 1.0 %, as indicated by three biodiversity indicators. Displaced cropland with a higher biodiversity cost but lower cropland productivity is the main reason for the excessive indirect losses and suggests that socioecological processes may be detrimental to the synergistic benefits of the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for food security and terrestrial biodiversity. This study also identified source-sink hotspots for indirect biodiversity losses, which can contribute to improving biodiversity conservation, optimizing the spatial distribution of cropland and thus enhancing socioecological system sustainability.",About Sufficiency
Traditional African vegetables in modular living walls: a novel approach towards smart cities,"In terms of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), combined with good health and wellbeing (SDG 3), are vital. The world is not making adequate progress in meeting the UN’s targets to address food security (SDG 2). In South Africa, the growing population, rapid urbanization, poverty, and unemployment exacerbate the issue of food security; even more so considering climate change (SDG 13). The built environment needs to respond to these demands and incorporate green initiatives that can provide ecosystem services. Novel approaches are required to optimize land use and promote sustainable built environments through food production. This paper consolidates literature on local vertical urban food production with vegetable crops to enhance ecosystem services and lower the carbon footprint of buildings in the Global South. The literature review points to the potential of small-scale edible living walls that utilize local materials and traditional African vegetable (TAV) species to enhance system sustainability and resilience.

Digitally Engaged? Reflections and recommendations for engaging citizens in smart cities,"A significant cultural shift occurred over recent decades, with the majority of the world’s population now living in cities and contributing over two thirds of global carbon emissions. If countries around the world are to meet challenging global carbon reduction targets, then how our cities are governed and managed to maximize energy efficiency is of vital importance. Faith is increasingly being placed in what are commonly referred to as ‘smart cities.’ Smart cities seemingly offer a utopian vision of urban integration, efficiency and [subsequent] carbon reductions, yet urbanisation presents real challenges, as noted by Sustainable Development Goal 11: “Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”. Cities are made up of people and increasingly both policymakers and practitioners are starting to see citizens as an essential stakeholder, even if there is a blurring over the boundaries between citizens and consumers. It is unclear what these people actually refer to when they talk about citizen engagement.

Prioritizing Indicators for Material Selection in Prefabricated Wooden Construction,"Material selection in buildings profoundly affects project success, encompassing durability, maintenance, customer satisfaction, production systems, lifecycle, usage, environment, and costs. Yet, there is a need for further research on indicators for choosing materials in prefabricated buildings. Therefore, this study’s main objective was to identify the indicators (criteria and sub-criteria) for selecting materials for prefabricated wooden construction and, subsequently, categorize these criteria and sub-criteria based on the perspective of industry professionals. To achieve this goal, three phases were carried out. First, a literature review was conducted to identify potential criteria for choosing structural and envelope materials in wooden prefabricated buildings. Second, a pilot survey was conducted in Canada and the United States to classify the priority order of the criteria obtained from the literature based on professionals’ opinions. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted with different iterations (1000, 10,000, and 100,000) using the data obtained from the previous phase to improve decision-making and classification processes. For the indicators to select materials, the literature review identified seven main criteria: performance properties, green materials, energy efficiency, circular economy, site conditions and material logistics, standards, and social impact. These criteria contained a total of 25 sub-criteria. The pilot survey data analysis demonstrated that the performance properties, site conditions and material logistics, and social impact criteria were consistently prioritized.

Linking Urban Sprawl and Surface Urban Heat Island in the Teresina–Timon Conurbation Area in Brazil,"Negative consequences of urban growing disparities usually lead to impressive levels of segregation, marginalization, and injustices, particularly in the context of climate change. Understanding the relations between urban expansion and social vulnerability has become extremely necessary for municipality management and sustainable urban development. Although the study of urbanization in Latin America (LA) has been well discussed, little attention has been given to how the population is affected by urban expansion-oriented movement after the 2008 economic crisis. Massive investments in infrastructure displaced the population to peripheral zones without adequate urban planning, which reflected in alteration in land use and land cover (LULC), followed by environmental impacts and public health issues caused by thermal discomfort, notably in semiarid regions. This paper aims to evaluate the effects of urban sprawl on the Teresina–Timon conurbation (TTC) area’s local population, located in Brazil’s northeast. Descriptive metrics (Moran’s I statistic and social vulnerability index) and orbital products derived from remote sensing—LULC and Land surface temperature (LST) maps—were applied. The results indicated that the housing program ‘My House My Life’ (PMCMV) had increased the values of land consumption per capita since 2009 significantly, showing a clear expanding trend. The gradual replacement of green areas by residential settlements resulted in an increased LST. The PMCMV program contributed substantially to a change in land use and land cover, which increased the extent of urbanized areas and changed the local microclimate.",About Sufficiency

Through densification and compact building, the approach aims to counteract negative effects of urban sprawl in terms of ineffective land-use and related environmental problems. In spite of its benefits various problems and challenges are associated with implementing the compact city approach. This review looks at the effects of urban densification and compact city development on urban green space and its planning. It identifies problems, challenges and strategies of urban green space planning during densification processes. Findings confirm that urban densification processes, including consolidation and infill development, can pose a threat to urban green space. However, the literature on the compact city approach often lacks specific suggestions for urban green space conservation and planning. Provision of urban green space in compact city environments and during densification processes is described as a major challenge. Loss of private urban green space rarely seems offset by provision of more public green space.

This study investigated Enshi City, China, based on land-use data from 2000, 2010, and 2020. Throughout the two intervals, the gain of water bodies and the loss of grassland were active. Artificial surfaces increased most intensively from 2010 to 2020, with transitions from grassland and cultivated land. Edge-expansion was the dominant type of artificial surface growth. Furthermore, forests had the largest size of gain across the two intervals, and there was a substantial reduction in forest fragmentation in the western part of the city. The findings confirm that recent planning measures are effective in restoring the natural environment. The identified key areas can support sustainable forest management in urban growth.",About Sufficiency
China's renewable energy and energy efficiency policies toward carbon neutrality: A systematic cross-sectoral review,"The ambitious targets of peaking CO2 emissions before 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality before 2060 (Goal 3060) have emerged as the driving force in the development of China's low-carbon energy policy. Adopting a systematic review approach, this article provides a timely analysis of key Chinese renewable energy and energy efficiency policies under Goal 3060 across five sectors: electricity, industry, transportation, buildings, and local governments. In addition, the review identifies challenges to be addressed and offers policy recommendations. There are five main conclusions: (1) expedite the development of market-based and network-based governance systems; (2) pursue the harmonization of policies by avoiding contradiction and fragmentation; (3) develop new policies, especially in the building and transportation sectors; (4) embrace surveillance technologies to improve implementation and compliance; and (5) ensure just transition by implementing policy to reduce the negative socioeconomic impacts on fossil fuels-based communities and workers. This review serves as a useful guide for scholars interested in China's clean and low-carbon energy transition.",About Sufficiency
Circular Cities: What Are the Benefits of Circular Development?,"If cities could become regenerative and adaptive urban ecosystems, in which resource loops were closed and waste was obsolete, their ecological footprint would diminish. In addition, urban resource security would increase, the health of urban populations would improve and urban greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced. These are the principle goals under-pinning the circular city. Circular cities emerge through the process of circular development. Circular development alters cities' systems of provision to enable circular practices of inhabitants to develop. This manifests as circular food systems and construction, water and nutrient recycling; adaptive reuse of spaces and pop-up activities; bioremediation of contaminated sites and integration of blue-green infrastructure throughout cities. To transform our cities will require significant investment, political support and public engagement. If the benefits of adopting such an approach can be identified, this will begin to make the case for support. The research presented in this paper draws on an inductive and deductive content analysis of relevant literature and interviews with those implementing circular projects in European cities (London, Paris, Amsterdam and Stockholm). It provides a clear definition of the normative concept of circular development. It creates a framework of benefits which are likely to accrue from adopting this approach. It points to the synergistic benefits emerging from circular development. It also highlights problems around valuation of those benefits, the unintended consequences of circular development and the inequalities in accessing benefits across society.",About Sufficiency
Circular economy strategies for adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings to reduce environmental impacts,"Circular economy strategies seek to reduce the total resources extracted from the environment and reduce the wastes that human activities generate in pursuit of human wellbeing. Circular Economy concepts are well suited to the building and construction sector in cities. For example, refurbishing and adaptively reusing underutilized or abandoned buildings can revitalize neighborhoods whilst achieving environmental benefits. Cultural heritage buildings hold a unique niche in the urban landscape. In addition to shelter, they embody the local cultural and historic characteristics that define communities. Therefore, extending their useful lifespan has multiple benefits that extend beyond the project itself to the surrounding area, contributing to economic and social development. To explore this complex issue, the research applies systematic literature review and synthesis methods. Decision makers lack knowledge of the environmental benefits of adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings and lack tools to implement these projects. A new comprehensive circular economy framework for the adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings to reduce environmental impacts intends to meet these needs. The framework integrates methods and techniques from the building and construction literature that aim to reduce lifecycle environmental impact of buildings with a circular product supply chain approach.",About Sufficiency
Circular economy strategies for adaptive reuse of residential building,"The paper deals with the issue of the regeneration of the existing building heritage by framing the problems that characterize the relationships between users-buildings-neighbourhoods in a circular vision. Circular Economy concepts are well suited to the building and construction sector in cities. For example, refurbishing and adaptively reusing underutilized or abandoned buildings can revitalize neighborhoods whilst achieving environmental benefits. A systematic review of the literature and case studies has led to the identification of three areas of action of the CE in the regeneration of the built environment: a Macro-level (the public space), a Micro-level (the single component), a Meso-level (the building). However, the traditional approach of carrying out timely interventions aimed at responding to individual problems, be they of a structural, energetic, functional nature, relating to the building, the context or the single component is not entirely effective in terms of reformulation of the building characteristics. In this perspective, the paper suggests strategies of circular regeneration of residential buildings through adaptive solutions at room level, home level and urban in pursuit of human wellbeing.",About Sufficiency

Clarifying rebound effects of the circular economy in the context of sustainable cities,"The rebound effect is a crucial and unresolved issue for the circular economy (CE) because it can deteriorate resource efficiency that has been improved by technologies. However, academic discussions on rebound effects mostly focus on environmental issues such as the material and energy rebound. Social aspects of rebound effects including radical organizational changes and damage to workers? and citizens? health and rights are relatively ignored. From the perspective of sustainable cities, it is necessary to take care of urban stakeholders and consider both environmental and social justice to prevent different dimensions of impact. Accordingly, this paper serves to broaden academic discourses on the circular economy rebound, proposes a framework to align CE with the context of sustainable cities, and clarifies the linkages between rebound effects and different phases of CE. It is concluded that policy makers should not solely emphasize numeric indicators of resource efficiency; instead, they should articulate the social context of rebound effects and address potential impact in advance to ensure sustainability. Via the integration of interdisciplinary knowledge, open information, and moral responsibility, CE stakeholders including relevant industries, governments, and communities can together establish more socially inclusive policies and regulations in a systematic manner for sustainable cities.",About Sufficiency

Climate-neutral and Smart Cities: a critical review through the lens of environmental justice,"The political choices made by the European institutions in the last twenty years show how the conviction is increasingly rooted that the management of environmental problems and, more specifically, the fight against climate change can find a valid solution in technology and eco-innovations. This is evident starting from the last two growth strategies adopted (Europe 2020 and the European Green Deal), from the long series of measures implemented to put them into practice and from the main R&I funding programs, such as Horizon Europe. In this context, the problem of justice and inclusiveness of the various initiatives implemented is attracting growing attention. In fact, if the institutional documents assume that green and smart participated projects are also fair and inclusive, a growing body of literature based on empirical studies seems to refute this assumption. Within this framework, the present work analyses first the critical literature and then the three main preparatory documents for the Horizon Europe Mission Climate-neutral and Smart Cities, which selected 100 European cities to become climate-neutral by 2030. These have been studied through the lens of environmental justice, in order to assess the European Commission's understanding of the existing and arising equity issues in the path toward climate neutrality. The research shows that, while the first two documents seemed informed by the idea that participation automatically translates into equality, the last guidelines show a deeper acknowledgement of the multidimensional nature of environmental justice. One that, beyond participation, also considers issues of distribution, rights, responsibilities and recognition. The present work should nevertheless be understood as a preparatory, analytical tool that will require the further definition and implementation of Climate City Contracts by the selected cities, in order to assess how the issue of environmental justice is effectively being considered in each specific context.",About Sufficiency
Closing the energy divide in a climate-constrained world: A focus on the buildings sector,"Access to modern energy services in households is central to achieving decent living standards and wellbeing. Almost 3 billion people in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia still lack access to modern energy services and endure energy consumption rates equivalent to a fraction of that in developed countries. While critical for the successful achievement of several internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), closing this energy divide may pose an additional pressure on the already daunting challenge of securing climate stabilization. The ways in which this divide is closed will significantly affect the development of buildings-related emissions. This paper revisits previous work on the potential conflict between efforts towards closing the energy divide and enabling the achievement of higher levels of human well-being, and those associated with climate stabilization. It estimates the additional energy needed to achieve the former in terms of final energy consumption levels in key regions, and the associated emission pathways under different climate action scenarios. It then analyses the impact that such pathways could have on estimated carbon budgets associated with fulfilling the Paris Agreement, and provides some suggestions on how this impact could be minimized in the buildings sector.

Come hybrid or high water: Making the case for a Green-Gray approach toward resilient urban stormwater management,"120 years or more of unsustainable urban development has damaged the natural environment and disrupted essential ways to stabilize water body overflow and even mitigate pluvial flooding. In light of catastrophic flooding that has occurred globally, a renewed commitment to transforming built surfaces and incorporating more green infrastructures (GIs) has emerged. In fact, one could argue that an overcommitment to GI is being touted in the literature, but largely disconnected from more real-world possibilities, considering all things. In this commentary, we make the case that as cities transition from development patterns of the past and even considering climate-induced storm characteristics of the future, a hybridized solution (e.g., Green-Gray) should be considered. Smaller approaches to urban greening have been implemented in areas that need larger-scale restorations, thus proving to be insufficient. Likewise, the uncertainty surrounding rainfall and storm events has forced us to be more strategically balanced in our efforts to achieve resilience in our stormwater infrastructure. Hybridized solutions that include a diverse set of systems, anchored in local conditions, position us best for effective urban stormwater management. In the absence of such solutions, runoff volumes will continue to rise, flooding will prevail, and disenfranchised communities will remain disproportionately impacted by these impacts of urbanization.",About Sufficiency
"Community-led development and collective land tenure for environmental justice: the case of the Cano Martin Pena community land trust, Puerto Rico","Community-led land ownership can contribute to environmental justice in disaster-prone areas, particularly as it protects vulnerable communities from market-driven displacement often occurring after natural disasters.

It brings into focus the case of the Cano Martin Pena communities in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where residents started a Community Land Trust (CLT) in Latin America and the Caribbean, resulting from an extensive process of community participation. We highlight the importance of this case as still one of the only CLT's in the Global South, a mechanism not yet sufficiently understood as a highly developed instrument for secure land tenure and adaptation to climate change in the Global South. We analyse the mechanisms by which the CLT's collective tenure model effectively ensures greater environmental justice - both regarding ongoing flooding issues, and specific extreme natural events such as hurricanes. Collective land ownership allows residents to remain in the area despite forces of gentrification and displacement after disasters induced by global warming. We conclude with a reflection on the need for similar land-based solutions, and summon public authorities to consider these as a route to effective environmental management.",About Sufficiency

Conservation and Regeneration for a Sustainable and Circular City,"Conservation and regeneration approaches on existing buildings are the result of a system of attributes and values recognized by the human culture, which results in a framework of rules and practices that differ in different contexts. In the contemporary condition marked by the paradigm of sustainability, conservation planning is required to face the challenges of climate change, through the promotion of circular development and social inclusion, as well as the protection of ecosystems and biodiversity. The circular economy, which is based on the principles of recovery, recycling, reuse and sharing, in line with the sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda, offers the opportunity to rethink development models, in urban areas and beyond. Within this framework, the study proposes a systematization of the literature review which classifies taxonomies of values and methods to assess sustainability and circularity in urban planning and design at different urban scales. The proposed conceptual scheme is the first step for the definition of a new system of values of the existing building stock, which prove to be fundamental to guide urban transformations in the Green New Deal.",About Sufficiency
"Contesting Sustainability: Bikes, Race, and Politics in Portlandia","Despite decade old calls for a ""just sustainability,'' urban sustainability policy and practice remains oriented toward environmental outcomes and eco-lifestyle projects.

By examining a controversy over a bikeway development project in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in Northeast Portland, Oregon, this article explores how despite apolitical appeals to broadly shared values or visions of what a sustainable city ought to look like, sustainability projects can be-and perhaps should be-hotly contested. This article illustrates how sustainable development projects become sites of political debate, and provide space for environmental and social justice concerns to enter into the broader discourse on sustainability. Following the work of environmental justice advocates and scholars critiquing urban sustainability, this article contributes to the analysis and practice of efforts to advance a more socially robust, equitable, and political notion of sustainability.",About Sufficiency
Contributions of the circular economy to the UN sustainable development goals through sustainable construction,"The construction industry plays an essential role in a country's economic growth. The industry has been criticised for activities and processes that generate high volumes of waste, whilst obstructing sustainable development goal (SDGs) targets. The circular economy (CE) increases waste minimisation by keeping materials and resources in a closed loop. This concept has continued to gain positive traction as a potential solution to achieve sustainable development. The authors argue that contextualising the circular economy (CE) as part of the discourse towards implementing the United Nations (UN) SDGs Agenda 2030 is crucial for managing the increasing amounts of waste generated by the construction industry. This paper provides a framework that establishes a detailed relationship between the SDGs, construction waste management and the CE to direct future sustainable development research, policies, and innovations. The study adopted a narrative literature review methodology. Scopus and Web of Science were scoured for relevant literature published between 2015 and 2021. Initially 65 articles were identified with this number being reduced to 24 following a detailed inspection of their applicability to the study. The findings from the articles were summarized, synthesized, and incorporated into the study. A key theme that emerged was that an understanding of the SDGs-circular economy linkages in construction waste management is integral to establishing long-term innovative solutions for developing multi-sectorial measures for waste prevention, eco-design, and re-use of materials. These linkages increase competitiveness, stimulate innovation, and boost economic growth.

The study aims to catenate the different theories in Solid Waste Management to be able to re-craft a theoretical framework for Sustainable Cities. A qualitative research method was applied to consolidate and synthesize the fragmented theories on Urban Ecology, Policy Making, Eco-Innovations, Triple-Bottom Line, Waste Management and Sustainability. Formulation of policy and implementation instruments is vital tool to reinvent Waste Management Theory. Wastes disposal is a global phenomenon. As a result of theoretical analysis, urban transformation amidst economic development poses environmental degradation. Progress is inevitable, hence urban transformation occurs. The upward pressure from economic development creates downward pressure on environmental degradation. This condition when exhibited longer than necessary, stagnation proliferates and cities turned into an ecological sacrificial zone. To mitigate, formulation of policy instruments as government sticks must transpire. And at the end of the spectrum, regulations and policies embodied in the implementation instruments based on Waste Management Theory must be supported by eco-innovations. These innovations inclusive of new ideas, new behavior, processes, and products in sync in a Waste Management Program measured through environmental preservation/restoration, economic resilience, and social wellbeing commonly called as the ""Triple bottom-line"".

Spatial and territorial developments for life cycle assessment applied to urban mobility—case study on Lyon area in France,"PurposeThe environmental assessment of urban mobility, defined as the movement of people in an urban area, exceeds the scope of transportation life cycle assessment (LCA) with spatial, territorial and even social considerations. The objective of this study is to develop an original interdisciplinary method based on LCA coupled with a land use and transport interaction (LUTI) model to better consider spatial and territorial dimensions in an environmental assessment of urban mobility.MethodsSpatial and territorial issues emerge in all LCA stages for urban mobility, and this study illustrates them with an application on the Lyon urban area. To consider most individual daily trips, the geographical boundary is related to the area of influence of the city and the functional boundary includes all transportation modes, with motorized, public and non-motorized transports. The life cycle inventories (LCIs) combined EcoInvent 3.2 inventories with a specific LUTI model, named SIMBAD, local mobility surveys and an emissions and consumptions model (COPERT5). These refinements allow a spatial environmental impacts assessment of urban mobility, expressed per inhabitant per day, at different residential locations and open opportunities to develop precise assessment methods for local air pollutants with detailed description on both population and pollution concentrations.Results and discussionAt territorial scale, this study highlights the major contribution to environmental impacts from private cars (around 90%) and the relevance to consider fuel, vehicle, and infrastructure life cycles in a mobility assessment. Spatial interpretations show important variability in function of residential locations and urban form characteristics related to different mobility behaviours, distance travelled and transport technologies used. Through the proposed assessment method for local air pollution impacts on human health, hotspots are revealed in the urban area, especially in the urban centre or along main road axes. In order to test our methodology and open discussions on mobility solutions, two contrasted scenarios are explored on compact city and vehicle electrification both presenting impact transfers between global indicators or with the air pollution exposure indicator.ConclusionsUrban mobility and its related environmental burden are not only related to technological choices but are also related to spatial characteristics and territorial context. The combination of urban and spatial tools and data, such as LUTI model, with the LCA methodology improves the local representativeness of environmental assessment of mobility and enlarges the ranges of analysis and perspective.

Social media enables people-centric climate action in the hard-to-decarbonise building sector,"The building and construction sector accounts for around 39% of global carbon dioxide emissions and remains a hard-to-abate sector. We use a data-driven analysis of global high-level climate action on emissions reduction in the building sector using 256,717 English-language tweets across a 13-year time frame (2009–2021). Using natural language processing and network analysis, we show that public sentiments and emotions on social media are reactive to these climate policy actions. Between 2009–2012, discussions around green building-led emission reduction efforts were highly influential in shaping the online public perceptions of climate action. From 2013 to 2016, communication around low-carbon construction and energy efficiency significantly influenced the online narrative. More significant interactions on net-zero transition, climate tech, circular economy, mass timber housing and climate justice in 2017–2021 shaped the online climate action discourse. We find positive sentiments are more prominent and recurrent and comprise a larger share of the social media conversation. However, we also see a rise in negative sentiment by 30–40% following popular policy events like the IPCC report launches, the Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal. With greater online engagement and information diffusion, social and environmental justice topics emerge in the online discourse.

Decarbonizing Local Mobility and Greenhouse Agriculture through Residential Building Energy Upgrades: A Case Study for Quebec,"Electrification is an efficient way to decarbonize by replacing fossil fuels with low-emission power. In addition, energy efficiency measures can reduce consumption, making it easier to shift to a zero-carbon society. In Quebec, upgrades to aging buildings that employ electric resistance heating offer a unique opportunity to free up large amounts of hydroelectricity that can serve to decarbonize heating in other buildings. However, another source of energy would be needed to electrify mobility because efficiency measures free up small amounts of electricity in summer compared to winter. This study reveals how building efficiency measures combined with solar electricity generation provide an energy profile that matches the requirements for decarbonizing both mobility and heating. The TRNSYS software was used to simulate the annual energy performance of an existing house and retrofitted/rebuilt low-energy houses equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) roof in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (45.5 & DEG; N). The electricity that is made available by upgrading the houses is mainly considered for powering battery and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEVs and FCEVs) and electrifying heating in greenhouses. The results indicate that retrofitting 16% or rebuilding 12% of single-detached homes in Quebec can provide enough electricity to decarbonize heating energy use in existing greenhouses and to operate the new greenhouses required for growing all fresh vegetables locally. If all the single-detached houses that employ electric resistance heating are upgraded, 33.4 and 21.8 TWh year(-1) of electricity would be available for decarbonization, equivalent to a 19% and 12% increase of the province's electricity supply for the retrofitted or rebuilt houses, respectively. This is enough energy to convert 83-100% of personal vehicles to BEVs or 35-56% to FCEVs. Decarbonization using the electricity that is made available by upgrading to low-energy solar houses could reduce the province's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 32% (26.5 MtCO(2eq)). The time required for the initial embodied GHG emissions to surpass the emissions avoided by electrification ranges from 3.4 to 11.2 years. Building energy efficiency retrofits/rebuilds combined with photovoltaics is a promising approach for Quebec to maximize the decarbonization potential of its existing energy resources while providing local energy and food security.",About Sufficiency

Denser and greener cities: Green interventions to achieve both urban density and nature,"Green spaces in urban areas-like remnant habitat, parks, constructed wetlands, and street trees-supply multiple benefits. Many studies show green spaces in and near urban areas play important roles harbouring biodiversity and promoting human well-being. On the other hand, evidence suggests that greater human population density enables compact, low-carbon cities that spare habitat conversion at the fringes of expanding urban areas, while also allowing more walkable and livable cities. How then can urban areas have abundant green spaces as well as density? In this paper, we review the empirical evidence for the relationships between urban density, nature, and sustainability. We also present a quantitative analysis of data on urban tree canopy cover and open space for United States large urbanized areas, as well as an analysis of non-US Functional Urban Areas in OECD countries. We found that there is a negative correlation between population density and these green spaces. For Functional Urban Areas in the OECD, a 10% increase in density is associated with a 2.9% decline in tree cover. We argue that there are competing trade-offs between the benefits of density for sustainability and the benefits of nature for human well-being. Planners must decide an appropriate density by choosing where to be on this trade-off curve, taking into account city-specific urban planning goals and context. However, while the negative correlation between population density and tree cover is modest at the level of US urbanized areas (R2 = 0.22), it is weak at the US Census block level (R2 = 0.05), showing that there are significant brightspots, neighbourhoods that manage to have more tree canopy than would be expected based upon their level of density. We then describe techniques for how urban planners and designers can create more brightspots, identifying a typology of urban forms and listing green interventions appropriate for each form. We also analyse policies that enable these green interventions illustrating them with the case studies of Curitiba and Singapore. We conclude that while there are tensions between density and urban green spaces, an urban world that is both green and dense is possible, if society chooses to take advantage of the available green interventions and create it.

Determinants of households residential mobility decision in Kumasi Ghana,"Household relocation choices are critical in shaping urban socio-economic landscapes, especially within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study investigates the complex factors influencing household relocation decisions in Kumasi, Ghana, an urban center undergoing rapid growth. The aim is to understand how socio-economic conditions, environmental challenges, and urban policy dynamics interact to shape relocation intentions. Using a qualitative approach, this research use qualitative interviews and natural language processing (NLP) technique to capture the diverse push and pull factors motivating relocation. Findings indicate that push factors, such as inadequate housing, urban congestion, and environmental degradation, diminish quality of life and drive relocation. Conversely, pull factors, including employment opportunities, access to education and healthcare, and enhanced urban amenities, attract households to particular areas within Kumasi.

Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Urban Green Spaces and Climatic Vulnerability of Togolese Cities in the Context of Rapid Urbanisation: The Case of Lome and Kara,"In Togo, the cities of Lomé and Kara are undergoing rapid urbanisation driven by strong population growth and the expansion of urban built-up areas, leading to significant reductions in urban green spaces (UGSs). UGSs are vital for climate regulation and human well-being by mitigating urban heat, improving air quality, and supporting mental health. This urban expansion directly replaces vegetated areas with impervious surfaces, diminishing UGS and their associated ecosystem services. Consequently, climatic vulnerability has increased, highlighting the need for sustainable urban development and UGS conservation. This study examines UGS spatiotemporal dynamics using Landsat imagery from 1988, 2000, 2012, and 2022, applying a supervised image classification approach with the maximum likelihood algorithm. Post-classification change detection quantified UGS loss. Additionally, vulnerability models for 2022, 2060, and 2100 were developed using Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP 2.45 and SSP 5.85) and a multifactorial modelling approach. The results reveal a decline in UGSs from 85.98% to 40.78% in Lomé and from 93.99% to 36.68% in Kara between 1988 and 2022, primarily due to urbanisation.

Digital twin-driven strategic demolition plan for circular asset management of bridge infrastructures,"Economic growth plays an important role in the rapid increase in construction of transportation and bridge infrastructures, which in turn causes enormous greenhouse gas emissions contributing directly to climate change. An innovative and effective method, so-called Building Information Modeling (BIM), to sustainably manage detailed lifecycle of infrastructures, has been recently adopted to revolutionise the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Its major function is to sustainably optimise all detailed stages of an infrastructure asset’s lifecycle. A three-dimensional architectural BIM incorporating three additional dimensions (time, cost, and carbon emissions) has then been created in this study to virtualise the whole lifecycle performance of bridge infrastructure through BIM data. For circular asset management, multi-scale details of assets and infrastructures are indispensable. On this ground, these information dimensions are highly critical to asset managers to assure not only public safety, but also sustainability over the whole lifecycle. It is thus critical to quantify carbon footprint in order to identify better alternative solutions for construction and maintenance, resulting in carbon neutrality and carbon credit. Our digital twin (DT), driven by the BIM, has embedded demolition scenarios whose lifecycle cost and carbon footprint can be quantified and optimized simultaneously. Our study is the first to also demonstrate circular end-of-life management through strategic demolition planning that enhances circular economy practice. This aspect is novel and has not been commonly adopted in practice. Our study reveals that the construction stage of the asset lifecycle for this study is the main contributor to carbon emissions and costs stemming from raw materials and their productions. This eventually leads to significant waste at the end of asset’s life, requiring strategic demolition plan to maximise reuse, repurpose, and recycle of materials, parts and components. Our innovative DT is capable of dealing with the cradle-to-cradle lifecycle management. Another co-benefit of using the BIM-based digital twin is to minimise streamlining design, re-work, mitigating risk, and real time processing of design changes in all stakeholders, reducing the effect on carbon emissions, costs, and time schedules. All dimensions (i.e. 6D) can be updated and re-calculated in real time when cross-linked with inspections and condition monitoring, generating real-time digital twin driven solutions.",About Sufficiency

Paradoxically, technology is also contributing to loneliness, anxiety, and depression among urban populations, and raises nuanced questions about access and inclusivity in increasingly digitized urban settings. In this contribution, we consider the possibilities and challenges inherent in applying digital technologies to leverage the development of inclusive and diverse circular economic spaces around a city's reuse, repair and recycling infrastructure and drive socio-ecological transformations of urban spaces. We conclude that uneven access to digital tools potentially reinforces existing urban social inequalities, and that emphasis must be placed on understanding how technologies should be more effectively designed and leveraged for a socially inclusive circular economy in the city.",About Sufficiency
Does Circular Economy Contribute to Smart Cities’ Sustainable Development?,"The purpose of this research paper is to investigate and identify the factors which can support the development of one characteristic of smart cities, namely, the smart environment. More specifically, the main goal is to measure the extent to which air pollution may be reduced, taking as determinants several circular economy, fiscal, and environmental factors. The Ordinary Least Squares, the Fixed Effects, and Random Effects regression models using balanced panel data were employed, over the 2011–2019 period, for 28 European states. After rigorously studying the literature, 11 indicators with a predictable impact on the exposure to air pollution were kept. According to current analysis, the most effective methods of reducing air pollution are the use of renewable energy, the investments in educating the population to reduce pollution, the proper implementation of the circular economy, and the adoption of the most suitable policies by the European Union governments. Particular attention needs to be paid to factors such as carbon dioxide-generating activities, which are significantly increasing the air pollution. Another strong value is that of providing information on the assessment of ambient air quality, and on the promotion of appropriate policies to achieve two major objectives: well-being, and sustainable cities.",About Sufficiency
"Direct and indirect loss of natural habitat due to built-up area expansion: A model-based analysis for the city of Wuhan, China","Urbanization has been responsible for the loss of cropland worldwide, especially in China. To guarantee national food security, China has implemented a series of policies to protect cropland. One of these policies requires that one-hectare cropland should be reclaimed when urban expansion occupies one-hectare cropland. Since most cropland reclamation leads to a conversion of natural habitat, such as wetland and grassland, urban expansion may lead to (indirect) natural habitat loss in addition to direct loss from conversion of into urban area. While several studies assessed the direct habitat loss resulted from built-up area expansion, few studies investigated the indirect losses caused by cropland displacement. In this paper, a model based approach is applied to explore both direct and indirect impacts of built-up area expansion on natural habitat loss for the city of Wuhan, China, between 2010 and 2020 using different scenarios. Our scenarios differ in the implementation of strict cropland protection policies and ecosystem conservation strategies. Results show that the indirect loss of natural habitat due to cropland displacement under strict cropland protection policies far outweighs the direct loss due to built-up area expansion alone. Moreover, we found that ecosystem conservation strategies mainly influence the type of natural habitat that is affected, while the total amount of natural habitat loss remains relatively constant.",About Sufficiency
Disproportionate impacts of building materials production facilities on neighboring communities,"The construction and building materials (CBMs) production industries, such as cement, steel, and plastics that are responsible for a substantial share of global CO2 emissions, face increasing pressure to decarbonize. Recent legislative initiatives like the United States (US) federal Buy Clean Initiative and the World Green Building Council's decarbonization plan for Europe highlight the urgency to reduce emissions during CBM production stages. However, there remains a gap in addressing the localized environmental and social impacts of these industries as well as a necessary understanding of how decarbonization efforts may change local impacts. This study introduces a framework for quantifying the disproportionate impacts (Id) of 12 CBM production facility categories on communities of color and low-income demographics across the US. Using geographical and environmental data from the 2017 US National Emissions Inventory (NEI), we assess these impacts at four spatial scales: census tract, county, state, and national. Results show that across all scales, many CBM production facilities impose disproportionate impacts. The geographical disproportionate impact (IG,d) shows the greatest burdens at the broadest spatial scales, whereas the environmental disproportionate impact (IE,d) indicates highest burdens at more localized levels. Based on this spatial understanding, we provide methods that can be implemented to support community engagement and mitigate damages to populations neighboring industrial materials manufacturing. These findings offer valuable insights into the relationship between facility locations, emissions, and demographic groups, providing a basis for more targeted environmental justice policies aimed at mitigating these disproportionate impacts.",About Sufficiency
Disrupting comfort: From low-carbon to low-impact cities,"In this commentary, we argue for the low-impact city as an alternative to the dominant urban imaginary of the low-carbon city. We adopt an ecological economics lens to expose the limitations of the urban resource efficiency paradigm when tackling environmental degradation beyond city boundaries. Based on the interpretation of urbanisation as a material practice, we urge for a fundamental recalibration of sustainability paradigms in urban planning. To integrate the impacts of urbanisation on non-urban landscapes within the framework of urban sustainability science, we furthermore stress the urgent need for frugality, resource reduction, and inclusiveness in urban planning practice.",About Sufficiency
Drosscapes and new urban metabolism. New strategies and tools for sustainable and resilient regeneration,"To contribute to the debate on the relationship between regeneration and urban morphology, the illustrated study seeks to understand how the prediction of new multi-scale, multidimensional and integrated planning tools based on sustainable and resilient strategies, can guarantee high levels of urban, environmental, energy efficiency and resource circularity quality, counteracting the effects of climate change, landscape-environmental degradation and socio-economic marginality. Starting from the analysis of the complex socio-political framework and from some design and regulatory references that integrate in planning, a new model of ecologically oriented city, the contribution identifies in the enhancement of drosscapes as a new design metaphor that can improve biodiversity, encourage ecological and energy transition, restore, with natural solutions, the quality of air environmental matrices, water and soil, triggering a new urban metabolism. Through the application of an iterative and interscalar methodology articulated in levels and phases to a study area lying in the Roman suburbs and subjected to the procedure of the urban project, the contribution proposes a reflection on the need to implement design strategies capable of counteracting dissipative dynamics, building resilient landscapes, sustainable energy cycles within ecological regeneration scenarios, morphological reconfiguration of urban fabrics and public spaces related to the promotion of an efficient city, smart and green. In this perspective, it highlights the potential and limits of the proposed experimentation, both in terms of the quality and innovativeness of the design solutions, and in terms of possible evolutionary lines that could raise the levels of settlement and environmental quality, of social inclusion and economic growth.",About Sufficiency
Revisiting urban sustainability from access to jobs: Assessment of economic gain versus loss of social equity,"This study has aided an understanding of how the built environment impacts multiple facets of sustainability from perspective of job access that potentially assist in environmental protection, economic development, and social justice. However, the latter two contributions entail tradeoffs that are little-discussed in empirical research. We elaborate upon the manner in which job access affects economic and social sustainability and focus on tradeoffs between the two. We measure and characterize the impact of job access on housing prices and the spatial distribution of disadvantaged populations across New York City, using census data. Results document not only that there are significant positive effects of job access on housing but also that higher housing prices screen out disadvantaged populations and undermine social equity. Findings highlight the paradox in sustainable development that job access seldom exhibits simultaneous positive effects on economic and social equity. We propose that urban built environment might have sigificantimpact on and might be a solution to the tension between economic benefits and social loss regarding job accessibility. That is, appropriate spatial land use planning and public policies could maximize individual welfare and sustainability for future cities-a new perspective of achieving urban sustainability. The major challenge is finding a workable balance between economic and social sustainability that is theoretically sound and empirically feasible.",About Sufficiency
Economic Sustainability and 'Missing Middle Housing': Associations between Housing Stock Diversity and Unemployment in Mid-Size US Cities,"Single-family detached homes-the lowest-density housing type-continue to dominate the U.S. home construction industry. These homes are carbon-intensive and automobile dependent; the built environments they produce militate against civic relations and attitudes. Cities need to increase density, support multimodality, and develop social capital, but these issues are not propelling cities to diversify their housing stock. The objective of this research is to facilitate this shift by establishing economic arguments for increased density and housing diversity. Municipal-level U.S. Census data is used to explore the interurban relationships between diversity in housing stocks and unemployment rates in 146 mid-size American cities. A measure of diversity, Shannon's H, is applied to housing stock and found to be strongly associated with lower unemployment for workers over 25 years old after controlling for measures of urban social burden. In contrast to the much-heralded ""trade-offs"" between environmental quality, social equity, and economic development, these findings suggest that the dense, walkable, low-carbon city, and the economically sustainable city might be the same place.",About Sufficiency
Ecosystem Connectivity for Livable Cities: a Connectivity Benefits Framework for Urban Planning,"Urbanization disrupts landscapes and ecosystem functions, which poses threats to biodiversity, social systems, and human health, particularly among vulnerable populations. Urban land-use planners are faced with competing demands for housing, safety, transportation, and economic development and often lack tools to integrate these with protecting environmental functions. We identify three major barriers to integrating the benefits that flow with connected, functioning ecosystems into land-use planning. The lack of a shared language among planners and stakeholders poses a barrier to the restoration and preservation of ecological features. Methods of incorporating the benefits from connectivity are not standardized because values are not readily available or lack credibility. Ecological restoration tends to be poorly coordinated at broad scales, and thus often fails to achieve landscape-level objectives. To address these challenges, we developed a novel integrated framework, the Connectivity Benefits Framework (CBF), which combines the benefits from three categories of ecosystem connectivity with benefit-and risk-relevant indicators, enabling both monetary and non-monetary valuation of benefits. Moreover, it provides a method to identify and visualize the multiple and overlapping benefits from management actions to aid in prioritizing initiatives that support ecosystem functions. Unlike software tools that incorporate generalized values of ecosystem services at a landscape level, the CBF guides a systematic approach to community-engaged land-use planning that prioritizes localized societal needs while protecting biodiversity and ecosystem function for more equitable, resilient cities. We demonstrate the potential for multiple overlapping benefits from actions that restore and protect ecosystem connectivity by applying the framework to a transit planning project in Portland, Oregon.",About Sufficiency

Effect of Distinct Land Use Patterns on Quality of Life in Urban Settings,"From an academic perspective, compact land use and spatial development patterns are regarded as the primary aspects of urban development for environmental sustainability and government financing. However, whether these aspects concur with residents' perceived quality of life is unclear. Because of differences in spatial structures, residents in sprawling and compact development areas differ in their perceptions and levels of satisfaction regarding quality of life. Identifying the characteristics of and differences among quality of life perceptions can facilitate the clarification of whether sustainable development and growth management fit the expectations of urban residents. This study examined the Taipei metropolitan area. In the survey, questionnaire copies were distributed to residents in sprawling and compact development areas. Structural equation modeling was applied to the collected data to explore the differences in residents' perceptions of and satisfaction with quality of life. The study findings revealed that street space, commercial functions, neighborhood relationships, and household finances were four aspects exerting a significant effect on residents' perceptions of and satisfaction with overall quality of life in sprawling development areas.

Effectiveness of urban construction boundaries in Beijing: an assessment,"Based on the remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) analysis of the Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) and thematic mapper (TM) satellite images of 1983, 1993, and 2005, the present research examined the effectiveness of the urban construction boundaries (UCBs) in containing urban growth within the 6th Ring Road of Beijing Municipality. Three indicators on boundary control were proposed, through which the effectiveness of boundary containment, land inventory sufficiency and illegal adjacent development to the UCBs were explored. The results suggested that, first, the UCBs were limited in effectiveness in containing urban growth; second, the area encompassed by the UCBs might not be designed large enough to accommodate new development. The frustration of the urban growth control through the UCBs mainly resulted from the lack of a transparent system for urban land use planning and control to provide sufficient information, the limitation of the traditional land use prediction method to consider contingencies, and the absence of a mechanism to monitor and adjust the UCBs to respond just in time to urban change.",About Sufficiency
"Embodied life cycle impacts of lightweight building methods for affordable houses in the USA: Comparison of conventional, circular, and regenerative strategies","The transition to more circular practices in the construction sector offers an alternative to linear processes that are highly polluting and wasteful. Recent life cycle assessment (LCA) studies emphasize the relevance of the end-of-life scenario, highlighting its potential for impact reduction through circular strategies. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in the LCA literature on reducing the environmental impacts of affordable housing. Whole-building LCAs of three affordable homes built using a variety of lightweight construction methods in the southern United States were conducted to examine the environmental impacts of commonly used construction solutions for single-family affordable housing in the southern US and assess the extent to potential environmental impact mitigation through the introduction of additional circular strategies or the use of regenerative materials. In addition to the conventional as-built scenario, five hypothetical scenarios were considered in this study to evaluate the influence of different end-of-life options, namely, reduced recycling rates, increased recycling or reuse rates, and substitution of conven-tional insulation or finish materials with equivalent options from regenerative sources. The study aims to identify further opportunities for and limits to impact mitigation. The results show that the design and construction priorities should be (1) promoting proper end-of-life strategies for metals and wood-based materials, (2) replacing non-renewable materials with renewable wood or earth materials, and (3) increasing the reuse rate of materials and diverting construction waste. The study findings will support decision-making processes concerning the design and construc-tion of low-impact affordable single-family homes and the development and implementation of affordable housing policies and regulations, resulting in greater environmental justice and a more equitable and sustainable built environment.",About Sufficiency
"Enabling Technologies for Urban Smart Mobility: Recent Trends, Opportunities and Challenges","The increasing population across the globe makes it essential to link smart and sustainable city planning with the logistics of transporting people and goods, which will significantly contribute to how societies will face mobility in the coming years. The concept of smart mobility emerged with the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. A reduction in traffic congestion and new route optimizations with reduced ecological footprint are some of the essential factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects must also be taken into account, such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility, encouraging the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Big Data technology will serve as the main entry points and fundamental pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions that will change the current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, traffic flow optimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are some of the services and applications that will encompass several changes in the coming years with the transition of existing cities into smart cities. This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support it. An overview of how smart mobility fits into smart cities is provided by characterizing its main attributes and the key benefits of using smart mobility in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights other various opportunities and challenges related to smart mobility.

Energy infrastructure transitions and environmental governance,"At a time of great urgency for transitions to sustainability in light of climate mitigation targets, energy infrastructure is in a state of flux. Expansions in renewable energy and the persistent grasp of fossil fuels over a historically centralised sector surface new challenges of socio-spatial and environmental justice. Where does new energy infrastructure appear, how is this decided, who benefits and who is burdened? What land uses are displaced and with what socio-ecological implications? This collection pulls together insights from environmental and land governance, ethnographic studies of situated social identities, and emerging conceptualisations of energy infrastructure to address these concerns. It features contributions focused at multiple scales - the urban, regional, national and trans-local - and informed by a variety of cognate conceptual lenses: political ecology, human geography, social anthropology, urban studies, socio-technical transitions and epistemic politics. Examining cases from three continents, both the Global South and North, the theme issue presents an array of perspectives from established and emerging scholars.

Energy Poverty and Social Welfare: Its Measurement Analysis and Moderating Mechanism Evaluation,"Energy poverty has become a significant global challenge, especially in China, the largest developing country, where the problem of energy poverty is more complex and diverse than that of developed countries. In this study, a Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI) was constructed from three dimensions: energy-use level, structure, and capacity. Social welfare is quantified using the regional Development and Living Index (DLI) and the spatial effect of MEPI on social welfare is explored using a spatial Durbin model. The findings indicate that energy poverty has a detrimental impact on local and surrounding areas' social welfare. The energy-use level poverty has the most pronounced negative spillover effect, followed by the energy-use structure poverty, while the energy-use capacity poverty has the weakest impact. Strategies such as high-efficiency energy structure and formal environmental regulation, can mitigate local welfare challenges. Moreover, low-carbon energy structure can mitigate surrounding areas' welfare challenges. Additionally, the welfare effects of informal regulation and technological innovation have yet to be fully realized. Based on these conclusions, we provide recommendations to policy-makers on how to alleviate energy poverty and promote sustainable development. These include increasing funding for renewable energy projects in the central and western regions, promoting energy efficiency and consumption management in urban and industrial areas, enforcing environmental protection laws, fostering green technology innovation, and enhancing cooperation among regions.",About Sufficiency
Enhancing the Cultural Heritage through Adaptive Reuse. A Multicriteria Approach to Evaluate the Castello Visconteo in Cusago (Italy),"Cultural heritage can play a strategic role in developing a sustainable built environment, contributing to the improvement of the economic, social, and environmental productivity of a city. Human activities are constantly affecting the quality of the environment and altering the ecosystems, which produce negative consequences also on human wellbeing. Within this context, it has been much discussed how cities and the built environment can counteract this process by supporting more sustainable development. Adaptive reuse is defined as ""a process that changes a disused or ineffective item into a new item that can be used for a different purpose"", which strongly triggers the sustainable development of cities. It can be recognized as a promoter of economic growth, social wellbeing, and environmental preservation, given its capability of both preserving past values and creating new ones. The adaptive reuse matches the main points of the circular economy, seen as the sustainable economy, which is aimed at the reduction of natural resource extraction and environmental impact by extending the useful life of materials and promoting recovery, reuse, and regeneration processes. Given these premises, the current contribution aimed to evaluate alternative scenarios for reuse in Castello Visconteo in Cusago, located in the Lombardy region (Italy), and understanding how adaptive reuse could contribute to generating new values within a circular economy perspective. In detail, four alternative scenarios were proposed to face the new needs born during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Since both intangible and tangible values must be considered, a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been applied by combining economic and qualitative indicators to define the most suitable function for its adaptive reuse. In detail, the Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments (NAIADE) was used to identify the best alternative solution based on the opinions of conflicting stakeholders. The innovativeness of the contribution is given by the combination of different methodologies, the preservation of the memory and the generation of new values, and the consideration of adaptive reuse as a strategy for the achievement of sustainable development within a circular economy perspective.",About Sufficiency
"Environmental Performance and SDGs: How Do Income Disparity, Urbanization, Resource Consumption, and Female Employers Affect the Ecological Footprint in Emerging Economies?","The significance of environmental deterioration as a pressing issue has led to its prominence in global discussions on strategies for prevention. It can be asserted that there exists a universal agreement that the enhancement of environmental quality is imperative for the promotion of sustainable development and societal well-being, especially in emerging economies. In this perspective, the present research uses panel data of the E7 economies from 1992 to 2021 to assess the effects of income disparity, urbanization, resources consumption (nonrenewable and renewable energy consumption), and women employers on ecological footprint. This study employs second-generation empirical techniques such as CIPS and CADF unit root tests, Westerlund bootstrap cointegration, and DFE/MG/PMG-ARDL models to check the relationships between the studied variables. The empirical findings of this study reveal that in the E7 countries, the ecological footprint is increased with an increased income disparity and nonrenewable energy consumption. On the other hand, urbanization, renewable energy consumption, and female employers help reduce the ecological footprint. Additionally, the results of the causality measure under the Dumitrescu and Hurlin test unveil bidirectional causality between all the independent variables except nonrenewable energy and ecological footprint. From the policy perspective, the selected countries must implement policies that promote equitable income distribution, planned urbanization to promote compact cities, efficient transportation systems, and green infrastructure, and provide opportunities for women to attain higher positions in organizations, particularly at the managerial and decision-making levels in order to address the adverse environmental consequences in emerging economies.",About Sufficiency
Envisioning carbon-smart and just urban green infrastructure,"To address the inter-connected climate and biodiversity crises, it is crucial to understand how multifunctional urban green infrastructure (UGI) is perceived to contribute to carbon neutrality, biodiversity, human well-being, and justice outcomes in cities. We explore how urban residents, including youth, associate carbon-related meanings with multifunctional UGI and how these meanings relate to co-benefits to biodiversity, well-being, and broader sustainability outcomes. Our findings are based on a survey distributed among urban residents of Helsinki, Finland (n = 487) and reveal how carbon-related meanings of UGI manifest at different levels of abstraction, agency, and scale, and incorporate community values and concerns attributed to the planning, features, functions, and transformational dimensions of UGI. Core carbon-related meanings of UGI emphasize either actions towards sustainability, carbon neutrality, biodiversity, or unfamiliarity towards such meanings. Perceived justice concerns and the socio-demographic contexts of the respondents covaried with carbon-related meanings associated with UGI. The results illustrate community perceptions of how it is not only possible, but rather expected, that multifunctional UGI is harnessed to tackle climate change, human well-being, and biodiversity loss in cities. Challenges for implementing the carbon-related benefits of UGI include navigating the different expectations placed on UGI and including residents with diverse socio-economic backgrounds during the process. Our findings contribute to a holistic understanding of how multifunctional UGI can help bridge policy agendas related to carbon neutrality, biodiversity protection, and human well-being that cities can implement when aiming for sustainable, just, and socially acceptable transitions towards a good Anthropocene.",About Sufficiency
Evaluating socio-economic and subjective well-being impacts of coal power phaseout in China,"Over the past decade, China has undergone an ambitious coal power phaseout that has induced a set of socio-economic rearrangements. To provide new insights into the socio-economic effects of this phaseout in addressing global climate change, we conducted an empirical analysis at both the macro and micro levels in China from 2014 to 2020. We found that the negative impacts of this phaseout led to 3.1% and 1.9% decreases in annual income for rural and urban populations, respectively. Despite facing macro-economic challenges, individuals report overall increased levels of happiness and life satisfaction. Collectively, these findings reveal a phenomenon in which macro socio-economic performance and subjective well-being (SWB) are driven in different directions during the phaseout. Our study uncovers potential socio-economic injustices as well as opportunities in the context of the coal power phaseout, highlighting the importance of flexibility in designing decarbonization strategies.The rapid coal power phaseout is expected to lead to uncertain socio-economic consequences.

"Exploring the Impacts of Living in a ""Green"" City on Individual BMI: A Study of Lingang New Town in Shanghai, China","Urban planning and design in the 21st century is increasingly focusing on sustainability, illustrated by the proliferation of greener cities. While operational definitions and the actual planning of these cities can vary considerably (e.g., eco cities and low carbon cities), conceptually, at least, these terms overlap, particularly with regard to how they attempt to achieve both greener infrastructural design and healthier human lifestyles. This paper presents the findings of survey-based research carried out within Lingang New Town in Shanghai in 2019. In the cities of the Global North, the interplay between green infrastructural provision and public health has been of interest, especially in the context of social inequalities; however, there is little research from rapidly urbanizing countries where green urbanism is being increasingly promoted. Using this newly constructed example, we identified a clear positive correlation between moving to a green city and the adoption of healthier lifestyles. The structural equation modelling results suggest that behaviors around the use of green space as well as perceptions of different green space have notable impacts on residents' physical health, measured by body mass index (BMI).

We conducted a large-scale mobile measurement campaign and employed a gradient boost model to generate exposure surfaces using land use, built environment, and meteorological conditions. The Ontario Marginalization Index was used to quantify various indicators of social disadvantage for Toronto's neighborhoods. Our findings reveal that people in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas experience elevated UFP exposures. We highlight significant disparities in accessing sustainable transportation, particularly in areas with higher ethnic concentrations. When factoring in daily mobility, UFP exposure disparities in disadvantaged populations are further exacerbated. Furthermore, individuals who do not generate emissions themselves are consistently exposed to higher UFPs, with active transportation users experiencing the highest UFP exposures both at home and at activity locations. Finally, we proposed a novel index, the Community Prioritization Index (CPI), incorporating three indicators, including air quality, social disadvantage, and sustainable transportation. This index identifies neighborhoods experiencing a triple burden, often situated near major infrastructure hubs with high diesel truck activity and lacking greenspace, marking them as high -priority areas for policy action and targeted interventions.",About Sufficiency
Green gentrification & the luxury effect: uniting isolated ideas towards just cities for people & nature,"The growth of cities creates challenges to biodiversity and social justice. Researchers addressing these challenges often do so in silos; their efforts persistently separate justice for non-humans and humans. We analyze this separation through two concepts—luxury effect and green gentrification—that each explores urban greenspace and justice, but from different angles. The luxury effect implicitly targets justice for non-humans by exploring biodiversity in cities and finds that wealth explains the distribution of biodiversity. Green gentrification explicitly targets justice for humans by examining how new greenspaces affect people and finds that such greenspaces often displace vulnerable people. Using scientometric analyses, we show the disjunction between these concepts. We draw on socio-ecological justice concepts to suggest that disregarding relationships and conflicts among humans and non-humans in concepts does not eliminate them in practice, but stalls progress toward just cities. We urge scholars to simultaneously focus on justice for humans and non-humans.",About Sufficiency

The EU encourages national governments to prioritize zero-emission urban transport systems that emphasize safety, accessibility, and inclusiveness. Promoting walking plays a fundamental role in sustainable urban mobility, offering advantages such as emission reduction, better air quality, and enhanced public health. Recent research underscores the importance of creating appealing and safe pedestrian environments to encourage walking. These efforts align with the United Nations' Agenda 2030 sustainability goals, particularly Objective 11, which aims to build inclusive, safe, and sustainable cities and communities. This paper explores the factors influencing pedestrians' willingness to walk and categorizes them into basic factors, performance factors, and excitement factors, on the basis of the three factors theory. Significantly, the study reveals that the importance of these factors varies based on demographics, mainly the age of the users. Understanding these factors and their relative significance for pedestrian satisfaction is crucial for shaping effective policies and urban planning strategies aimed at promoting sustainable mobility. By prioritizing pedestrian satisfaction and addressing the specific needs and preferences of diverse groups, cities can create more walkable and environmentally friendly urban environments. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners working toward EU climate-neutral objectives and enhancing the well-being of citizens.",About Sufficiency
Building within planetary boundaries: setting and assessing absolute sustainability targets at the building level,"The planetary boundaries (PBs) are a widely used framework defining a “safe operating space” for environmental sustainability at the global level. However, they do not straightforwardly translate into indicators applicable in a building project. This paper proposes a procedure to set and assess absolute sustainability targets related to the PBs in a building project, exemplified in the case of Denmark. The first step is to ensure that the targets and the assessment method use comparable indicators. Common building life cycle assessment (LCA) tools use impact categories that do not directly match the PBs. Two options are considered to address this issue. Dedicated characterization factors can be used to convey LCA results in indicators consistent with the PBs. Alternatively, PB targets can be converted into LCA impact categories. Then, several distributive justice principles are reviewed to allocate a share of planetary sustainability targets to an individual country, to the housing sector within that country, and to an individual project. We argue that principles that conserve existing unsustainable paradigms are not appropriate to set planetary sustainability targets, and propose a novel approach for sectorial allocation based on sufficientarianism and “decent living” scenarios. Finally, challenges related to the assessment of these targets are highlighted. In particular, the paper draws attention to differences in system boundaries between the LCA and the targets.",About Sufficiency
From income and housing wealth inequalities to emissions inequality: carbon emissions of households in China,"The emerging notion of emissions inequality expands the idea of sustainability by incorporating economic opportunity as well as social needs and rights into environmental costs and benefits. In China, increasing inequality among urban households in terms of both income and housing wealth establishes a pattern of social stratification. An understanding of the association of social and environmental inequality is thus critical for urban sustainability. Based on the Chinese urban household survey from 2002 to 2009, this article employs the lifestyle approach to calculate and analyse the inequality of households by direct and indirect carbon emissions. The correlations among carbon emission inequality with income and housing wealth inequality are estimated with a Heckman procedure. We find that not only income distribution but also housing wealth distributionis an important consideration in understanding environmental inequality in China.",About Sufficiency
Functional analysis of web-based GIS tools for environmental justice assessment of transportation projects,"Environmental justice - the concept that environmental amenities and burdens should be shared equitably among all races and socioeconomic classes - has gained diplomatic traction internationally, and political traction domestically in the United States, in recent years. In this paper, we focus on developing federal policy relevant to transportation project planning and operation in the U.S.; however, these developments reflect international issues of inequity associated with climate change and environmental burdens. First, we provide an overview of federal policy initiatives related to environmental justice, including President Biden's Justice40 initiative. Then, we examine the U.S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as a potential avenue for mandating environmental justice assessment in the transportation industry, through the lenses of both procedural and distributive justice. Finally, we review several publicly available online Geographical Information System (GIS) tools that were recently developed for purposes of expanding public and governmental understanding of environmental justice challenges, and provide decision support for users to incorporate these tools into the environmental impact assessment process for transportation projects.",About Sufficiency
"Clustering Open Data for Predictive Modeling of Residential Energy Consumption across Variable Scales: A Case Study in Andalusia, Spain","The energy budget of households, linked to residential energy consumption (REC), serves as a critical indicator of quality of life and economy trends. Despite the lack of widely available accurate statistics at regional or smaller scales, they are of crucial interest for a better understanding of the features influencing REC and its impact on energy poverty, wellbeing, and the climate crisis. This research aims to present a new information model for predictive parameters and REC forecasting through an innovative use of available open data. Geoprocessing, data mining, and machine learning clustering algorithms were applied to open datasets of location, population, and residential building stock parameters highly correlated with their REC, on the ensemble of 785 municipalities of Andalusia, Spain. The model identified 65 clusters of towns sharing the same potential REC, with 73% of the population concentrated in 10 of these. The resulting data-driven bottom-up model of provincial REC had a mean absolute error of only 0.63%. Furthermore, it provided the territorial distribution, with local resolution, of the identified clusters of cities with similar characteristics. This methodology, with a flexible regional- to city-scale analysis, provides knowledge generation that offers numerous practical applications for energy policy planning. Its future implementation would assist stakeholders and policymakers in enhancing the performance and decarbonization of the residential building stock.",About Sufficiency
"Assessing Urban Agriculture’s Potential for Biodiversity Conservation, Carbon Sequestration, and Community Development: A Comparative Study of Residents’ Perceptions in Three Western Romanian Cities","Urban agriculture is increasingly recognized as a strategy for enhancing sustainability and well-being in urban areas, mainly through circular economy principles. This study investigates residents’ perspectives from three major cities in western Romania—Arad, Timișoara, and Oradea—on the implementation and benefits of urban agriculture. The main goal was to identify differences in opinions regarding urban agriculture’s potential to improve biodiversity conservation, enhance carbon dioxide retention, and reduce synthetic compound usage. The research also explored community development through circular economy practices and tools local authorities could use to promote urban agriculture. A survey of 573 respondents utilized variance analysis and the Tukey test to reveal significant opinion differences among residents. The findings showed notable variations in views on biodiversity conservation and community development benefits but no significant differences in opinions on carbon dioxide capture or synthetic chemical use. Residents of Timișoara and Oradea expressed more favorable views on urban agriculture than those in Arad. Participants emphasized the importance of free land allocation and sustainable practices for successful urban agriculture implementation. This study offers valuable insights for policymakers and contributes to the understanding of urban sustainability and the role of urban agriculture in supporting circular economy principles.",About Sufficiency
Urban green infrastructure accessibility for the achievement of SDG 11 in rapidly urbanizing cities of Ethiopia,"Rapid urban expansion across the globe has created enormous problems on human wellbeing and the environment. In this regard, urban green infrastructure has played a major role in improving the quality of life and is perceived as one of the vital instruments for attaining sustainable development goals. Yet, the issue of access to green spaces is one of the crucial aspects of sustainable urban development and has got considerable attention in the global north, although relatively little is known in the global south. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the accessibility of green spaces and the factors that enhance or inhibit their accessibility in urban centers of Ethiopia in reference to the emerging towns of Oromia's special zone surrounding Finfinne. This study used network analysis, backed by interviews and observation. Results show that the average green space per capita in the towns of Sululta, Sebeta, and Legetafo is 2.66 m2, 0.9 m2, and 2.17 m2, respectively. Findings also showed that 84.7%, 64.6%, and 60.4% of the inhabitants of Sululta, Sebeta, and Legetafo, respectively, have no access to green spaces from their residences within a walking distance of 300–1000 m. The key factors that hinder its accessibility are rapid urban expansion and population growth, violation of the plan, and institutional failure. The study suggests enhancing the percentage, coverage and per capita of green spaces, controlling land-use violations, and prioritizing it as one of the key government agendas in order to achieve the eleventh goal of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.",About Sufficiency
Understanding resilience: Contributions of urban agriculture to the resilience of urban landscapes,"Urban agriculture (UA) has been explored as a nature‐based solution to address metropolises' socioecological challenges. The current study strives to determine which dimensions and components of socioecological resilience are most affected by UA in urban ecosystems. Q‐methodology was applied to identify shared discourses between experts in UA and to provide insights into how experts perceive resilience in socioecological ecosystems. The data were gathered by completing the Q table (41 statements) and interviewing experts (29 participants) in agriculture, urban planning, environmental science, urban landscape, and urban practice. The results revealed seven distinct perspectives possessed by experts with eigenvalues of 11.23, 2.37, 1.94, 1.48, 1.39, 1.25, and 1.11 and explanatory variances of 0.387, 0.08, 0.067, 0.05, 0.04, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively. The perspectives included (1) promoting a happy and healthy life, (2) integrating land use, waste, and energy management, (3) ensuring food security and protection of production resources, (4) promoting social interaction and relaxation, (5) improving biodiversity and picture quality, (6) motivating creativity for community health, and (7) reducing the ecological footprint and cost and food insecurity. Each perspective entails a different understanding of the role of UA on socioecological resilience in metropolitan areas. The results contribute to the ongoing theoretical discussion regarding the nature of the current UA in metropolises, its development, and potential conventionalization. Overall, these findings suggest a role for UA in promoting resilience in metropolises to make them socially and ecologically better places for life.",About Sufficiency
Global variation in contributions to human well-being from urban vegetation ecosystem services,"Urbanization has caused multiple environmental grand challenges that impair urban sustainability. Urban vegetation (UV), a mainstream nature-based solution (NBS), can mitigate urban challenges through providing important ecosystem services (ESs). However, successful implementation of UV to provide ESs, is impaired due to insufficient knowledge of its effectiveness under different climatic and socio-economic conditions. Here, we quantify seven ESs provided by UV across 2,148 cities with R250,000 residents. We show that UV makes substantial contributions to outdoor recreation and stormwater regulation but is less effective in reducing air pollution, in most cities, regardless of the climatic and socio-economic context. The contributions of UV to carbon sequestration, coastal protection, shade provision, and land surface temperature reduction were generally smaller and varied substantially dependent on city climatic and human development index characteristics. Comprehensive assessments for urban NBS planning are essential to maximize ES efficacy for urban sustainability improvements and support human well-being.",About Sufficiency
The “golden egg” as a natural resource: Toward a normative theory of growth management,"Growth management is the branch of urban planning concerned with the timing and sequencing of land development and the policies designed to mitigate the more negative impacts of growth. These policies are often justified on the ground that rapid or poorly planned development causes “quality of place” to deteriorate, reducing both current welfare and the prospects for future growth (i.e., “killing the goose that laid the golden egg”). In this article, I evaluate the normative assumptions underlying this popular argument. I conclude that the “golden egg” argument makes an implicit analogy to resource economics and raises legitimate issues of sustainability and dynamic efficiency. Although an understanding of resource economics can provide more normative guidance than one typically finds in the urban planning literature, using these concepts to make policy is no easy task. Thus the golden egg argument remains subject to cynical manipulation by both pro‐ and antigrowth forces. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",About Sufficiency
GRASSROOTS ECO-SOCIAL INNOVATIONS DRIVING INCLUSIVE CIRCULAR ECONOMY,"The paper discusses research results on waste governance and circular economy, conducted with waste picker cooperatives in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Two cases have been selected, from a pool of 21 waste picker organizations, to video document their grassroots eco-social innovations that have improved local waste management and the lives of the cooperative members. The videos support knowledge sharing with key actors in waste governance and the circular economy. Social grassroots innovation theory focuses on livelihood opportunities beyond the formal labour market, pursuing social inclusion by creating meaningful work for in-dividuals who were considered left out and in vulnerable situations. Transitioning to sustainability necessarily goes beyond socio-technical innovations but rather inte-grates eco-social perspectives. After first introducing grassroots innovation theory and the concept of eco-social innovations the paper describes the empirical frame and presents two cases where organized waste pickers were successful in opera-tionalizing innovations that address the circular economy and contribute to sustain -ability transitions.

Green gentrification & the luxury effect: uniting isolated ideas towards just cities for people & nature,"The growth of cities creates challenges to biodiversity and social justice. Researchers addressing these challenges often do so in silos; their efforts persistently separate justice for non-humans and humans. We analyze this separation through two concepts-luxury effect and green gentrification-that each explores urban greenspace and justice, but from different angles. The luxury effect implicitly targets justice for non-humans by exploring biodiversity in cities and finds that wealth explains the distribution of biodiversity. Green gentrification explicitly targets justice for humans by examining how new greenspaces affect people and finds that such greenspaces often displace vulnerable people. Using scientometric analyses, we show the disjunction between these concepts. We draw on socio-ecological justice concepts to suggest that disregarding relationships and conflicts among humans and non-humans in concepts does not eliminate them in practice, but stalls progress toward just cities. We urge scholars to simultaneously focus on justice for humans and non-humans.",About Sufficiency
"Green growth strategies in a shrinking city: Tackling urban revitalization through environmental justice in Kitakyushu City, Japan","Shrinking cities are places characterized by long-term population decline, property abandonment, social inequality, and environmental degradation. Urban scholarship, however, has not yet addressed the challenges of promoting social and environmental justice in shrinking cities. Focusing on Kitakyushu City, Japan, this article explores the manner in which grassroots movements can push forward environmental justice and how that can lead to policies coping with urban shrinkage and environmental degradation. Kitakyushu City was Japan's major iron and steel center during the rapid industrialization years, which culminated in severe environmental degradation. The need for environmental justice pushed grassroots movements and, in particular, women's associations to initiate different campaigns aimed at raising awareness of the city's environmental hazards and to trigger governmental response. Since then, environmental policies are driving Kitakyushu City's fight against the negative consequences that shrinkage brings about in Japanese cities. Using case study methodology and critically assessing the implemented policies, this article argues that seeking environmental justice presents an opportunity to tackle long-term decline. Hence, the article explores the theoretical implications and empirical factors behind environmental justice as the basis for a new urban revitalization model.",About Sufficiency

We use examples from various urban sustainability plans to highlight ways in which green infrastructure is being conceptualized and implemented. We explore how geography contributes research on green infrastructure as well as the emerging practices as seen within sustainability plans. We identify four areas in which geographers can influence both green infrastructure theory and practice: 1) scale; 2) mapping distribution; 3) sensitivity to place and locale; and 4) equity and access. We conclude that in these areas geographers have tremendous opportunity contribute more deliberately to sustainable urbanism.,About Sufficiency
"Stormwater Management: An Integrated Approach to Support Healthy, Livable, and Ecological Cities","The practice of stormwater management has evolved from a singular focus on drainage to a multifaceted approach to support the integrated urban development of healthy, livable, ecological, and water sensitive cities from neighborhood to metropolitan scales. A review of the knowledge base and practice by the professional stormwater management community shows attributes that favor an integrative approach to achieve co-benefits across sectors. Research into stormwater management addresses its functional areas of drainage, flood control, flood plain management, water quality control, urban ecology, recreation, and city beautification. Legacy path dependance affects the potential to reform land use practices, while stormwater management practice is affected by climate change, sea level rise, urbanization, inequality, and poor governance. This review shows a status where technical methods are well advanced but integrative frameworks to address social, ecological and infrastructure needs are more challenging. The sensitivity of ecological issues is most evident in cities in coastal zones. Organizational initiatives are needed to counter the neglect of essential maintenance and sustain flood risk reduction in cities. Stormwater management is related to other integrative tools, including IWRM, One Water, One Health, and Integrated Flood Management, as well as the broader concept of urban planning. This research review demonstrates the opportunities and needs for the advancement of an integrated approach to stormwater management to support urban development. Stormwater capture and rainfall harvesting offer major opportunities to augment scarce water supplies. Nature-based solutions like low-impact development and the sponge city concept show promise to transform cities. Major cities face challenges to sustain conveyance corridors for major flows and to store and treat combined sewer runoff. The neighborhood focus of stormwater management elevates the importance of participation and inclusion to advance environmental justice and strengthen social capital. Integrating organizational initiatives from local to city scales and funding improvements to stormwater systems are major challenges that require leadership from higher governance levels, although governments face resistance to change toward integration, especially in countries with poor land use and public works management systems. Finding solutions to neighborhood issues and the connectivity of water systems at larger scales requires complex approaches to urban planning and represent an important agenda for urban and water governance going forward.",About Sufficiency
Growing Together: Community Coalescence and the Social Dimensions of Urban Sustainability,"Urban sustainability is most often measured using a series of social, economic, and ecological indicators. Assessment methods for urban sustainability typically factor in the ecological dimensions of greenspace, such as biodiversity maintenance, stormwater management, and/or air quality-yet indicator schemas that consider only the ecological dimensions largely overlook the social benefits of some types of urban greenspace, particularly community gardens and orchards. This article makes the case that the process of community formation and strengthening that occurs in shared growing spaces is an important element of urban sustainability in its own right. Based on 55 interviews of community garden advocates, policy-makers, and development professionals involved in urban agriculture planning, this article traces the widespread understanding among practitioners that shared growing spaces strengthen social as well as environmental sustainability, though the social benefits are often difficult to measure. The latter concern was most frequently expressed by urban agriculture advocates who, after involvement in the political process, perceived the need for such metrics in order to communicate persuasively with planners and policy makers. The social values of shared growing spaces, at once self-evident to garden advocates and difficult for them to demonstrate with quantitative data, may be theorized by drawing on insights from sociology: A truly sustainable city requires community coalescence among diverse citizens, and such community is fostered particularly well in shared growing spaces.",About Sufficiency
Growth over resilience: how Canadian municipalities frame the challenge of reducing carbon emissions,"In response to anthropogenic climate change, many governments are adopting policies to reduce carbon emissions. In Canada, federal and provincial governments have implemented carbon pricing. One of the effects of putting a price on carbon is increasing the cost of using private vehicles, which may reduce mobility and increase the risk of social exclusion, especially in contexts where car dependence is high. In this article, we analyse how municipal governments in Canada frame the challenges of climate change and reducing emissions, and examine whether they link these challenges to issues of mobility and social exclusion. Focusing on policies from four of Canada's largest cities - Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Vancouver - we identify four main frames used in planning documents: ""the Growing City"", ""If You Build It, They Will Come"", ""Better City for All"", and ""the Resilient City"". The Growing City frame is used to support status quo urban development, with climate mitigation options (including sustainable travel modes) optionally included for more concerned residents. This is the dominant frame in Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg. Conversely, Vancouver uses the Resilient City frame to indicate that climate mitigation and adaption strategies are essential, and all citizens must be prepared for change. Vancouver presents changes to mobility as necessary for all, rather than an option for some. Social exclusion is not explicitly addressed in the frames, though it is presented as a reason to support building alternative transportation or more public spaces. Social exclusion receives little consideration as a potential consequence of climate mitigation policies.",About Sufficiency

Linking Spatial Characteristics of Urban Green Space and Mental Well-Being: Green Space Biodiversity and Landscape Spatial Patterns,"During the past several decades, much progress has been made in the understanding of how urban green space promotes the mental well-being of urban residents. In particular, the last two decades have witnessed a growing interest in the association between the quantity of urban green space and the effect on residents’ well-being. However, little research has attempted to disentangle the linkage between the structure of urban green space and mental well-being beyond the quantity aspect. To address this question, this dissertation includes a literature review regarding restorative mechanisms influenced by the spatial characteristics of urban green space. Also, this dissertation includes experimental and observational studies: a biodiversity study and a landscape pattern study.In the biodiversity study, I examined how the biodiversity of campus green space can promote mental well-being of college students by assessing their visual and auditory perceptions of two green spaces having either low or high biodiversity. I employed a 2 by 2 study design, in which 319 students were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: (1) low biodiversity without sound, (2) high biodiversity without sound, (3) low biodiversity with sound, and (4) high biodiversity with sound. In a controlled setting, students viewed on a computer a 360-degree-view video of either a low- or high-diversity site, with or without the natural sounds at each site, that had been recorded on the Kansas State University campus (a grassy lawn area, and a native meadow garden). The restorative status and mood of students were evaluated both pre-intervention and post-intervention via a self-reported survey. The results of this study revealed that neither biodiversity level nor sound by themselves had any significant effect on the mood or restorative status of these college students. However, a significant interaction effect between the visual and auditory perceptions was found. Students who were exposed to a high-biodiversity environment with natural sound conditions were shown to have lower levels of negative mood states compared to those without natural sound conditions.In the landscape-pattern study, I explored how landscape patterns (i.e., composition and configuration) are associated with the mental health of residents in the city of Chicago. This study used mental health and socioeconomic data from a total of 6,405 residents from 61 Chicago communities in the Healthy Chicago Survey conducted by the Chicago Department of Public Health. High-Resolution Land Cover (HRLC) data were used to calculate urban green space (e.g., trees, grass, and water). Landscape metrics were quantified to measure landscape patterns, including percentage, size, distance, and aggregation of urban green space in 61 community areas across Chicago. The results of this study showed that residents who resided in urban landscapes with small water bodies and that had greater distances between forested areas (owing to the presence of several large urban parks and forests within the Chicago study area) reported less psychological distress. As for total urban green space, there was a lower level of psychological distress in landscapes with a disaggregated distribution of urban green spaces (i.e., multiple small green spaces) in comparison with a single (or a few) large green space(s).These two studies have implications for landscape design and planning to improve the mental well-being of urban residents. Using both experimental and observational studies, this dissertation is able to contribute to a better understanding of mental restoration mechanisms provided by green spaces within urban environments on both a micro (site-based) and macro (landscape) scale. Furthermore, the study can provide insights into how landscape patterns and biodiversity affect human well-being in order to find a balance between human use and the conservation of nature.",About Sufficiency
Inequalities and Injustices of Urban Green Regeneration: Applying the Conflict Analysis Perspective,"Green regeneration has become one of the most powerful strategies for improving the quality of life in cities, supporting climate change adaptation, and reducing the carbon footprints of cities. While it is the ambition of most green regeneration projects to create benefits for residents and users, reality shows that green regeneration also reinforces existing or even shapes new ‘green inequalities’. These can result from green gentrification and displacement, procedural injustices, and exclusion from participation or barriers to the access and use of newly created urban green spaces. Set against this background, the paper uses a conflict analysis perspective to look at the inequalities and injustices that evolve within the context of green regeneration. Applying social conflict theory, it seeks to understand (1) why and how green regeneration may lead to inequality and justice conflicts and (2) how conflict analysis helps to understand the nature and implications of green regeneration conflicts in more depth.

"Life Cycle Assessment of Construction and Demolition Waste Management in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Extensive construction augmenting the infrastructure and real estate projects underpin Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 of sustainable cities. A part of this struggle involves the transformation of the existing infrastructure together with new construction, which generates a large amount of construction and demolition waste (CDW). In the absence of a structured life cycle assessment (LCA) framework, the waste management companies are planning future scenarios (phased expansions of material recovery facilities to improve the recycling rate) primarily on economic grounds. This study assesses the environmental impacts of the existing and planned CDW management practices of the Saudi Investment Recycling Company in Riyadh City by dint of LCA. Impact 2002+ performs life cycle impact assessment of the base case (45% recycling), four treatments (61, 76, 88, and 100% recycling), and zero waste scenarios. The study demonstrates the benefits of current CDW (mixed soil, concrete blocks, clay bricks, glazed tiles, and asphalt) recycling in terms of avoided impacts of non-renewable energy, global warming, carcinogens, non-carcinogens, and respiratory inorganics potentially generated by landfilling. For the treatment scenario of 100% recycling, CDW conversion into a wide range of aggregates (0–50 mm) can replace 10–100% virgin aggregates in backfilling, precast concrete manufacturing, encasements and beddings of water mains and sewers, manholes construction, non-load bearing walls, and farm-to-market roads. To achieve long-term economic and environmental sustainability, municipalities need to improve source segregation, handling, and storage practices to enhance the existing (45%) recycling rate to 100% in the next five years and approach the zero-waste scenario by 2030. The findings of the present study motivate the generators for source reduction as well as encourage the recycling companies and concerned organizations in the continuous performance improvement of the CDW management systems across Saudi Arabia on environmental grounds, as an addition to the perceived economic benefits.",About Sufficiency
"How Can Macro-Scale Land-Use Policies Be Integrated with Local-Scale Urban Growth? Exploring Trade-Offs for Sustainable Urbanization in Xi’an, China","Rapid urbanization results in farmland loss, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity decrease, and greenhouse gas emissions. Land-use policies and planning as administrative means are used to guide sustainable urban development and to balance the location of urban expansion and agricultural activities. To better understand the future implications of a variety of land-use policies, we used a FUTURES model scenario analysis to analyze the potential future patterns of urban areas and the loss and fragmentation of farmland and natural resources at the local level for Xi’an. We tested representative indicators of sustainable urbanization according to Plan 2014–2020. We found that scenarios representing the integration of several policies showed both synergetic spatial patterns and conflicting outcomes. The simulated land-use patterns of urban growth resulting from the combination of policies, were the most likely to support progress toward a livable compact city and natural resources’ conservation. These findings underscore the importance of simulation modeling and scenario analyses to quantify and visualize the results from policies and planning to support sustainable urbanization. Specifically, they show the value in simulation modeling for integrating information across scales, i.e., combining macro-level land-use policies with local-level spatial heterogeneity in socio-ecological settings, for identifying actionable planning solutions. Hence, these research results provide scientific support for land-use policy revision and implementation in Xi’an, as well as a reference point for other urbanizing cities in China.",About Sufficiency
Managing vulnerability in Sydney: Planning or providence?,"Sydney is the largest city in Oceania (the Australia - south Pacific region). During its existence of more than 200 years the city has suffered many emergencies and many psycho-social and media crises - but has escaped major disaster in the sense of deaths or economic loss. Does this indicate that disaster vulnerability has been managed well, or simply that Sydney has been fortunate? The evidence suggests that the natural environment is relatively benign. With some important exceptions, such as flooding, management has rested largely on emergency response, and on handling the residual risk through increasingly sophisticated loss redistribution mechanisms. For the more obvious ""natural"" hazards this approach has worked so far. But the approach appears to be incapable of dealing with many of the more insidious slow-onset hazards such as environmental degradation and social inequality.

MSW Management to Zero Waste: Challenges and Perspectives in Belarus,"Municipal solid waste management is one of the key challenges of environmental, economic and social importance. It is a global problem regardless of economic development level and political orientation, and also applies to a country such as Belarus. There is a lack of studies considering the local aspects of waste management in Belarus, therefore the research is actual. The study aims to formulate the recommendations on the conceptual modelling of the MSW management system in Belarus. The research methods are based on the complex systems approach. The study provides a review of the actual concepts on MSW management, including its general principles, hierarchy and methods, analysis of the current state of MSW management system in Belarus, and recommendations on modeling the MSW management system covering the local and regional aspects in Belarus. The suggestions on formulating the MSW management system involve organizational, economic, technical and informational bases as well as considering the local and regional specifics. The results indicate the following: (1) the current MSW management system in Belarus does not move the country towards a circular economy, requiring an update of the existing waste management strategy; (2) sustainable waste management demands an integrated approach in order to support waste recycling into a manufacturing resource within circular economy; (3) two main approaches to solve the problem of waste management in rural communities have been identified— an economic approach implies the minimization of waste generation while a technological approach comprises the development of mini-solutions for waste recycling at the places of waste generation. The research results contribute to the increased interest in the issue of MSW management in Belarus, and can be a useful tool for improving the planning strategies considering the local and regional context.",About Sufficiency
Ecosystem Connectivity for Livable Cities: a Connectivity Benefits Framework for Urban Planning,"Urbanization disrupts landscapes and ecosystem functions, which poses threats to biodiversity, social systems, and human health, particularly among vulnerable populations. Urban land-use planners are faced with competing demands for housing, safety, transportation, and economic development and often lack tools to integrate these with protecting environmental functions. We identify three major barriers to integrating the benefits that flow with connected, functioning ecosystems into land-use planning. The lack of a shared language among planners and stakeholders poses a barrier to the restoration and preservation of ecological features. Methods of incorporating the benefits from connectivity are not standardized because values are not readily available or lack credibility. Ecological restoration tends to be poorly coordinated at broad scales, and thus often fails to achieve landscape-level objectives. To address these challenges, we developed a novel integrated framework, the Connectivity Benefits Framework (CBF), which combines the benefits from three categories of ecosystem connectivity with benefit- and risk-relevant indicators, enabling both monetary and non-monetary valuation of benefits. Moreover, it provides a method to identify and visualize the multiple and overlapping benefits from management actions to aid in prioritizing initiatives that support ecosystem functions. Unlike software tools that incorporate generalized values of ecosystem services at a landscape level, the CBF guides a systematic approach to community-engaged land-use planning that prioritizes localized societal needs while protecting biodiversity and ecosystem function for more equitable, resilient cities. We demonstrate the potential for multiple overlapping benefits from actions that restore and protect ecosystem connectivity by applying the framework to a transit planning project in Portland, Oregon.",About Sufficiency
URBAN AGRICULTURE AS A SUSTAINABLE OPTION FOR SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT: CASE STUDY OF AN INDIAN CITY,"The rapid growth of India’s urban population coupled with food security concerns has driven urban agriculture into Indian cities. It is also commonly known that urban local bodies are struggling with the ever-increasing municipal solid waste, and in managing its segregation, transportation, and treatment. Inadequate organic waste management causes a slew of issues like gas emissions and health risks to the community. Since household wet wastes are full of nutrient-rich organic matter favorable for growing plants, urban agriculture provides an excellent opportunity of bridging the gap by reimagining waste as a resource. This study is based on the premise that decentralized urban waste management can be achieved through reusing and recycling organic waste that can benefit urban food production. It has conducted a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the organic waste usage in urban agriculture in the Indian city of Mumbai, Maharashtra. This paper presents the results of the study and examines the existing and potential capacity of urban agriculture in consuming organic urban waste in Mumbai’s context. This case study also helps in visualizing circular economy against a real-life urban scenario and how the production-consumption loop may gainfully sustain each other. Based on the learning, the paper recommends mainstreaming urban agriculture into the sustainable city framework.",About Sufficiency
"Harnessing biomass waste-to-energy for sustainable electricity generation: prospects, viability, and policy implications for low-carbon urban development","Biomass waste-to-energy (WtE) generation is a potential pathway for green urban transition in developing countries which can contribute significantly to sustainable development goal 7: affordable and clean energy. However, unlike fossil fuel energy systems, the economic returns from WtE systems are low because WtE generation is capital-intensive and requires subsidies. This study examines the prospects of a sustainable biomass electricity generation from rice husk (RH) using a large dataset of rice milling activities in a fast paced urban transition economy. The study analyzes the viability of several RH biomass electricity generation scenarios using indicators such as net electricity output, economic returns (benefits), and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results show that several mills/mill clusters generate sufficient daily RH that can power between 0.8 and 2.2 MW plant with a combined electricity output of about 500,000 MWh per annum. The economic analyses show that all RH biomass electricity generation scenarios return positive economic benefits under reduced social discount rates of 2-6%. Moreover, the LCOE of all scenarios are less than those of electricity generated from other sources. These results demonstrate that biomass waste-to-energy generation is viable for green urban development through low-carbon decentralized energy systems. Several policy implications of the findings are highlighted, including the need for policymakers and energy stakeholders to adopt sustainable biomass energy generation models such as ""design, build, and operate"" (DBO) to achieve sustainable WtE generation regimes that ensure green urban transition. Such a model will contribute to a circular economy and facilitates sustainable urban development that satisfies climate-related SDGs.",About Sufficiency

History of Water Sensitive Urban Design/Low Impact Development Adoption in Australia and Internationally,"Since the 1980s, urban planning and development has increasingly taken account of natural water and nutrient cycles, with water flows managed as would have occurred on the original greenfield site, emulating the original ecosystem. However, other drivers deriving from the impact of urban development and increased human activity include managing stormwater quality, mitigating a risk of increased flooding, especially where there had been some previous history of them in the greenfield environment, harvesting of rainwater and stormwater for potable and nonpotable use, greening the urban environment to reduce the heat island effect generated by intensive urban development and increased pavements, and improving the aesthetics of the urban environment to encourage a feeling of well-being in the community. These philosophies were developed in North America as Low Impact Development and later Green Infrastructure (which sometimes also assumes a consideration of energy management) in response to the 1972 passage of the Clean Water Act (US). Planning may incorporate green roofs, rain gardens, swales, permeable pavements, wetlands, green spaces, and urban natural vegetation corridors. Britain adopted Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) techniques. In Europe, planners and local government respond to the European Union Water Management and Flooding Directives on a river basin basis. In Australia, similar policy developments took place under the philosophy of Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD). The components and drivers vary between communities, each choosing emphases appropriate to their catchments, infrastructure, seasonal climate, local water cycle, and social expectations. Cities in East Asia have been undergoing rapid urbanization over the past 40 years, often accompanied by increased flooding, especially in China. In 2013, China introduced new urban policies which included the concept of Sponge Cities where ""stormwater can be naturally conserved, infiltrated, and purified"" for potential reuse, thereby reducing flood risks and increasing water availability. Construction guidelines were issued. Thirty major cities are participating as pilot cities. Each is eligible for central government subsidies. In Africa, the term Water-Sensitive Settlements has been suggested as the WSUD approach as originally envisaged does not take cognizance of the ""developmental"" or ""equity"" issues, which are particularly important in developing countries that may have legacies from their colonial or apartheid past. Many countries are now beginning to consider the necessity for WSUD in their cities and settlements. Addressing technical integration problems, legislative constraints, social equity, and community acceptance will be necessary for them to develop Water Sensitive Cities. This chapter summarizes the history of WSUD adoption and examples of the approach that has been taken across the globe.",About Sufficiency
How does urbanization affect the carbon intensity of human well-being? A global assessment,"While scholars have widely discussed the relationship between urbanization, economic development and environmental degradation, little is known about how urbanization affects human well-being. This paper examines the effects of urbanization on the carbon intensity of human well-being (CIWB) in 125 countries in the period of 1990-2017. The CIWB is an indicator that reflects the nexus between environmental pressure and humans living standards. According to the principle of the CIWB, our results reveal that CIWB values declined over the study period, which represents an optimistic outcome in that it indicates that human well-being increased at a faster rate than increases in per capita CO2 emissions. By employing a two-way fixed effects of Prais-Winsten regression approach, we evaluated the influence of urbanization on the CIWB in countries with various urbanization levels. Our study further selected five international cooperative organizations, each characterized by their own urbanization levels, in order to further understand whether different urbanization levels exert different impacts on the CIWB. The empirical results showed the existence of obvious differences in these effects: urbanization is shown to have prominently reduced the CIWB in countries with low and medium levels of urbanization, while it may increase the CIWB in highly urbanized countries. The empirical results obtained in relation to the cooperative organizations approximately accord with the results obtained in relation to the countries when grouped by urbanization level. The study reinforces the importance of scientific urban planning, environmental and population policies for the sustainable development of countries at different stages of urbanization.",About Sufficiency
Including Embodied Carbon in Assessing Renovation Options for Industrial Heritage Buildings: A Review and Case Studies,"Industrial buildings play vital roles in a society, from shaping the economic, technological, cultural, and social fabric of society to contributing to its growth, development, and resilience. Hence, often at the end of their lifespans, they are “preserved” for their historical value through renovation. Considerations for renovation often include their historical significance, structural integrity, adaptive reuse, social sustainability, financial viability, and environmental impacts. Among these considerations, the carbon emissions associated with a project are increasingly becoming a factor of relevance when a historical building is to be sensitively renovated so that it can continue to contribute to local sustainability. However, embodied carbon is often overshadowed by operational carbon and overlooked in the development of renovation options. This paper argues for the need to include embodied carbon in the consideration of any renovation process and for guidelines for doing so. The argument is built upon a systematic review of current practices in the renovation of industrial heritage buildings across selected representative countries from the Global South and the Global North, in the belief that the former could learn valuable lessons from the latter, which has more extensive experience in considering embodied carbon in such processes. The argument also shows the difference in policy between different countries and articulates how the inclusion of embodied carbon might support environmental targets in the Global South. Based on a quantitative comparison, this review explains why embodied carbon (EC) is missing in renovations of industrial heritage buildings in the Global South. This study estimates the proportion and value of EC within the total life cycle in renovations of industrial buildings to support the argument. Above all, a calculation using a standard life cycle assessment (LCA) tool (ISO14040 & 14044) applied to four successful examples and a quantitative comparison highlight the benefits of including embodied carbon in renovations of industrial buildings and the carbon savings in the Global South and further supports our argument.",About Sufficiency
Evaluating Urban Ecological Livability Based on the Coupling Coordination Degree Model: A Case Study of Guangzhou,"The construction of an ecologically livable city has emerged as a crucial objective in Guangzhou's “14th Five-Year Plan” and the vision for 2035. This paper establishes an evaluation index system for urban ecological livability, encompassing five dimensions: economy, society, technology, environment, and nature. It employs the TOPSIS analysis method and a coupling coordination model to conduct a trend analysis of the evaluation values and coupling coordination degrees of these five systems in Guangzhou from 2014 to 2023. The findings indicate: (1) the overall ecological livability of Guangzhou shows a positive trend, with a relatively favorable development level; however, the progress of each system is constrained by various factors. (2) Since 2015, the coupling degree of the five systems has gradually increased, maintaining a good state since 2017. The calculations of coordination degree reveal a steady rise in the overall system's coupling coordination. This study enhances the index system for ecologically livable cities and offers policy recommendations to strengthen urban ecological livability, thereby providing valuable guidance for promoting sustainable urban development and the construction of ecologically livable cities.",About Sufficiency
The socio-spatial effects of Circular Urban Systems,"This article shows what kind of urban spaces are produced by circular systems. The focus is on the socio-spatial dimension of closed material loops in two neighbourhoods (e.g., reuse of grey water, recycling of waste, provision of renewable energy). Although the Circular Economy (CE) narrative is increasingly part of urban transformation policies, there are considerable implementation gaps in how regenerative or self-sufficient systems are operationalised in practice. I argue that the application of circularity principles in the urban context requires conceptual clarification to be useful for urban theory and praxis. Therefore, I provide a political ecology perspective of circular urban systems by analysing two cases: Block 6 in Berlin and Schoonschip in Amsterdam. I explain how such systems were established, who benefits from them, and what kind of socio-spatial conditions they produce. Methodologically, I use several qualitative research methods in the framework of a case study analysis. The results show that the incremental and publicly financed low-tech development of circular systems is socially compatible while privately funded high-tech developments result in stronger levels of sustainability but are reserved to a small exclusive group of people and provoke gentrification processes.",About Sufficiency

"Impacts of urbanization on ecosystem services and their temporal relations: A case study in Northern Ningxia, China","Urbanization, an unavoidable global process, has driven land use change, impacted ecosystem services, and induced serious environmental problems. As a result, urban planning is a critical issue in sustainable development. In this study, we developed a framework to quantify how urbanization influences ecosystem services (ESs) in order to provide suggestions for urban planning during large scale urban agglomeration in northwestern China. We separated the region into three sub-regions (developed urban, developing urban, and rural areas), quantified five critical ESs (crop production, carbon storage, nutrient retention, sand fixation, and habitat quality), analyzed the relationships (trade-off, synergy, and bundle) among ES changes, and investigated the impacts of urbanization on these ESs. The results show that urbanization results in large scale reclamation and small scale deforestation in rural areas; it comprehensively results in an increase of four ESs (not habitat quality). Urban expansion mainly occurs in developing urban areas and causes a decrease in four ESs (not sand fixation). Based on temporal change in ESs, synergy relationships exist among them, except for between nutrient retention and crop production, which have an insignificant correlation. Urban expansion would strengthen the synergy relationships among regulating services, while green infrastructure in core urban areas would weaken these relationships. Based on the spatial distribution of ES change, two bundles were identified among the five ESs: 1) crop production, carbon storage, and nutrient retention; and 2) sand fixation and habitat quality. Based on these findings, several suggestions for urban expansion and land use planning are proposed to achieve an optimized balance between urbanization and ES protection. Investigating the impacts of rapid urbanization on ESs and their relationships could provide scientifically based suggestions for urban planning according to ES protection, sustainable urban development, and human well-being.",About Sufficiency
Incentivizing secondary raw material markets for sustainable waste management,"Notwithstanding several policy initiatives in many countries over a number of years, there remains a general sense that too much municipal solid waste is generated and that too much of the waste that is generated is landfilled. There is an emerging consensus that a sustainable approach to waste management requires further development of secondary raw material markets. The purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical economic model that focuses upon this stage of a sustainable waste management program and explores policy options that could motivate efficiency in secondary raw material markets. In particular, we show how firm profit and social welfare optimizing objectives can be reconciled in a two-product market of waste management processes: landfilling and material reclamation. Our results provide theoretical support for building out recent Circular Economy initiatives as well as for the relatively recent emergence of landfill mining as a means for procuring secondary raw materials.

Influences and pathways of urban form and lifestyle on carbon emission reduction,"Urban areas experience high carbon emissions, impeding sustainable development, and causing global environmental changes. Low-carbon planning and lifestyle have the co-benefit of reducing carbon emissions and mediating environmental threats. However, the relationship among carbon emissions, urban form, and lifestyle remains unclear, limiting low-carbon urban and societal development. Thus, the objective of this study was to simultaneously clarify the direct and indirect influences and pathways of lifestyle (i.e., expenditures on diet, housing, transport, and entertainment) and urban form characteristics (i.e., dispersion, patch area, fragmentation, and aggregation of building patches) on carbon emissions, and identify vital factors for mitigating carbon emissions. Moreover, a partial least squares model was established and analyzed using urban-scale data from 352 townships in Taiwan, which was used at novel spatial scales. The empirical results demonstrate that maximizing the building patch area and minimizing the dispersion, fragmentation, and aggregation of building patches can reduce carbon emissions. Furthermore, minimizing expenditures on diet, housing, transport, and entertainment would have a similar effect. The findings established that proper policies for lifestyle and urban form can reduce carbon emissions and serve as useful strategies for developing low-carbon societies and cities.",About Sufficiency

Integrating Social Equity into Multiobjective Optimization of Urban Stormwater Low-Impact Development,"Recent studies have demonstrated some advantages of using advanced heuristic algorithms to identify near-Pareto-optimal future locations, types, and sizes for stormwater low-impact development and green infrastructure (LID/GI) across a given urban landscape. However, previous optimization studies did not consider social equity as an objective, which poses problems because urban green infrastructure often is distributed inequitably. Increasing access to LID/GI in historically marginalized areas is a prominent environmental justice issue, and increasingly is becoming a primary consideration when prioritizing future locations, types, and sizes of urban LID/GI. This study integrated a novel spatial social equity objective [LID/GI-Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) correlation objective, ?] into a multiobjective LID/GI optimization model. The LID/GI-SVI correlation is an objective that directs the optimization algorithm to search for LID/GI distributions that maximize the linear correlation between LID/GI implementation and subbasins with higher estimated percentages of historically marginalized people. Our analysis focused on understanding the impacts of the LID/GI-SVI correlation objective on a LID/GI optimization model. This modeling study demonstrates that (1) the LID/GI-SVI correlation objective can be used to direct optimization algorithms to search for LID/GI distributions that can achieve runoff management objectives, increase green LID/GI implementation in more marginalized areas, and explore the potential trade-offs or synergies between hydrologic and equity goals; (2) LID/GI optimization formulations that consider only hydrologic objectives likely will not result in equitable LID/GI distributions; (3) LID/GI distributions that perform well on the LID/GI-SVI correlation may be composed of different types of LID/GI than less-equitable but more hydrologically favorable LID/GI distributions; and (4) for our study area, including spatial equity as an objective resulted in modest reductions in the hydrologic performance of near-Pareto-optimal LID/GI distributions.",About Sufficiency
Introduction of the circular economy within developing regions: A comparative analysis of advantages and opportunities for waste valorization,"The introduction of effective solid waste management strategies in developing countries should be considered for improving sustainability at global level. Many barriers should be overcome, concerning the introduction of environmental policies, effective investments, social inclusion and public awareness, which are significant issues in low-middle income countries. The Circular Economy could represent the answer for improving current solid waste management activities worldwide, since denote the principle of waste valorization and recycling for boosting developing economies. This paper is focused on this theme, analyzing main opportunities for improving the current state of solid waste management in developing big cities. The solid waste management of two countries are reviewed: Romania is the emerging country where Circular Economy is becoming a future objective due to economic aids and strength regulations which the European Union (EU) established for the nations forming parts the alliance; as a comparison, Bolivia is reported for evaluating main differences founded for developing recycling systems in a no-EU country. These two case studies could be of interest for highlighting main pros and cons of the participation into a wide organization like the EU for introducing in short terms Circular Economy principles. Moreover, a theoretical Circular Economy model for developing big cities in low-middle income countries is described within the study for effectively comparing which chances can spread for these countries as regard municipal solid waste exploitation. Despite the economic level, Romania and Bolivia are both facing with many solid waste management issues although in different magnitude. For the Romanian case study, it is visible how it cannot achieve the European goals for 2020 due the need of change in public recycling behavior. Bolivia, instead, represents the case where international aids and new investments are required, considering the informal sector into the formal management system as a real opportunity for improving local recycling rate. In conclusion, the comparison suggests how external supports led to implement the principles of the Circular Economy within a developing region.

Waste as Resource for Pakistan: An Innovative Business Model of Regenerative Circular Economy to Integrate Municipal Solid Waste Management Sector,"Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a global concern, especially in low–middle-income countries such as Pakistan, which require the redressal of MSW treatment issues to attain sustainability in the waste sector. The prosperity of municipal solid waste (MSW) collectors, i.e., the sanitary workers, is critical in the waste management hierarchy. Hence, the health, safety, social welfare, economic conditions and overall wellbeing of this tier need to be focused on more. Safeguarding the interests of the sanitary workers will support the MSW management sector in sustainability, which will help to generate revenue and minimize climatic impacts.

"ECOLOGICAL URBANISM, URBAN ECONOMY AND POLICIES FOR BUILDING SUSTAINABLE CITIES OF THE FUTURE","With this article, the author will try to outline the relationship between environmental urbanism, the urban economy and policies to build sustainable cities of the future. Given that worldwide attention is being paid to the problems of climate change, which go hand in hand with the creation of sustainable architecture, which uses green technologies to build a modern city, where the application of the environmental approach is seen as a means of healing and planning the modern city of the future. The emerging trend of increasing population in economically active centers worldwide determines the development of the entire economy of each country, including Bulgaria. And so in the formed, economically active centers many interesting processes take place, determining the rhythm of the economic everyday life of a huge part of the city's population, which requires a detailed analysis justifying the process of forming policies for building sustainable cities of the future. It is for the creation of sustainable cities of the future that it is necessary to implement spatial strategic planning, which should include the basic concepts and concepts based on ecological urbanism, green and circular economy in order to overcome the chaos in urban development, especially in Eastern Europe. For example, the chaotic development of tourism in the Burgas region creates the emergence of unsolvable problems, despite the fact that there has been an increase in visits. Creating the right infrastructure must be seen as one of the most important prerequisites for attracting strategic investors. On the other hand, we should not ignore the fact that in a number of sectors there is a shortage of staff, who are expelled from small settlements by low pay, from lack of economic opportunities for realization on the labor market. As well as the slow pace with which small settlements are developing and local problems are being solved, which require active and thinking local government. Urbanization in Europe is a growing phenomenon, both in terms of increasing urban space and in terms of the growing share of the population. Urban growth has different dimensions, in every country in the world, and the line between urban and rural areas is increasingly blurred. Especially given that in recent years there has been a tendency to significantly increase the share of suburban areas compared to the level of development of traditional central urban areas. This process implies to pay additional attention on the one hand to the process of developing new strategies and tools for planning and forecasting for the development and creation of sustainable links between rural and urban land use, and on the other hand to look for opportunities to meet modern challenges for the protection of the environment and the building of sustainable cities of the future. A number of cities in the country and the world face various challenges related to social, economic and environmental problems arising from the increasing importance of factors - overcrowding, social inequality, pollution, increased traffic, etc. Therefore, one of the main challenges to the development of modern sustainable cities of the future, on the one hand is to achieve a balance between population density and compactness of cities, and on the other hand to improve the quality of life in building and maintaining a healthy urban environment. Significant attention must be paid to the process of integrating policies at national, regional and local levels in the application of new forms of urban planning and management to reap the full benefits of urbanization.",About Sufficiency

By emphasizing the refinery’s connection to Santa Cruz de Tenerife and its metropolitan area, as well as its coastal interface, this study proposes a comprehensive methodology to assess the territorial impacts of urban processes and guide project decisions toward enhancing the quality of life for the region’s residents.",About Sufficiency
Justice in nature-based solutions: Research and pathways,"Nature-based solutions are quickly rising to the top of the sustainable urban development agenda as an ecosystem-based approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change, while also improving livelihoods and biodiversity. Achieving sustainability and resilience through nature-based solutions is an important means for cities and communities across the globe to take climate action and experiment with new forms governance, infrastructure, and planning and design. In this paper, I map the academic research structure of nature-based solutions and find that issues of social and environmental justice remain peripheral. To center justice in research and practice, I argue for a re-orientation towards just nature-based solutions-approaches that utilize the power of nature and people to transform the social, political, and economic drivers of socio-spatial inequality and environmental degradation into opportunities to create progressive, cohesive, antiracist, and social-ecologically sustainable communities. Based on the findings of the literature review and bibliometric analysis, I propose three pathways for just nature-based solutions: (1) race and class; (2) transformative co-production; and (3) value articulations. These starting points link to current principles in nature-based solutions and help bring clarity for scholars, activists, and planners on how to critically engage with the politics of environmental governance and decision-making.",About Sufficiency
"Comparisons of stakeholders' influences, inter-relationships, and obstacles for circular economy implementation on existing building sectors","Buildings are energy- and resource-hungry: their construction and use account for around 39% of global carbon dioxide emissions; they consume around 40% of all the energy produced; they are responsible for over 35% of the EU's total waste generation; and account for about 50% of all extracted (fossil) materials. Therefore, they present a significant challenge to meeting national and international Net Zero targets of reducing greenhouse emissions and fossil resource use. The CircularB Project, is at the heart of this issue, which will underpin synergies of multi-scale circular perspectives (from materials, to components, to assets and built environments), digital transformation solutions, data-driven and complexity science, stakeholder behavioral science, and interdisciplinary capabilities towards achievable, affordable and marketable circular solutions for both new and existing buildings, for sustainable urban design, and for circular built environments across Europe. This paper contributes to the project by deriving new insights into the stakeholders’ influences, inter-relationships, and obstacles in the implementation of circular economy concepts on existing building stocks in Europe, which represent over 90% of whole building assets. In order to identify and derive the insights, our study is rigorously based on (i) a robust critical literature review of key documentations such as articles, standards, policy reports, strategic roadmaps and white papers; and (ii) interviews with relevant stakeholders and decision makers. Uniquely, our work spans across all scales of CE implementation from materials, to products and components, to existing building stocks, and to living built environments. The findings point out the current challenges and obstacles required to be tackled. Inadequacies of financial incentives and governmental enforcement (via policy, legislation, or directive) are commonly found to be the most critical obstacles found throughout Europe. Circular economy is the global challenge and not just a single country can resolve the climate issue without the cooperation of other countries. The insights thus highlight the essential need for harmonized actions and tactical/pragmatic policies promoted and regulated by the European Commission, national and local governments who can dominate the influence, promote inter-relationship, and overcome the barriers towards circular economy much more effectively.",About Sufficiency
"Evaluating the challenges and impacts of mixed-use neighborhoods on urban planning: an empirical study of a megacity, Karachi, Pakistan","IntroductionModern development is patented by rapid urbanization, which largely negatively affects the quality of life. Over the past few decades in the World; in the field of urban planning and the real estate market, Mixed-use development has become a Centre of attention. Karachi is the mega city with the highest population in Pakistan. Gulshan-e Iqbal is considered an upper to upper-middle-class income group residential place where mostly vertical development is observed. Soon the area gets popular for living, and road-facing flats started to engage in Residential cum commercial activities i.e., mixed-used development problems (traffic jams, people's regular mobility, etc.) for residents arose and as the area got crowded day by day these problems became more critical. The present research aimed to examine the land-use type, and its distribution in the area of Gulshan-e-Iqbal I, and investigate the causes of the failure of Mixed-Use Neighborhood development and to prove the problem environmental impact assessment of the area have also been done.Materials and methodsObject-based analyses have been conducted on a very high-resolution image of the SAS planet, Digitization has been done on the image later classified into 14 major classes. After attempting the strategic objective identification of issues causing Mobility, an inductive approach (Resident Survey) to analyze the resident perception and to validate issues raised due to mixed-use development, Environmental Impact Analysis has been done. Air Quality of study area has been done, in this regard PM 10 ppm, PM 1 ppm, PM 2.5, CO, CO2, and TVOC have been conducted for different timings. Wind Velocity has also been recorded for the same locations.Results and discussionIt has been investigated that mixed-use development is spread over the entire area by different ratios i.e., 7.3% by functional land-use, 24% of mixed-use development occupied 24% of total land-use in the area. From public perception, it is concluded that most people have their cars even more than two, and 66.7% park their cars on the streets rather than inside their premises. PM10 ppm values are higher along major roads and expressways and mixed-use development zones. PM2.5 reading is higher (249–267 ppm) at the mixed-use development. The overall Gulshan e Iqbal 1 is under the influence of PM1 pollution i.e., ranged from 153 to 248 ppm. The maximum emission (67–73 ppm) of Carbon monoxide is found at ATMs. The vast spread of CO2 in the atmosphere but along the main roads and interjections i.e., 342 ppm while the highest reading reached up to 800. TVOC is commonly found in congested places where there is more transport in limited areas. Wind velocity is found where the built-up structure is compact wind velocity is ultimately low but the concentration of pollution is higher.Conclusions and recommendationsThis study will be helpful to plan a suitable planning strategy to reduce the daily havoc generated by the constant flux of traffic, for urban development and sustainability.",About Sufficiency
Multifunctional Role of Land-Use Planning in Peri-Urban and Urban Agricultural Drylands: The Mediating Effect of Urbanization Level,"The phenomenon of rapid urbanization indeed presents a complex array of challenges for land-use planning, especially in the context of agricultural drylands transitioning into peri-urban and urban lands. Urbanization trends in 2020 reached about 60%, with projections indicating that urbanization will increase to about 70% by 2030. The transformation from rural to urban characteristics affects not only the physical agricultural drylands but also the socioeconomic and ecological dynamics of the region. The shift from rural to increasingly urban characteristics brings about multifaceted challenges and opportunities for land-use planning, and multifunctional landscape shows a wide diversity of ecosystem functions, which is generally ensured by landscape biodiversity. The aims and objectives of the study were to promote sustainable development, enhance food security, support urban resilience, protect agricultural land, integrate peri-urban and urban systems, promote efficient land usage, and ensure environmental safety. Here, we incorporated primary data obtained using a close-ended survey questionnaire through a nonprobability convenience sampling technique. The sample size of the study comprised 680 participants, and we employed a structural equation model in two steps for analytical purposes: confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis. The findings revealed that amenity, landscape and recreational value, and proximity significantly affect peri-urban areas and urban agricultural drylands (B = 0.204, p-value = 0.00 < 0.05; B = 0.204, p-value = 0.00 < 0.05; B = 0.124, p-value = 0.051 < 0.01; B = 0.28, p-value = 0.00 < 0.01; B = 0.445, p-value = 0.00 < 0.01; B = 0.197, p-value = 0.00 < 0.01). The existing large rural lots in China's Tianjin region were found to negatively affect the level of urbanization (B = −0.25, p-value = 0.00 < 0.01) and urban agricultural dryland (B = −0.256, p-value = 0.00 < 0.01). A mediating effect of the level of urbanization was also found (B = 0.045, p-value = 0.01 < 0.05; B = 0.026, p-value = 0.041 < 0.05; B = −0.032, p-value = 0.03 < 0.05; B = 0.128, p-value = 0.02 < 0.05). We conclude that amenity, landscape and recreational value, and proximity significantly influence peri-urban areas and agricultural drylands. This study enlightened the urban professional planners, which includes urban designers, landscape designers, and architects, along with Chinese social planners, although no mediating effect on the level of urbanization was observed between land-use planning and peri-urban areas. Land-use planning in peri-urban and urban agricultural drylands should be multifunctional, integrating urban food systems into urban planning, promoting sustainable land management, and considering the mediating effects of urbanization levels to enhance urban resilience and sustainability. The limitation of the study outlined the impact of peri-urban agriculture within the context of the Tianjin region of China. Therefore, the outcome of the current study may not apply to other regions. As such, we recommend repeating the current study in regions other than China of developed and developing countries.",About Sufficiency
Evaluating equity and justice in low-carbon energy transitions,"A low-carbon energy transition is essential for mitigating climate change, but can also cause energy justice and equity impacts on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), low-income, and other frontline communities. Examples include exacerbating energy burden, inaccessibility and unaffordability of low-carbon energy and electric end-use technologies, property value loss and displacement from renewable energy siting, and unequal health benefits and employment losses from fossil fuel retirement. To avoid perpetuating historical and creating new injustices, an equitable and just energy transition will require careful planning and execution. To this end, measuring and evaluating the effects of existing and proposed programs and policies aimed at decarbonizing energy systems is critical. However, methods and metrics for evaluating equity effects vary across disciplines and transitions, making it challenging to identify effective evaluation strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the equity implications of low-carbon energy transitions and identifies key metrics that have been used across disciplines to quantify energy injustices and equity impacts. We focus on four key low-carbon energy transitions: (1) renewable energy deployment; (2) fossil fuel infrastructure retirement; (3) transportation electrification; and (4) residential building decarbonization. We classify energy justice and equity metrics into the dimensions of health, access, and livelihood, and construct an analytical framework that supports policymakers, planners and other stakeholders in identifying important equity considerations and quantitatively evaluating the effects of decarbonization initiatives. While our framework can serve as a starting point for evaluating justice and equity impacts of energy transitions, further work is needed to address the limitations of existing metrics and additional evaluation methods will be critical to effect energy transitions that are truly equitable.",About Sufficiency
Do plans matter? A game-theoretic model for examining the logic and effects of land use planning,"Although state and local growth management programs vary widely, nearly all such programs include one common feature: they require local governments to plan. While there has been extensive research on the effects of growth management in general and on specific policy instruments to manage urban growth there has been little research on the effects of planning. In this paper we present a game-theoretic model of urban development in which a rational local government plans. The model illustrates how planning can serve to guide local government decision making, how land market participants might respond to local government plans, and how planning in a dynamic context can increase social welfare. By considering local government as a player who plans rather than as an external disturbance that might regulate, we can discover insights and frame hypotheses about the efficacy of planning that are not possible in other urban economic models.",About Sufficiency
Operationalising energy sufficiency for low-carbon built environments in urbanising India,"India’s urbanisation is considered the largest national urban transformation of the 21st century, with its trajectory having a decisive impact on carbon emissions globally. This study defines and operationalises the concept of energy sufficiency for the growth of Indian cities which is expected to be largely driven by low- and middle-income housing. It combines theoretical framing with quantitative assessment of test models to present an operational framework of energy sufficiency that can be implemented through urban planning regulations. Based on the global budgetary limit to restrict global warming to 1.5°C, a precautionary target of 1.0 tCO2 per capita per year is estimated as an energy sufficiency allowance for upcoming residential built environments. By optimising the average dwelling size, limiting the land-use intensity to low-rise (four storeys) and compact urban forms, and improving operational energy performance with adaptive thermal comfort, the carbon emissions from residential buildings can be sufficiently optimised to 0.84 tCO2 per capita per year. The integration of rooftop renewable energy can further reduce it to 0.56 tCO2. The co-benefits of the optimised costs of construction and operation make the case for economic feasibility and wider affordability.Policy relevanceThe rapid urbanisation in India will significantly increase carbon emissions from the urban built environment. Current trends towards high-rise and high-density residential development contribute significantly to the demand for embodied and operational energy. However, these remain unaccounted for in India’s action plan to meet its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to reduce emissions intensity. Energy sufficiency can be used as a guiding principle for urbanising contexts to limit both the embodied energy of new residential buildings and the associated operational energy demands. The proposed framework for sufficiency serves as a useful policy instrument, capable of being translated to actionable urban planning regulations. By demonstrating the potential of a ‘sufficient’ per capita carbon emissions budget for the growth and regeneration of residential buildings, this framework equips planners to set limits for the height and density of the built environment, fostering a low-carbon future aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",About Sufficiency
Land Stewardship and Development Behaviors Under an Ecological-Impact-Weighted Land Value Tax Scheme: A Proof-of-Concept Agent-Based Model,"Sprawling land development patterns have exacerbated ecological degradation, social fragmentation, and public health problems. Perverse incentives arise from the ability to privatize collectively created value in land rents and socialize ecological costs. Land value taxation (LVT) has been shown to encourage urban infill development by reducing or eliminating rent-seeking behavior in land markets. However, despite its purported benefits, this tax reform is value monistic in its definition of optimal land use and, therefore, does little to address the lack of non-market information to inform land use decisions. We propose an ecological-impact-weighted land value taxation policy (ELVT) which incorporates the ecological footprint of land use into one's land value tax burden. We test both proposed policies (LVT and ELVT) relative to a ""status quo"" (SQ) property tax scheme, utilizing a conceptual spatially explicit agent-based model of land use behaviors and housing development. Our findings suggest that both tax interventions can increase the capital intensity and decrease the land intensity of housing development. Furthermore, both tax interventions can lead to a net profit loss for speculators and a decrease in the average housing unit price. The ELVT scheme is shown to significantly increase urban nature provisions and dampen the loss of ecological value across a region.",About Sufficiency

In Rome, the reuse of construction materials was considered legitimate due to its economic and architectural significance, prioritizing restoration over new construction and regulating reuse to prevent urban degradation. Likewise, there was a market for second-hand materials, tied to speculation from deliberate demolitions, and a functional approach to recycling for public works. Although waste was not prioritized as it is under the Circular Economy framework of Spain's Law 7/2022 on Waste and Contaminated Land, Roman practices foreshadowed embryonic forms of circular economy, emphasizing efficiency in debris management and material transportation. These precedents reflect principles that have influenced the shaping of modern environmental administrative law, aimed at mitigating urban ecological impacts and fostering resilience.",About Sufficiency

This case study of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, shows that the presence of green and sustainable city discourses in policymaking does not reflect the reality of urban planning practices. Instead, it has produced an urban vision reflective of the priorities of global capital while contributing to the ongoing destruction of urban biodiversity and the marginalization of urban residents living in poverty.

"Leveraging environmental assessment and environmental justice to deliver equitable, decarbonized built infrastructure","Climate change is the most pressing sustainability issue of our time, with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions causing economic, environmental, and human health impacts. We need to achieve net-zero civil infrastructure systems to limit global temperature increases. Energy production and supply, transportation, buildings, and industry are examples of civil infrastructure systems. Examining the full scope of impacts throughout the conception, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of infrastructure systems will allow for improved mitigation and adaptation planning. Current planning processes and mechanisms will need to be transformed to achieve 'climate-smart' infrastructure that focus on thoughtful minimization of impacts, cooperation with communities, and understanding the implications of failing to act. Social equity is often left as an afterthought in environmentally conscious infrastructure planning. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is the most complete and decision-powerful model for cataloging environmental impacts of a system. However, the methodology has limitations regarding how it might be leveraged to support multicriteria decision-making in decarbonizing our civil infrastructure systems, such as when trying to account for community preferences, an important element of a just transition. Future planning for the decarbonization of our built environment would benefit from a multi-criteria approach that encompasses elements of LCA, equity, and stakeholder collaboration, the latter two of which are key tenets for advancing environmental justice.",About Sufficiency
Leveraging nature for just cities: Planning nature-based solutions in Greece,"An unequal distribution of green areas across cities coupled with the vulnerability towards climate change and global warming is causing segregation between residents who profit from nature-based solutions'(NbS) health and wellbeing benefits and those who do not. Residential segregation in urban settings goes far beyond income and socio-economic factors and is also evident in questions of environmental justice, participation and power - including how and where NbS are implemented. Delving into Greek cities, this paper raises the question of whether and how engagement with urban NbS differs within cities and among their residents. By applying a survey with an integrated discrete choice experiment (N = 1002) we were able to analyze the relevance of the type of green area, the effectiveness in temperature and microdust reduction, biodiversity enhancement, time and financial payments and the importance of participatory planning processes. The latent class analysis showed that urban segregation is recognizable within the sample. By investigating the differences in ability and willingness to support urban NbS, this paper recommends how green infrastructure can be implemented in a manner which enforces a more just distribution for those who need it most.",About Sufficiency
"Environmental deterioration in rapid urbanisation: evidence from assessment of ecosystem service value in Wujiang, Suzhou","Land use change is the most prominent feature of Chinese urbanisation. In China, the expansion of land consumed for urban development is inevitable given the rapid increases in the urban economy and urban population, but also in meeting the population’s increasing demand for better quality of life. This paper is based on a research study of Wujiang district in Suzhou, which is considered representative of many of the rapid urbanisation areas within the nation. The objective is to develop an in-depth understanding of the characteristics of land use change and how this change contributes to environmental deterioration, as assessed by changes in the ecosystem service value (ESV). In this study, ESV is defined as the environmental products and functions provided for human well-being. Based on local planning documents, Landsat TM remote-sensing images and field surveys, the research analyses the cost to the environment when traditional land uses are transformed into urbanisation. The research demonstrates that conversion to urban land use which ignores the limit and capacity of the environment can generate significant environmental costs, as assessed by ESV, which in turn, can lead to a deterioration of quality of life for inhabitants, the exact opposite of the original intention. The research demonstrates that by mapping the spatial distribution of ecological service values, ESV can be used as a guide to urban sustainable development.",About Sufficiency
Life cycle economic and social sustainability aspects of prefabricated construction - a systematic review towards the holistic sustainability,"Purpose This study aims to investigate the state-of-the-art in economic sustainability (EcS) and social sustainability (ScS) of prefabricated construction (PFC), addressing gaps in holistic life cycle perspectives. Design/methodology/approach A bibliometric analysis and a content-based critical review were used to synthesise literature on EcS and ScS of PFC. Findings Results reveal that life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), social life cycle assessment and additive manufacturing are emerging themes. EcS is more extensively researched than ScS, with developed regions dominating case studies. While PFC marginally outperforms conventional methods in most EcS and ScS evaluations, critical gaps persist in indicator diversity, stakeholder representation and data availability. Challenges related to methodological immaturity and data availability are discussed in depth, leading to an improvement strategy framework proposal. The discussion emphasises how holistic sustainability assessments, circular economy (CE) principles and alignment with sustainable development goals (SDGs) can position PFC as a driver for sustainable urban development. A future research agenda should prioritise methodological advancements, case-specific studies (e.g. CE), LCSA and SDG-aligned policies and decision support systems to enhance sustainability decision-making in PFC. Originality/value Although environmental sustainability in PFC is well-examined, economic and social dimensions remain underexplored.

Linking equitable redevelopment to reduced damages from metropolitan sprawl,"New business, real estate and public investment dollars are skewed towards the predominantly white outlying suburbs, which fuels metropolitan sprawl, development of green spaces, and loss of farms. Many U.S. centre-cities are relegated to a preponderance of abandoned and potentially contaminated properties or brownfields. This unequal outward expansion is caused, in part, by unfair zoning and real estate practices that result in decreased development choices and increased social and economic inequality. Under-utilization of existing infrastructure potentially results in hundreds of billions of :dollars in inefficiencies due to added costs and under-utilized capital. Exclusionary zoning, often based on minimum lot size requirements per household or exclusions of multifamily or accessory housing units, results in non market limits to affordable housing. Unlike Europe's transit oriented developments, dispersed development in the U.S. increases automobile reliance and associated mobile source pollutants. Smart growth policies and brownfield redevelopment in the U.S. can help redress one-sided investment practices that have directed development and jobs away from older and poorer communities. However, market processes are distorted to under-price sprawling greenfield development, leading to sub-optimal land consumption and allocation of resources affecting the environment, community and regional economies, whilst exacerbating social-economic inequalities. More equitable urban redevelopment efforts can strengthen existing communities while promoting improved regional environmental performance along with fiscal and economic benefits.",About Sufficiency

Long-term implications of electric vehicle penetration in urban decarbonization scenarios: An integrated land use?transport?energy model,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered a promising technology and an attractive solution for a low-carbon future. It is therefore necessary to model the market penetration of EVs and determine the role of EV adoption in future urban decarbonization scenarios. This study developed an integrated land use?transport?energy model to examine interactions between location choice, land use, transport patterns, energy profiles, and economy when implementing a stringent EV policy. Two scenarios were structured to investigate the long-term (to 2050) impacts of EV adoption on population distribution, land use patterns, transport demand, energy mix, emission profiles, and social welfare. Scenario simulations showed that ambitious market diffusion of EVs is likely to have significant positive effects on emission reduction in city centers, while economic benefits tend to occur in suburban areas, implying that EV adoption will play an important role in the spatial organization and structure of cities. The spatial heterogeneity of different urban zones requires more attention when evaluating the effectiveness of sustainable urban policies. Because disaggregated spatial interactions can be handled by the new integrated model, the methodology proposed here will be a useful tool for sustainable urban planning.",About Sufficiency
Low-carbon city communication: Integrated strategies for urban and rural municipalities in Thailand,"As an important sustainable development goal, the creation of low-carbon cities (LCCs) has become crucial to creating livable cities and environmental sustainability. Thus, we aimed to understand the factors that support the transition of traditional cities to LCCs, by analyzing and synthesizing how to promote practical LCC across 15 pilot municipalities in four regions of Thailand, covering four strategies: City of Trees, City of Waste Minimization, City of Energy Efficiency, and City of Sustainable Consumption. Literature research, in-depth interviews, and observations were employed for data collection, while the 5 W (who, says what, in which channel, to whom, and with what effect) and SMCR (sender, message, channel, and receiver) models were used to create a communication analysis framework.

Making compost and establishing waste recycling banks are recommended for rural municipalities, while optimization of garbage and wastewater management systems and facilities should be highlighted in urban municipalities. Moreover, recycling, low-carbon agriculture, second-hand shops/markets, green markets, and homegrown vegetables should be encouraged for sustainable consumption. Working with local municipalities, credible leaders and representatives were the key senders. Additionally, message design should compare the pros and cons of behaviors, connect with local health and tourism, and promote dialogue in easy-to-understand and thought-provoking language.

"Low-carbon retrofits in social housing: Energy efficiency, multidimensional energy poverty, and domestic comfort strategies in southern Europe","Social housing providers have a significant amount of influence over large housing stocks, which gives them unique opportunities to address both energy efficiency and social inclusion. However, there are significant barriers to achieving these goals in southern European contexts, where obsolete housing stocks and widespread energy poverty situations combine to create a ""prebound effect"", whereby residents consume less energy than in projections of standardised patterns, thus invalidating models based on energy efficiency gains and energy production. This paper uses empirical findings from interviews with social housing providers in the metropolitan areas of Porto [Portugal] and Barcelona [Spain] to understand how this contradiction is being handled in the sector, and compares the findings with surveys of the nature and depth of energy poverty situations in a broadly defined social housing sector. Our results show that social housing providers tend to favour strategies based on retrofitting the envelopes of the buildings, and to resist installing renewable energy equipment, for which cost recoupment is near-unachievable. We argue that this focus on achieving thermal comfort by passive measures overlooks the multidimensionality of energy poverty situations in the social housing sector, with widespread practices of restrictions on cooking, lighting and DHW uses.",About Sufficiency
Low-carbon urban experiments from vision to reality: a systematic review of the literature from 2005 to 2020,"In recent decades, many cities have launched low-carbon pilot schemes to explore feasible local policies and actions that can be replicated on a larger scale to reduce the intensity of carbon emissions. This synthesis analysis reviews the global literature to analyse the interplay of prescriptive visions, practical responses, and evaluation methods of low-carbon urban experiments. Before 2015, low-carbon urban experiments were regarded as a sub-branch of sustainable development, and prescriptive visions were influenced by sustainability. Low-carbon urban experiments were used as an urban planning tool, and such urban planning concepts impacted the practical response and evaluation methods. After 2015, low-carbon urban experiments were influenced by many more disciplines. Planning still occupies the largest proportion of low-carbon practices, but more advanced technologies - in energy and other fields - have also been adopted and influence the evolution of low-carbon urban experiments. We find several driving factors, including political events and developments, technology change, and contributions from various disciplines including academic research. As carbon neutrality is the long-term target of many nations, achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions through prescriptive visions, practical responses, and evaluation methods in urban experiments demands further investigation, especially in developing countries.Key policy insightsLow-carbon initiatives on a small scale are frequently practiced by local and national governments, which has reshaped the low-carbon agenda worldwide.Low-carbon development also demands efforts and commitment on the part of local urban governments to promote low-carbon development in its multiple dimensions.Policymakers at different levels of government and governance should focus on how to build on policy instruments in experimental pilots to take action at broader scales.Policymakers also need to adopt relevant indicators from social science in evaluation methods to reflect social sustainability and inclusiveness concerns in the evaluation of low-carbon urban development.",About Sufficiency
Low-carbon urban-rural modern energy systems with energy resilience under climate change and extreme events in China-A state-of-the-art review,"Climate-adaptive energy resilience and low-carbon transformation are mainstreams to combat with climate change uncertainty, rural energy poverty, and urban modern energy systems. However, effective strategies have not been provided for energy resilience enhancement considering centralized and decentralized system transition, climate change, extreme weather, natural disasters, equipment failure. In this study, urban and rural energy systems are comprehensively reviewed and compared for low-carbon and sustainability transformation, in terms of energy structures, raw energy sources availability, energy consumption density and carbon emission, accessibility on renewable energy, and etc. Advanced modelling techniques were systematically reviewed for integrated multi-energy systems. Decarbonisation pathways on both urban and rural energy systems were explored. Last but not the least, energy resilience on urban and rural energy systems was studied, including climate change database and modelling techniques, climate change on energy demands and power supply in district energy systems, energy planning strategies for energy resilience enhancement. Research results indicate that, rural areas are abundant in bioenergy (like biogas, biomass, etc), sufficient for renewable system installations, but limited access to modern energy services and energy poverty, while urban cities are characterized with limited spaces for renewable systems, unbalanced cooling/heating loads, and a large amount of waste. Modelling techniques for integrated multi-energy systems mainly include physical models, human knowledge-based machine learning models and data-driven models. The physical models and human knowledge-based machine learning models require specific expertise in physical mechanisms, while the data-driven models are superior in calculation efficiency and user-friendly interface. Energy resilience on urban and rural energy systems is able to ensure a reliable energy supply, and emergency plan to address disruptions from events, like extreme weather and natural disasters. To achieve climate-adaptive energy resilience and low-carbon transformation, main challenges include socio-economic equality access, deployment of charging piles and smart charging development for electric vehicles, battery circular economy in integrated rural-city energy systems, and carbon intensity of battery circular economy.

By reclaiming human-scale neighborhoods, relearning and further developing sustainable and passive building techniques, and reaching forward with technology in the service of society, cities can thrive with less energy and fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This chapter examines essential concepts and examples of low-carbon urban infrastructure, highlighting urban form designed in harmony with the city's geography; resilience to climate change impacts as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; and prioritization of demand-side management in city systems, through improved design, efficiency, and de-carbonization.",About Sufficiency
Social life cycle assessment of adaptive reuse,"Adaptive reuse of existing buildings and shared spaces has been highlighted as a key circular economy concept in the built environment, with the former also having been found to increase social sustainability through the preservation of cultural heritage. However, circular economy research has focused on the economic and environmental dimensions, with the social dimension receiving less attention. The aim of this study is, therefore, to establish the social impact of an adaptive reuse case with shared spaces. A supplementary aim is to test and adapt the general social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) framework to fit the built environment context. A qualitative single case study method is used. The study finds significant positive social impacts from the adaptive reuse case, mainly in the form of economic and cultural impact on the local community. The S-LCA framework was a useful tool in assessing the social impact of the case. Additional indicators of particular relevance to the built environment are identified relating to the end-users and local community, as well as indicators relating to society, value chain actors, and workers.Practice relevanceA set of sector-specific indicators is created to capture the social impact. The findings are useful for researchers and industry professionals intending to evaluate and increase the social sustainability of a construction or demolition project. The improved S-LCA framework and set of indicators allows for an improved understanding of built environment implications. Planners, designers, and clients can employ the revised framework to evaluate projects pre- and post-construction or demolition.",About Sufficiency
Spatial Correlation of Land Use Carbon Budget Based on Social Network Analysis： A Case Study of Chongqing Metropolitan Area,"Clarifying the temporal and spatial changes in the carbon budget in the Chongqing metropolitan area and exploring the spatial correlation of land use carbon budget are of great significance for realizing the regional ""double carbon"" goal.

The Impact of Household Dynamics on Land-Use Change in China: Past Experiences and Future Implications,"Population is the main driver of land-system and environmental change. However, population is usually treated as a variable that only considers the population number, and multi-dimensional population structure is largely ignored. There has been a systematic transition of population structure in the past several decades, including changes in household structure, increasing aging populations, increasing divorce rates, and increasing human migration. All of these changes have direct or indirect impacts on land use and environmental issues. Here, taking China as an example and using statistical analysis, namely the Mann–Kendall trend test and a land-use-transition matrix, we examine the relationship between household dynamics and land-use change in China by examining changes in household structure and land-use changes in China between 1980 and 2020. The results show the following three groups of findings. (1) The number of households increased by 130.95% from 1980 to 2020, while the population only increased by 42.83%; the size of households decreased from 4.41 to 2.62 in China from 1982 to 2020; and the household dynamics varied from province to province, which is affected by urbanization rate and economic development. (2) Birth rates, divorce rates, population aging, and migration all affect household structure, which directly or indirectly affect changes in land-use systems. (3) The changes in China’s land use are interlinked and interact with changes in household structure, which is evident in the increase in Residential land use and the abandonment of arable land. The rising household number increased the area of urban and rural settlement, leading to the fragmentation of cultivated land and the reduction of ecological land. To regulate land-use change for sustainable development, future land-use planning should take into account the effect of household dynamics and should reduce the negative effects of household dynamics on land systems and environmental change.",About Sufficiency
"Constructing a Future Green Space Ecological Network Based on Multi-Scenario Urban Expansion: A Case Study of Chengdu, Sichuan, China","As urban spaces expand, changes in land use significantly affect the structure and function of urban ecosystems, particularly with challenges such as green space reduction and uneven distribution. This study focused on the central urban area of Chengdu, China, simulating and forecasting various urban development scenarios for 2035, including cultivated land protection (CP), economic development (ED), ecological priority (EP), and natural development (ND). The construction of green space ecological networks followed a systematic process, incorporating key methods such as ecological source identification, landscape resistance surface construction, and ecological corridor extraction. The connectivity of these ecological networks was assessed using the space syntax. The results indicated that: (1) Construction land expanded across all scenarios, with the ED scenario having the largest area, while the EP scenario resulted in a significant increase in green space. (2) Ecological corridors were established under every scenario, with the EP scenario featuring the most extensive and well-connected network, linking urban green patches with surrounding natural areas. (3) The EP scenario’s ecological network displayed integration, choice, connectivity, and depth values that indicate the most complete and stable network structure.

Merging Green and Active Transportation Infrastructure towards an Equitable Accessibility to Green Areas: Barcelona Green Axes,"The UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for the provision of universal access to: (a) safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces, and (b) safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all. The Barcelona green axes plan aims to transform one third of the streets within its 19th century extension grid, increasing the tree cover and the vegetation, adopting sustainable urban drainage systems, limiting motor traffic, and providing a safer and more comfortable environment for pedestrians, cyclists, and other social activities in healthier environments. These transformations become even greater at the intersection of the axes, where former traffic junctions are becoming squares and urban gardens. This study gives an in-depth analysis of the origins of the superblocks plan, the rationale behind the transformation, and the implementation process. The GIS-based analysis shows how the green axes and the new square gardens (a) transform the city’s disconnected urban green areas into a more interconnected green infrastructure system, and (b) significantly increase accessibility to green areas. The study reveals this strategy’s potential to create a city of proximity, improve the well-being of the population, and build a more equitable city, which could be a useful tool for planning and decision making at both city and regional levels.",About Sufficiency
Enabling Sufficiency Through Smart Locks: Transforming Office Occupancy and Building Management for Energy Savings,"In the aftermath of the global pandemic, the widespread embrace of flexible working models has led to suboptimal occupancy levels in office buildings. Despite this shift, traditional space management practices persist, contributing to increased energy consumption per person. This study investigates how integrating smart lock systems can enhance space utilization within flexible working environments, ultimately reducing energy use. A case study of an office building in Milan, Italy, is used to evaluate the proposed approach. The methodology includes a comprehensive assessment of building design and functionality, coupled with impact analyses using Building Energy Modeling and Life Cycle Assessment. The results indicate that innovative occupancy management strategies can achieve energy savings of from 9% up to 14% compared to baseline operational energy use, leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 7.5 to 17.6 kgCO2eq/m2 depending on occupancy scenarios. The life cycle assessment reveals that, while smart locks introduce an initial embodied carbon footprint of approximately 2 tons of CO2, that is recovered through the savings obtained after a few months of installation. The findings demonstrate that this methodology is effective in buildings that allow both functional and temporal flexibility, enabling partial shutdowns and the redirection of certain services when not in use, ultimately improving energy efficiency through lean interventions.",About Sufficiency

Green Corridors and Social Connectivity with a Sustainable Approach in the City of Cuzco in Peru,"The present research aims to propose the design of a green corridor with a systemic/sustainable approach to function as an ecological lung for the city of Cuzco. A lack of planning has resulted in uncontrolled urban development, with a shortage of green areas, negatively affecting the quality of life. Green corridors stand out as solutions that encourage social interaction and improve public health. This approach recognizes the need for balanced resource management and institutional, economic and social organization. In the specific case of Cusco, the lack of social interaction highlights the importance of addressing these challenges to improve the quality of life for both residents and visitors. The methods developed were an extensive literature review, urban analysis and climate analysis, applying sustainability strategies supported by digital tools (Google Earth, Climate Consultant 6.0, Autocad, SketchUp and 3d Sun Path). As a result, this proposal presents green areas covering 69.96% of the total area, aimed at providing recreational spaces and connecting residents and visitors with nature. Additionally, biolakes were designed, accounting for 3.18% of the area, serving as ornamental elements and contributing to the environmental quality of the urban environment. The botanical zone, encompassing 18.14% of the project, was designed to accommodate a diverse range of plant species, providing an educational and aesthetic environment. The convention area, representing 9.7% of the total area, was designed to host events and community activities, promoting social and cultural interaction. Finally, 0.98% of the space was allocated to the cultural zone, where artistic exhibitions, cultural events, and related activities can be planned, enriching the cultural and social life of the community. These percentages reflect careful consideration of the needs and aspirations of the population, as well as a comprehensive approach to sustainable urban design and the creation of multifunctional spaces. In conclusion, through a green corridor, the aim is to counteract uncontrolled urban expansion and environmental degradation by generating a green lung in the city of Cuzco, naturally regulating the climate and contributing to air and water purification. The absence of green corridors and sustainable approaches to social connectivity in Cusco could reduce the quality of life of residents, affecting their physical and mental health. The lack of green and recreational spaces could increase segregation and alienation in the community, weakening social cohesion. Without green corridors, the city would also face environmental and biodiversity challenges, as well as a reduced ability to respond to extreme weather events. The lack of implementation of these strategies could compromise comprehensive development and quality of life in Cuzco.",About Sufficiency
"Manuscript title: Optimal mix study of sustainable lightweight composite bricks incorporating clay, wool and cork materials using circular economy approaches","Sustainable insulation is an integral part of energy efficient building design. Buildings have a significant carbon and energy footprint and using sustainable material is key to their decarbonization especially in cladding. In additional traditional cladding materials are not environmentally friendly. In developing countries with constrained construction budgets, limited resources and existing energy poverty using local resources is important to sustainable development, reducing building energy demand and supporting the local circular economy. Hence the aim of this research is to assess the thermal insulation and mechanical properties to identify an optimal mix of clay, cork, and sheep wool in composite bricks to improve energy efficiency in buildings. The novelty is that wool was introduced into the composite via an innovative method in the form of yarn network layers. The obtained results revealed that the thermomechanically optimal composite, which is clay specimen incorporating 12 % of the cork mass percentage with 2 % of wool in one layer (ClW2Co12) provides a gain of 64 % in thermal conductivity, 49 % in thermal effusivity, and 50 % in thermal diffusivity. Furthermore, the specimen ClW2Co12 is 14 % higher in flexural and 24 % lower in compressive strength compared to the reference material (clay alone) at the 30-day setting period. This innovative method ameliorates the lightness of the elaborated ClW2Co12 brick by about 52 %. These findings indicate that the developed composite made with locally available and economically local sustainable materials can be well used as thermal insulator in buildings using a circular economy approach.",About Sufficiency
Mapping the capacity of concave green land in mitigating urban pluvial floods and its beneficiaries,"Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied ""Sponge City"" plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis, and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. CGL with a depth of 0.10-0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63-98.35% and inundation extents by 26.09-82.41%, resulting in a slide of the exposed urban population by 0.40-1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by 0.04-0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of CGL varies spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of CGLs and a potential combination with other flood mitigation measures. These findings could help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood mitigation measures.",About Sufficiency
Land use/land cover forecast and urban sprawl analysis in a Brazilian city in the Atlantic Forest Biome,"Urban sprawl, a consequence of urban growth, profoundly impacts land use/land cover, particularly in regions like the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, as this Biome hosts most of the Brazilian population and is recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot. This study uses geospatial techniques, the Cellular Automata model, and structural landscape metrics to simulate future urban land use changes for 2050. The simulation suggests a significant increase in urban areas by 2050, changing from 32.1% in 2020 to nearly 43% by 2050, mainly encroaching upon agricultural lands. Conversely, forest fragments are projected to decline (lost 3% of areas), and the connectivity analysis highlighted the loss along the rivers, emphasizing the need for proactive conservation strategies. Preserving periurban agriculture is vital for food security and sustainable development, while innovative management of riparian ecosystems enhances urban biodiversity and citizen well-being. Sustainable urban planning and conservation efforts are imperative to mitigate the adverse effects of urban sprawl and foster resilient cities.

Enhancing the Cultural Heritage through Adaptive Reuse. A Multicriteria Approach to Evaluate the Castello Visconteo in Cusago (Italy),"Cultural heritage can play a strategic role in developing a sustainable built environment, contributing to the improvement of the economic, social, and environmental productivity of a city. Human activities are constantly affecting the quality of the environment and altering the ecosystems, which produce negative consequences also on human wellbeing. Within this context, it has been much discussed how cities and the built environment can counteract this process by supporting more sustainable development. Adaptive reuse is defined as “a process that changes a disused or ineffective item into a new item that can be used for a different purpose”, which strongly triggers the sustainable development of cities. It can be recognized as a promoter of economic growth, social wellbeing, and environmental preservation, given its capability of both preserving past values and creating new ones. The adaptive reuse matches the main points of the circular economy, seen as the sustainable economy, which is aimed at the reduction of natural resource extraction and environmental impact by extending the useful life of materials and promoting recovery, reuse, and regeneration processes. Given these premises, the current contribution aimed to evaluate alternative scenarios for reuse in Castello Visconteo in Cusago, located in the Lombardy region (Italy), and understanding how adaptive reuse could contribute to generating new values within a circular economy perspective. In detail, four alternative scenarios were proposed to face the new needs born during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Since both intangible and tangible values must be considered, a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been applied by combining economic and qualitative indicators to define the most suitable function for its adaptive reuse. In detail, the Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments (NAIADE) was used to identify the best alternative solution based on the opinions of conflicting stakeholders. The innovativeness of the contribution is given by the combination of different methodologies, the preservation of the memory and the generation of new values, and the consideration of adaptive reuse as a strategy for the achievement of sustainable development within a circular economy perspective.",About Sufficiency

Measuring energy sufficiency: A state of being neither in energy poverty nor energy extravagance,"There is growing interest in energy sufficiency (ES); however, it remains conceptually debated and contested. This study presents a novel approach to measuring ES using unique microdata on the energy consumption of Japanese households. This approach determines lower and upper thresholds regarding domestic energy consumption for each household type and then identifies whether people really meet an adequate level of domestic energy services, with their diverse energy needs considered. The result illustrates that most people in Japan live in ES, despite about one-tenth being in energy poverty (EP) and one-twentieth in energy extravagance (EE). In addition, this study empirically clarifies the characteristics of people in ES, as well as those in EP and EE. People in ES and EE generally belong to higher income groups, live in larger houses, and are less committed to energysaving behaviours; the opposite applies to people in EP. As a policy implication, this study suggests more progressive energy tariffs and carbon pricing, as well as improvement in access to renewable energy for the EP population, to engender an inclusive low-carbon energy transition and allow everyone to achieve ES.",About Sufficiency
Measuring just accessibility within planetary boundaries,"Our societies struggle to provide a good life for all without overconsuming environmental resources.

We reviewed transport studies and discovered a substantial literature body on accessibility and social disadvantage, much vaster compared to the literature around environmental and ecological impacts of accessibility. We also show a gap in approaches that have integrated these two perspectives. Building on the review, we suggest a conceptual framework for incorporating environmental and social sustainability goals in accessibility research. We conclude the paper by pointing to key challenges and research avenues related to the framework, including (i) dealing with uncertainty and complexity in socio-ecological thresholds, (ii) integrating environmental limits into the conceptualisations of transport equity, (iii) measuring accessibility through other costs than travel time, and (iv) integrating both quantitative and qualitative data.",About Sufficiency

Metropolitan fringes as strategic areas for urban resilience and sustainable transitions: Insights from Barcelona Metropolitan Area,"In an urbanized world, the challenges posed by climate change need to be met through innovative planning for cities and regions. Urban resilience demands that cities adopt new models centered on carbon neutrality, ecosystem services and biodiversity enhancement, circularity, and social inclusion. In light of the multiple interdependencies of metropolitan systems and the natural and territorial potentialities present on their fringes, this paper discusses the metropolitan fringes as strategic for urban resilience and sustainable transitions. By combining a mixed-method analysis of adaptation and urban plans with semi-structured interviews performed with key technicians, the analysis is focused on an inter-municipal fringe zone within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area - the Bes`os territory. Aiming to contribute to the discussions related to Territorial innovation for cities and regions, the paper offers a multi-scale perspective and illustrates innovative urban transformation strategies across scales. The results highlight that governance and multiple planning and participation instances together with technical and financial support are essential for consensus building in an incremental process. Furthermore, the planning strategies of the case study sought to integrate and enhance the green and blue infrastructures and transform consolidated urban areas with a focus on energy transition, sustainable mobility, circularity, and social inclusion.

Although adaptation and urban projects have a critical local element, a broader and more strategic vision is necessary, especially in metropolitan fringe areas.",About Sufficiency
Estimation of the potential changes in the social impacts of transitioning to circular economy for multiple stakeholders — a case of Indian transportation infrastructure,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to understand the social impacts on various stakeholders — consumers, workers, value chain actors, local community, and society — who are directly or indirectly impacted by the construction of land transportation infrastructure. The study further extends to determine the scale of change in these social impacts with the incorporation of circular economy (CE) in the sector.MethodsThe study is based on the UNEP-SETAC methodology for social life cycle assessment (S-LCA). Separate questionnaires are designed for each of the stakeholder categories — ensuring assessment for every social impact category. Social impact scores (SICs) are determined for every social impact category for the existing business-as-usual (BaU) scenario for every stakeholder category. Furthermore, to determine the change in social impacts in a circular economy scenario, experts are interviewed to understand and account for the change. The change in social impacts is mapped using a “Potential Circular Impact” formula devised by the authors. Finally, the results are compared based on the scale of social impacts in the BaU and CE scenarios.ResultsIt is observed that in the BaU scenario, the value chain actors have the highest social scores, implying that value chain actors fare well in the selected social impact categories. Furthermore, the consumers have the least social well-being, followed by the local community. In the case of a transition to CE, it is observed that the highest social benefits will be available for consumers, whereas the workers will be least benefited. The results also present the scale of change with the adoption of circular economy with respect to every social impact category, as well as corresponding performance indicators.ConclusionThe study presents a general trend of the potential social trade-offs of implementation of CE in the construction sector. The results can aid construction management and policy makers to design and implement strategies for the welfare of various stakeholders.

Wood Energy and Rural Planning: An Analysis of Land Use Policies in the Siting and Regulation of Forest-Based Bioenergy Technologies,"Land use regulations have played a critical role in the siting and operation of renewable energy technologies. While there is a growing literature on the siting of wind and solar technologies, less is known about the relationship between local codes and planning decisions and the development of wood-based bioenergy technologies, particularly in rural places. This research examines the relationship between local land use policies and the siting and operation of different types of wood-based bioenergy technologies in northern Michigan, USA. Land use codes including zoning laws and ordinances related to wood-burning devices from 506 cities, townships, and villages within 36 counties in northern Michigan were combined with US Census data in a GIS database. ArcGIS was used to examine geographical differences between communities and socioeconomic factors related to different regulatory approaches. We found that areas with greater population densities and higher income and education levels tended to have more nuanced land use codes related to all scales of wood-burning, including residential wood heating, commercial-scale heating, and power generation. This paper emphasizes the importance of local decision-making and land use policies in shaping the development of wood-based energy technologies, and suggests the need for greater attention to rural community dynamics in planning the shift to a lower-carbon economy.",About Sufficiency
Sustainable Urbanism: Pathway to Resilient Strategies in Adapting Early Malay Town towards Low Carbon City,"Due to an alarming rate on the impact of global climate change, the integration of low-carbon goal in regeneration of historic urban areas is regarded as a key part towards the implementation of sustainable urbanism practises based on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Much studies on the planning and design of low carbon strategies concerned overwhelmingly on the new planned cities without much emphasis given on the implemented at old town centre. In the context of Malay early town, the adaptation of the low carbon planning as shifting in environmental conditions is regarded as paramount importance particularly in the planning of the urban form to address the growing complexity of urban fabric at the town. This paper therefore explores the developed framework of Low Carbon City initiative and integration of resilience as an approach in urban transformation and regeneration of Malay early town to provide the platform for understanding the complexity of urban-natural environment from morphological perspective. The purpose of this research is two-fold; firstly, to examine the role of discourse in implementing Low Carbon City Framework (LCCF) in Malaysia at large. The second objective is to identify the place-specific mechanisms based on resilience approach to understand the capacity of urban form system to absorb, adapt or transform in ensuring the dynamic equilibrium of the urban-natural system. Considering Kota Bharu as representative of Malay town, a discursive-analytical perspective framed to examine the upsurge of the LCCF that helps to understand the pathway towards integration of framework at national, state and district level. Such comprehension on implementation measure formed a basis to identify the interactions between environmental performance and urban forms pattern as strategies for resilience. A case study with mapping analysis were employed that revealed significant relations between socio-cultural and environmental dimension which shaped the formation and transformation of urban morphology of the town. This study concludes with an examination of possible future directions for integration of space-morphological approach to general urban resilience for future adaptation planning of Malay towns towards Low Carbon City.",About Sufficiency

Moving Towards the Circular Economy/City Model: Which Tools for Operationalizing This Model?,"As the world continues to urbanize, identifying and implementing new urban development models and strategies is necessary to face sustainable development challenges. To this end, the circular economy model can be implemented in cities in order to operationalize and achieve human sustainable development managing simultaneously, in a systemic perspective, the social inequalities issue and the ecological and economic crisis. Today there are many cities that are defining themselves as a ""circular city"" but, to date, a clear definition of this does not exist. In the transition towards the circular city, tools (such as evaluation, governance, financial, business tools) play a fundamental role. The aim of this paper is (after an analysis of the concept of the circular city and its implementation, starting from literature, official documents and reports) to identify and analyze tools for implementing the circular city model. In particular, a set of indicators to assess (positive and/or negative) impacts of projects and initiatives of the circular city agenda is identified.",About Sufficiency
Patterns of Urban Sprawl and Agricultural Land Loss in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Cases of the Ugandan Cities of Kampala and Mbarara,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is undergoing rapid urbanization, yet research comparing urban expansion and agricultural land loss in peri-urban areas is scarce. This study utilizes multi-temporal Landsat imagery to examine the impact of urban growth on agricultural land and fragile ecosystems in Kampala (a mega city) and Mbarara (a regional urban center) in Uganda. We distinguish between random and systematic land-use and land-cover (LULC) transitions in the landscape. The results reveal substantial urban expansion. Kampala’s urban area surged from 7.14% in 1989 to 55.10% in 2015, while Mbarara increased from 6.37% in 2002 to 30.95% in 2016. Correspondingly, agricultural land decreased, from 48.02% to 16.69% in Kampala, and from 39.92% to 32.08% in Mbarara. Notably, a significant proportion of urban growth in both cities encroached upon agricultural land (66.7% in Kampala and 57.8% in Mbarara). The transition from agricultural to built-up areas accounted for 14.72% to 28.45% of the landscapes. Additionally, unsustainable practices led to the conversion of wetlands and forests to agricultural land, with approximately 13% of wetlands and 23% of Savannah and forests being converted between 2001 and 2015. These findings underscore the necessity of monitoring LULC changes for sustainable urban growth management, emphasizing the importance of preserving agricultural land and ecosystems to ensure present and future food security. This research contributes to the understanding of urbanization’s impact on peri-urban agricultural land and ecosystems in SSA, providing insights that are crucial for informed urban planning and policy formulation aimed at sustainable development in the region.",About Sufficiency
Integrating Spatiotemporal Analysis of Land Transformation and Urban Growth in Peshawar Valley and Its Implications on Temperature in Response to Climate Change,"Examining the interconnected dynamics of urbanization and climate change is crucial due to their implications for environmental, social, and public health systems. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of these dynamics in the Peshawar Valley, a rapidly urbanizing region in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, over a 30-year period (1990–2020). A novel methodological framework integrating remote sensing, GIS techniques, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was developed to analyze land use/land cover (LULC) changes, particularly the expansion of the built-up environment, along with the land surface temperature (LST) and heat index (HI). This framework intricately links these elements, providing a unique perspective on the environmental transformations occurring in the Peshawar Valley. Unlike previous studies that focused on individual aspects, this research offers a holistic understanding of the complex interplay between urbanization, land use changes, temperature dynamics, and heat index variations. Over three decades, urbanization expanded significantly, with built-up areas increasing from 6.35% to 14.13%. The population surged from 5.3 million to 12.6 million, coupled with significant increases in registered vehicles (from 0.171 million to 1.364 million) and operational industries (from 327 to 1155). These transitions influenced air quality and temperature dynamics, as evidenced by a highest mean LST of 30.30 °C and a maximum HI of 55.48 °C, marking a notable increase from 50.54 °C. These changes show strong positive correlations with built-up areas, population size, registered vehicles, and industrial activity. The findings highlight the urgent need for adaptive strategies, public health interventions, and sustainable practices to mitigate the environmental impacts of urbanization and climate change in the Peshawar Valley. Sustainable urban development strategies and climate change mitigation measures are crucial for ensuring a livable and resilient future for the region. This long-term analysis provides a robust foundation for future projections and policy recommendations.",About Sufficiency
Municipal Solid Waste Incineration Ash-Incorporated Concrete: One Step towards Environmental Justice,"Municipal solid waste and cement manufacture are two sources of environmental justice issues in urban and suburban areas. Waste utilization is an attractive alternative to disposal for eliminating environmental injustice, reducing potential hazards, and improving urban sustainability. The re-use and recycling of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ash in the construction industry has drawn significant attention. Incorporating MSWI ash in cement and concrete production is a potential path that mitigates the environmental justice issues in waste management and the construction industry. This paper presents a critical overview of the pretreatment methods that optimize MSWI ash utilization in cement/concrete and the influences of MSWI ash on the performance of cement/concrete. This review aims to elucidate the potential advantages and limitations associated with the use of MSWI ash for producing cement clinker, alternative binder (e.g., alkali-activated material), cement substitutes, and aggregates. A brief overview of the generation and characteristics of MSWI ash is reported, accompanied by identifying opportunities for the use of MSWI ash-incorporated products in industrial-scale applications and recognizing associated environmental justice implications.",About Sufficiency

Nature-based Solutions for Climate-Resilient Urban landscapes: Implementation in the New Capital City of Indonesia,"The concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) emerges as a multidimensional approach to achieve sustainable development while enhancing resilience to environmental hazards, in solving the challenges posed by climate change and rapid urbanization. This article examines the integration of NBS in the development of the new capital city of Indonesia, located in Nusantara, East Kalimantan, focusing on its role in climate resilience and low carbon development. Methodologically, the study explores how NBS can effectively conserve green and blue carbon through a synthesis of literature, case studies, and policy analyses, thereby contributing to carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation efforts. Additionally, the paper examines the potential of NBS in reducing the impacts of hydrometeorological disasters, such as floods and forest fires, which pose significant threats to the region’s ecological integrity and human well-being. By leveraging the natural landscape and ecosystem services, NBS can mitigate urban heat island effects, improve air and water quality, enhance biodiversity, and reduce vulnerability to extreme weather events. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement, including the participation of Masyarakat adat (indigenous communities), in the co-design and implementation of NBS initiatives. Through inclusive governance structures and participatory planning processes, the new capital city can foster social cohesion, equity, and cultural resilience while advancing sustainable urban development goals. Overall, the integration of NBS represents a transformative pathway towards building climate-resilient and livable urban landscapes that serve as models of sustainability for Indonesia and beyond.",About Sufficiency
"Tourism-Induced Land Use Transformations, Urbanisation, and Habitat Degradation in the Phu Quoc Special Economic Zone","Dynamic development of tourism activities and rapid urbanisation in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) can lead to significant land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) and environmental degradation, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas. This study examines the transformation of land use and its associated impacts on habitat quality and thermal environment in Phu Quoc Island (Vietnam) over a 20-year period (2003–2023). Using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery and random forest classification, we quantify LULCCs and assess the environmental consequences of urban expansion on habitat degradation and intensification of the island’s thermal environment, focusing on land surface temperature (LST) changes. Our analysis reveals that rapid urbanisation, driven by large-scale tourism and infrastructure developments, has led to a significant loss of forest and farmland, leading to a 5.6% decline in habitat quality and a marked increase in LST. The study also highlights the uneven distribution of urban growth, with the majority of expansion occurring in the southern and central regions of the island. By applying the InVEST Habitat Quality Model, we identify key zones of habitat degradation and offer insights into the spatial patterns of environmental sensitivity and changes. Our findings underscore the need for integrated land use planning and sustainable development strategies to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of SEZ-driven urbanisation on island ecosystems. This research provides critical guidance for policymakers, planners, and environmental managers to balance economic growth with environmental conservation in fragile island environments.",About Sufficiency

In Vietnam, most studies focus primarily on city extents, offering little insight into urban growth across various provinces. This study, therefore, combined categorical land use and land cover change detection, Random Forest classification and expert interviews to quantify the urban growth between 2000 and 2020, assess urban encroachment upon other land uses, and identify key drivers shaping this growth in Thua Thien Hue province. Findings show that the urban land areas were 27.94 km2, 82.97 km2, and 209.80 km2 in 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively. Urban encroachment upon other land use types, especially cropland, barren land, rice paddies, shrubs, and forests, was observed in these periods. Additionally, accessibility to built-up areas, DEM, proximity to rice paddies, slope, proximity to street roads, accessibility to social areas, and proximity to cropland are the major spatial drivers of urban growth in the province. The study concludes that rapid urban expansion is evident in the province at the expense of other land use types, especially agricultural land use types, which may impact food security and livelihoods in the province.",About Sufficiency
Open data and stormwater systems in Los Angeles: applications for equitable green infrastructure,"Urban stormwater systems traditionally used ""grey"" infrastructure to manage runoff. Contemporary designs now incorporate ""green"" infrastructure, which offers additional potential benefits such as urban amenities and health. Understanding how green and grey infrastructure investments are distributed across urban areas is important for new goals of promoting environmental justice in planning. In California, for instance, public investments increasingly require a percentage of funds to be spent in disadvantaged communities. Recent advancements in the availability of high-detail geographic data in cities can support prioritising investments to fulfil these multiple benefits. This paper analyses the distribution of stormwater infrastructure in Los Angeles (LA) County in relation to design criteria, urban structure and sociodemographic information. It demonstrates an approach for identifying projects that simultaneously address engineering needs and promote equity. Statistical analysis of high-detail sewer locations reveals geographic correlations with key local design parameters, urban characteristics and sociodemographic indicators.

Open space fragmentation in Hong Kong's built-up area: An integrated approach based on spatial horizontal and vertical equity lenses,"Spatial equity embeddedness in fragmented open space has long been neglected but is now becoming a pivotal topic in sustainable urban development. It is unclear whether open space fragmentation has widened existing spatial inequalities. Thus, this study proposes an integrated methodological framework of open space frag-mentation and its associated spatial equity issue in towns at different stages of urbanisation development. Hong Kong's built-up area could provide a typical case to unveil this topic due to the high shortage of open space, continued urbanisation, high immigrant rate, large wealth gap and aging population. The characteristics of open space fragmentation forms in old and new towns are elaborated through landscape pattern analysis and principal components analysis. Spatial horizontal equity and spatial vertical equity based on demographic characteristics and social economic status are portrayed by means of the Theil index and spatial matching. The findings indicate that the heterogeneity of open space fragmentation is evidenced by the uneven distribution of residents' envi-ronments in the old and new towns. Statistics reveal that in addition to shape fragmentation, the mean values of use fragmentation, internal fragmentation, extensive fragmentation and location fragmentation in old towns are all larger than those in new towns. Additionally, internal fragmentation overall is embedded in more spatial horizontal inequalities, and there is a higher level of spatial horizontal inequality in old towns than in new towns. Vulnerable groups that rely more on open spaces, including children, the elder, low education groups, immigrant groups and unemployed groups, suffer more from spatial vertical inequalities in old towns than in new towns. The knowledge gained from this research could provide a valuable reference for open space planning at home and abroad.",About Sufficiency
Operationalising energy sufficiency for low-carbon built environments in urbanising India,"India's urbanisation is considered the largest national urban transformation of the 21st century, with its trajectory having a decisive impact on carbon emissions globally. This study defines and operationalises the concept of energy sufficiency for the growth of Indian cities which is expected to be largely driven by low- and middle-income housing. It combines theoretical framing with quantitative assessment of test models to present an operational framework of energy sufficiency that can be implemented through urban planning regulations. Based on the global budgetary limit to restrict global warming to 1.5 degrees C, a precautionary target of 1.0 tCO2 per capita per year is estimated as an energy sufficiency allowance for upcoming residential built environments. By optimising the average dwelling size, limiting the land-use intensity to low-rise (four storeys) and compact urban forms, and improving operational energy performance with adaptive thermal comfort, the carbon emissions from residential buildings can be sufficiently optimised to 0.84 tCO2 per capita per year. The integration of rooftop renewable energy can further reduce it to 0.56 tCO2. The co-benefits of the optimised costs of construction and operation make the case for economic feasibility and wider affordability.",About Sufficiency
Optimizing Green-Gray Infrastructure for Non-Point Source Pollution Control under Future Uncertainties,"Non-Point Source Pollution (NPS) caused by polluted and untreated stormwater runoff discharging into water bodies has become a serious threat to the ecological environment. Green infrastructure and gray infrastructure are considered to be the main stormwater management measures, and the issue of their cost-effectiveness is a widespread concern for decision makers. Multi-objective optimization is one of the most reliable and commonly used approaches in solving cost-effectiveness issues. However, many studies optimized green and gray infrastructure under an invariant condition, and the additional benefits of green infrastructure were neglected. In this study, a simulation-optimization framework was developed by integrated Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimize green and gray infrastructure for NPS control under future scenarios, and a realistic area of Sponge City in Nanchang, China, was used as a typical case. Different levels of additional benefits of green infrastructure were estimated in the optimizing process. The results demonstrated that green-gray infrastructure can produce a co-benefit if the green infrastructure have appropriate Value of Additional Benefits (VAB), otherwise, gray infrastructure will be a more cost-effectiveness measure. Moreover, gray infrastructure is more sensitive than green infrastructure and green-gray infrastructure under future scenarios. The findings of the study could help decision makers to develop suitable planning for NPS control based on investment cost and water quality objectives.",About Sufficiency
"Out of Gas, In with Justice: Findings from a gas-to-induction pilot in low-income housing in NYC","As cities and states across the United States increasingly commit to building decarbonization, gas stoves are garnering public health attention because, in addition to contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, they may pose a respiratory health risk. Disadvantaged groups, as defined by demographic, socioeconomic, and residential factors, are often late adopters of new technology. To ensure that disadvantaged groups are not left behind from this transition, WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a New York City community-based environmental justice organization, implemented the first pilot of gas-to-electric stove transition in low-income housing. The goal of this mixed-methods study was to evaluate the effect of this intervention on indoor air quality and to characterize the distinct experiences of low-income residents. Twenty low-income households were recruited and randomized to an intervention (replacement of gas stove with induction stove) and a control arm. Between October 2021 and July 2022, three 168-hr long monitoring campaigns were conducted to assess indoor air quality (NO2, CO, and PM2.5) and stove use pre- and postintervention. The impact of cooking events on indoor air quality was further evaluated during controlled cooking tests carried out in both gas and induction homes. To identify key characteristics of the end-user experience throughout this intervention, participants were invited to join focus group discussions. Between baseline and endline, 168-hr average NO2 and CO concentrations decreased in both study arms, likely due to seasonality factors. Still, the induction arm showed a 56 % reduction (95 % CI: -61.9 %, -15.2 %) in mean daily NO2 concentration compared to the gas arm. During controlled cooking tests, the median background NO2 concentration (18 ppb) in gas homes rose to 197 ppb and negligibly changed in induction homes. During focus group discussions, participants unanimously reported being pleased with the transition and highlighted quality of life improvements resulting from the unexpected intervention's ability to address energy insecurity concerns. Taken together, our quantitative and qualitative results suggest that decarbonization energy transitions can improve health by reducing indoor NO2 but need to extend beyond single appliance swap-out to address health issues resulting from energy insecurity.",About Sufficiency
TOOLS FOR DECISION-MAKING IN THE FIELD OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH BLUE-GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE,"In the present, regional policy faces the demanding task of developing suitable decisionmaking tools for regional development that will effectively take into account the need to mitigate climate impacts.

Visions for development and management of urban green and blue infrastructure: a citizen's perspective,"Ongoing urbanization leads to problems such as densification, loss of biodiversity, and social injustice in cities. For increasing urban populations, green–blue infrastructure (GBI) is an important element in compact cities contributing to human health, well-being, and the provision of important ecosystem services. We analyzed responses from two open-ended questions about visions, ideas, and topics for the development and management of GBI important for citizens of the city of Leipzig, Germany. The questions were part of an online survey accompanying the development of the local GBI planning strategy: Master Plan Green. The strategy is focusing on five guiding themes that are leading local and global debates about sustainable and resilient cities: biodiversity, climate adaptation, environmental justice, health, and sustainable mobility. We categorize citizens' ideas and suggestions, summarize frequent problems and conflicts, and link ideas and visions to the five guiding themes. As the last step, we discuss citizens' suggestions in order to minimize conflicts in GBI and to identify deficits in present local planning. Major problems and conflicts that were addressed by respondents relate to quality, usability, other users, activities, and safety and security of GBI. Numerous suggestions aimed to tackle these problems, for example, by designating separate use areas, adding naturalness, improving maintenance, and enhancing facilities. A range of ideas and suggestions were based on diverging expectations underpinning the challenge of matching heterogeneous demands of GBI users in an equitable fashion. Linking these suggestions to the five guiding themes reveals that most ideas are covered by one or several guiding themes and are considered in local planning strategies. However, findings also demonstrate that increasing the quantity of Leipzig's GBI is a central request from respondents. Sociocultural and economic aspects as well as conflicting demands among citizens should further be central to GBI planning to avoid injustice and achieve sustainability objectives. This analysis gives insights into opinions and visions of citizens regarding the development of the city's GBI network and thus substantiates major strategic and planning themes leading global and local urban strategies toward sustainable cities. Considering specific suggestions and GBI deficits that bother citizens on a local level, offers the opportunity to improve the social and ecological resilience of GBI.",About Sufficiency
"Decarbonization possibilities for affordable wood-framed houses in the south of the US. Comparison of conventional, circular, and regenerative options","The transition to more circular practices in the construction sector offers an alternative path to the predominant linear, high-polluting, and wasteful processes. To better understand the full impact of building materials and buildings over their lifespan and beyond, life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have been a field of interest and a growing body of knowledge over the past three decades. Moreover, recent studies stress the critical relevance of the end-of-life (EoL) scenario, particularly for wood-based construction, highlighting its potential for further decarbonization through circular strategies such as design for adaptability, disassembly, and reuse. However, there is a significant knowledge gap in the LCA literature related to environmental impact mitigation strategies specific to affordable housing options, despite the pressing and undeniable need for these typologies. This study contributes to filling this gap by performing a detailed whole-building LCA of an affordable single-family house prototype built in the south of the USA using a standard light wood frame construction method. Besides the standard as-built scenario, this study developed five hypothetical scenarios that evaluated the influence of different EoL options (recycling or energy recovery), increased circular strategies (reuse), and substitution of non-renewable materials with regenerative materials for insulation (wood fiber) and finishing (clay plaster), aiming to identify further possibilities and limitations for decarbonization of such typology and construction method. The results of this study consistently pointed out that priorities should be to (1) guarantee proper end-of-life of metals and wood-based materials. (2) To replace non-renewable materials with regenerative wood or earth-based ones. (3) To improve material reuse and construction waste diversion rates.

The Role of Life Cycle Structural Engineering in the Transition towards a Sustainable Building Renovation: Available Tools and Research Needs,"Given the current climate emergency and the ambitious targets of carbon emissions reduction, retrofitting strategies on existing buildings typically include reducing energy demand, decarbonising the power supply, and addressing embodied carbon stored in materials. This latter point redefines the role of engineers in the transitions towards a sustainable construction sector, being they responsible for designing low impact, sustainable and carbon neutral solutions. A Life Cycle Structural Engineering (LCSE) approach, inspired by the principles of Life Cycle Thinking (LCT), should thus be adopted for the sustainable renovation of existing buildings. Only recently have pioneering approaches been proposed, tackling multifaceted buildings’ needs, such as those related to energy consumption as well as seismic safety, but often disregarding LCT principles. This study presents a redefinition of the concept of LCSE for sustainable construction and a comprehensive review of available methods and tools to operationalise the LCSE approach in practice, focusing on the consideration of LCT principles in the retrofitting design process, integration of seismic loss estimation and environmental impact assessment, and implementation of integrated retrofitting strategies.

"Pathways between people, wildlife and environmental justice in cities","Wildlife are increasingly recognized as critical to urban ecosystems, but the impacts and benefits of wildlife on people in cities are poorly understood. Environmental justice scholarship has concluded that elements of the urban environment can create or exacerbate social inequity, but human-wildlife interactions have not been considered through this lens. We conducted a literature review on urban wildlife, human-wildlife interactions and environmental justice. We triangulated between these three bodies of literature to identify trends, gaps and research needs. We identified six pathways through which wildlife presence or absence, wildlife management and human-wildlife interactions in cities may lead to social injustice for people. Our review shows that wildlife affect nearly all aspects of urban life for people, including economics, participation in decision-making, patterns of urban space, human health, psychological well-being and cultural discourses. Through these six pathways, urban wildlife management disproportionately impacts marginalized and vulnerable communities and benefits affluent urban residents. Contemporary intersections of urban planning, wildlife management and histories of systemic bias exacerbate existing injustices in cities. Synthesis and applications. Though wildlife are often characterized as 'good' or 'bad' based on their effects on people, we conclude that this dichotomy perpetuates injustice for people and wildlife. Instead, we argue that a 'just city' fosters healthy wildlife populations through equitable decision-making. The pathways we lay out here offer a road map for incorporating environmental justice into urban wildlife management.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.",About Sufficiency
"Pathways for Cleaner, Greener, Healthier Cities: What Is the Role of Urban Agriculture in the Circular Economy of Two Nordic Cities?","As major hubs for energy and resource consumption and carbon emissions, cities are at the forefront of the discussion on the impacts of megatrends, such as demographic changes, technological advancements, and the shift toward climate neutrality. Despite growing literature suggesting pathways for cities to cope with these challenges, the intersection between circular economy and urban agriculture for sustainable urban development has been little explored, especially concerning practical applications. To bridge this gap, this study aimed to explore the role of urban agriculture in promoting the circularity of resources at the city level. Aarhus, in Denmark, and angstrom s, in Norway, provide the empirical context for this discussion that uncovers the barriers that impact the successful implementation of C-E practices in the context of UA and delves into how these obstacles challenge cities in transitioning to circular and sustainable food production models. Using a case study approach and qualitative data sources, the findings suggest that while urban agriculture demonstrates potential in reducing resource consumption, it requires further evidence-based research and clear monitoring tools to assess its environmental impact and economic viability. Obstacles to urban agriculture implementation include regulatory challenges, social acceptance of waste, high investment costs, and limited recognition of its indirect impacts. Concerning recommendations, local governance and public policies were found to play a central role in fostering circular urban agriculture by promoting collaboration, fostering innovation, developing regulatory frameworks, and showcasing successful examples.",About Sufficiency

This evolution highlights the need for integrated and effective responses to limit global warming to 1.5°C, through adaptation and mitigation measures. Public policies for sustainable urban planning, expanding green areas and encouraging resilient practices are essential strategies for mitigating the impacts of rising temperatures. This study seeks to contribute to the debate on the challenges and possibilities of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Brazilian urban contexts, especially in cities in the Amazon region. Research Implications: The thermal rise identified intensifies the impacts on urban thermal comfort, increasing vulnerability to heat waves, health problems and pressure on infrastructure. This reality reinforces the urgency of adaptation and mitigation measures, such as sustainable urban planning, expansion of green areas and resilient practices to contain the effects of warming. Hosting COP 30 in Belém is an opportunity for international projection and a turning point for urban and environmental management, which can catalyze public policies, modernize planning instruments and encourage greater social participation in decisions that affect the population. Originality/Value: This study contributes to broadening the debate on the challenges and possibilities of implementing the SDGs in Brazilian cities, especially in the Amazon. It highlights the importance of holding COP 30 т Belém, considering sustainable urban development as a collective process that requires collaboration between governments, civil society and international actors, aiming for global goals, quality of life and socio-environmental justice.",About Sufficiency
Patterns of Urban Sprawl and Agricultural Land Loss in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Cases of the Ugandan Cities of Kampala and Mbarara,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is undergoing rapid urbanization, yet research comparing urban expansion and agricultural land loss in peri-urban areas is scarce. This study utilizes multi-temporal Landsat imagery to examine the impact of urban growth on agricultural land and fragile ecosystems in Kampala (a mega city) and Mbarara (a regional urban center) in Uganda. We distinguish between random and systematic land-use and land-cover (LULC) transitions in the landscape. The results reveal substantial urban expansion. Kampala's urban area surged from 7.14% in 1989 to 55.10% in 2015, while Mbarara increased from 6.37% in 2002 to 30.95% in 2016. Correspondingly, agricultural land decreased, from 48.02% to 16.69% in Kampala, and from 39.92% to 32.08% in Mbarara. Notably, a significant proportion of urban growth in both cities encroached upon agricultural land (66.7% in Kampala and 57.8% in Mbarara). The transition from agricultural to built-up areas accounted for 14.72% to 28.45% of the landscapes. Additionally, unsustainable practices led to the conversion of wetlands and forests to agricultural land, with approximately 13% of wetlands and 23% of Savannah and forests being converted between 2001 and 2015. These findings underscore the necessity of monitoring LULC changes for sustainable urban growth management, emphasizing the importance of preserving agricultural land and ecosystems to ensure present and future food security. This research contributes to the understanding of urbanization's impact on peri-urban agricultural land and ecosystems in SSA, providing insights that are crucial for informed urban planning and policy formulation aimed at sustainable development in the region.",About Sufficiency
Scenario analysis of supply‐ and demand‐side solutions for circular economy and climate change mitigation in the global building sector,"Residential and non‐residential buildings are a major contributor to human well‐being. At the same time, buildings cause 30% of final energy use, 18% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), and about 65% of material accumulation globally. With electrification and higher energy efficiency of buildings, material‐related emissions gain relevance. The circular economy (CE) strategies, narrow, slow, and close, together with wooden buildings, can reduce material‐related emissions. We provide a comprehensive set of building stock transformation scenarios for 10 world regions until 2060, using the resource efficiency climate change model of the stock–flow–service nexus and including the full CE spectrum plus wood‐intensive buildings. The 2020–2050 global cumulative new construction ranges from 150 to 280 billion m2 for residential and 70‐120 billion m2 for non‐residential buildings. Ambitious CE reduces cumulative 2020–2050 primary material demand from 80 to 30 gigatons (Gt) for cement and from 35 to 15 Gt for steel. Lowering floor space demand by 1 m2 per capita leads to global savings of 800‐2500 megatons (Mt) of cement, 300‐1000 Mt of steel, and 3‐10 Gt CO2‐eq, depending on industry decarbonization and CE roll‐out. Each additional Mt of structural timber leads to savings of 0.4‐0.55 Mt of cement, 0.6‐0.85 Mt of steel, and 0.8‐1.8 Mt CO2‐eq of system‐wide GHGE. CE reduces 2020–2050 cumulative GHGE by up to 44%, where the highest contribution comes from the narrow CE strategies, that is, lower floorspace and lightweight buildings. Very low carbon emission trajectories are possible only when combining supply‐ and demand‐side strategies.

Enhancing Circularity in Urban Waste Management: A Case Study on Biochar from Urban Pruning,"This study investigates the potential of biochar production from urban pruning waste as a sustainable solution within a circular economy framework. Urban green waste, often underutilized, typically increases landfill burden and greenhouse gas emissions. Converting pruning waste into biochar reduces landfill reliance while enabling stable carbon sequestration. Utilizing the circular triple-layered business model canvas (CTLBMC), biochar’s impact is evaluated across economic, environmental, and social dimensions. This structured analysis is based on a theoretical framework and uses secondary data to illustrate the model’s applicability. As a result of the conducted studies, it was found that biochar derived from urban green waste not only improves soil phytotoxicity and enables long-term carbon sequestration, but also offers economic benefits, including municipal cost savings in waste management and diversified revenue streams from biochar sales. Socially, biochar production promotes community engagement in sustainable practices and supports urban greening initiatives, enhancing local ecosystems. The findings suggest that biochar production, assessed through the CTLBMC framework, represents a viable circular business model. This approach provides significant environmental, economic, and social benefits over conventional disposal, offering valuable insights for policymakers, waste management professionals, and urban planners advancing circular economy solutions.",About Sufficiency
Peri-Urban Food Production and Its Relation to Urban Resilience,"Food production on the urban-rural fringe is under pressure due to competing land uses. We discuss the potential to improve resilience for urban-rural regions by enhancing food production as part of multifunctional land use. Through studies of peri-urban land in the regions of Gothenburg (Sweden), Copenhagen (Denmark) and Gent (Belgium), recent developments are analysed. Arable farming has been declining since 2000 in all three areas due to urban expansion and recreational land use changes. In city plans, networks of protected areas and green spaces and their importance for human wellbeing have been acknowledged. Policies for farmland preservation in peri-urban settings exist, but strategies for local food production are not expressed in present planning documents. Among the diversity of peri-urban agricultural activities, peri-urban food production is a developing issue. However, the competing forms of land use and the continuing high dependence of urban food on global food systems and related resource flows reduces peri-urban food production and improvements in urban food security. The positive effects of local food production need to be supported by governance aiming to improve the urban-rural relationship. The paper discusses the resilience potential of connecting urban-rural regions and re-coupling agriculture to regional food production.",About Sufficiency
Reading Urban Green Morphology to Enhance Urban Resilience: A Case Study of Six Southern European Cities,"A loss of natural capital within cities and their surrounding areas has been noticed over the last decades. Increasing development associated with higher sealing rates has caused a general loss of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) within the urban environment, whereas urban sprawl and the improvement of road networks have deeply fragmented the surrounding landscape and jeopardized ecosystems connectivity. UGS are an essential component of the urban system, and their loss has a greater impact on, e.g., ecological and hydrological processes, threatening human well-being. Different types and spatial configurations of UGS may affect their own ability to provide ecosystem services, such as biodiversity support and water regulation. Nevertheless, the study of UGS spatial patterns is a research branch poorly addressed. Moreover, UGS analyses are mainly focused on public and vast green spaces, but seldom on informal, private, and interstitial ones, returning a myopic representation of urban green areas. Therefore, this study investigates the UGS spatial patterns within six Southern European cities, using the urban morphology analysis to assess all urban vegetated lands. Results revealed three main Urban Green Spatial Patterns (UGSPs): Fragmented, Compact, and Linear Distributions. UGSPs taxonomy represents a novelty in the urban morphology field and may have important implications for the ability to provide ecosystem services and, thus, human well-being.",About Sufficiency
Planetary Boundaries and the Doughnut frameworks: A review of their local operability,"The concept of Planetary Boundaries has sparked debate around tipping points and the limits of the Earth System for over a decade. Among the most investigated aspects is how to downscale this global concept to a country level, to make it operative at scales at which decisions are taken and policies applied. Specifically how to achieve applicability locally while keeping global relevance, however, remains unclear. The same is true for the ""Doughnut"" concept, which builds on the Planetary Boundaries framework and adds a social component to create a ""Safe and Just Operating Space"" (SJOS) within which humanity should live. This paper reviews these two concepts in detail, focusing on their local operability. Synthesis of the literature reveals that, during the downscaling process, either the global meaning of the Planetary Boundaries or the local characteristics of a country are lost. Further, the SJOS remains a very theoretical concept because a match does not exist between the Planetary Boundaries and the social components of the Doughnut. Identification of this problem therefore suggests that future work should calculate the Planetary Boundaries globally for each ecosystem first, and then downscale them by country. In this way, the global relevance of the Planetary Boundaries would hold, and the framework could apply to local policies. Furthermore, the ecosystem services could link the Planetary Boundaries with the social aspects of the Doughnut, and hence contribute to understanding why a country lies within or outside the SJOS.",About Sufficiency
Planning for spatial equity - A performance based approach for sustainable urban drainage systems,"There is a rising demand to use nature and natural processes to address a different range of urban issues, especially when looking at the risk of pluvial flood associated with climate changes and urbanization processes. Among the set of Nature-Based Solutions used in urban planning, Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) represent promising solutions to reduce the negative effects of urban water run-offs and to increase urban Ecosystem Services. However, SUDS can impact differently in the urban fabric and generate positive effects only on particular portions of cities. Planning of SUDS should try to consider not only the number of potential beneficiaries but also where beneficiaries are located in the city, as water sensitive approaches to urban planning must deal with distributive, procedural and contextual dimensions of equity. In this paper, we simulate different spatially explicit planning scenarios of SUDS for densely populated catchments in Sicily. Particularly, we evaluate the relation between the quantitative performance of SUDS in terms of reduction of hazard/risk of pluvial flooding and the number and location of beneficiaries -intended here as residents of different social groups. Results suggest that scenarios of SUDS generate benefits that are not equally distributed within the city.",About Sufficiency
Planning Strategies for Leading Energy Efficient and Sustainable City Development Case Study of Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city,"Bohai Rim has been marked as the most advanced economic development zones in northern China, which also brought along a series of issues such as high energy demand, resources depletion, environment pollution, etc. At this exact economic and ecological joint, China and Singapore governments proposed to develop an energy efficient, resources saving, environmental friendly and livable city over the 30sqkm abandoned saline-alkaline land, as a model that could be applied or duplicated for other cities development.

Assessing sustainability of Chiang Mai urban development,"Sustainable urban development is an increasingly important concept as cities around the world continue to grow and face challenges related to urbanization, including environmental degradation, social inequality, and economic instability. Chiang Mai is a rapidly growing city in Thailand that steers towards sustainability. In this work, we examine the state of sustainable urban development in Chiang Mai by analyzing various indicators, including transportation, waste management, air quality, and energy consumption. A multi-dimensional framework was used to assess the sustainability of Chiang Mai. Our analysis suggests that while Chiang Mai has made progress in some areas of sustainable urban development, such as promoting green transportation and waste reduction and reduction consumption, there are still many challenges to be addressed, particularly in air pollution, water management, transportation and energy consumption. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for policy makers, urban planners, and other stakeholders interested in promoting sustainable urban development. This study assesses Chiang Mai’s sustainability using a comprehensive set of 35 indicators. It was found that Chiang Mai has potential for sustainable development, but some indicators require improvement. The study presents guidelines for prioritizing sustainable development, improving air and water quality, promoting sustainable tourism, enhancing waste management, transportation management and energy consumption.

Systematic review and comparison of densification effects and planning motivations,"Do higher urban densities contribute to more sustainable cities and communities? This paper examines the effectiveness of higher density (as a means) for achieving sustainable urban development (the goal) following three lines of enquiry. First, a systematic review of the scientific literature (n = 229 peer-reviewed empirical studies) is presented on the effects of urban density. Second, the motivations for increasing urban density are studied in a systematic review of Swedish planning practices based on the comprehensive urban plans in 59 municipalities. Third, these two studies are compared to find matches and mismatches between evidence and practice. Although positive effects exist for public infrastructure, transport and economics, there are also considerable negative environmental, social and health impacts. This creates a challenging task for urban planners to assess the trade-offs involving densification and accommodate current urbanisation rates. Some topics are found to be over-represented in research (transport effects), seldom discussed in practice (environmental impact), and misaligned when comparing motives and evidence (social impact). Furthermore, for some topics, urban density thresholds are found that are important because they may explain some of the divergences in the results between studies.Practice relevanceThe transfer of knowledge from research to planning practice is a serious concern as planning strategies are not aligned with scientific evidence. Planning practice in Sweden is more positive about the contribution of higher density to sustainable urban development than the results of empirical studies warrant. The largest deviation is found in relation to the social impacts of higher density where the planning arguments are not aligned with the evidence. Several reported negative effects of densification (e.g. water management, recreational infrastructure, biodiversity) are not sufficiently accounted for in Sweden’s planning policy and strategy. The narrow planning focus on decarbonising cities and densification needs to be broadened to ensure cities are resilient against the effects of climate change and include mitigation strategies to reduce negative social, environmental and health impacts. The findings can be used to develop evidence-based planning strategies. Other countries can apply this process to assess their planning strategies.",About Sufficiency
Positive energy district stakeholder perceptions and measures for energy vulnerability mitigation,"100 Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) are to be created in Europe by 2025, with a stated goal of urban decarbonization. These are highly energy efficient residential urban areas, powered entirely through renewables. PED creation is to be guided by principles of quality of life, sustainability, and inclusiveness (specifically focusing on affordability and energy poverty prevention). Although there is research into the decarbonization aspects of PEDs, there has been little focus on the guiding principles, and their potential to reduce energy vulnerability. Using energy vulnerability factors and an energy justice framework, this article examines how the topic of energy vulnerability mitigation is perceived by professional PED stakeholders. Stakeholders from multiple countries were interviewed in order to determine how and to what extent they approached the topic of inclusivity and energy vulnerability. The contribution of this paper to academic research is in helping to frame energy vulnerability in European smart city urban areas, focusing on the perceptions of key stakeholders.

Promoting urban ecological resilience through the lens of avian biodiversity,"The significance of urban landscapes in safeguarding biodiversity is often disregarded, even though a considerable amount of conservation focus is directed toward biodiversity hotspots where urban land conversion is happening at the fastest pace. Maintaining biodiversity in urban areas not only benefits the environment, but along with social, economic, and technological factors can increase the stability of urban systems to disturbance, a concept known as ""urban resilience"". In this synthesis paper, we explore the ecological dimension of urban resilience and specifically focus on avian biodiversity because birds are easy to observe, relatively abundant, and can serve as an indicator of the overall health of urban environments. We first examine the concept of ecological resilience and discuss the role of environmental stressors associated with urbanization in the ongoing avian biodiversity crisis. We then provide an overview of characteristics of the urban environment that may promote ecological resilience in birds, and associations between social and economic factors and urban ecological resilience. Finally, we provide recommendations on future research regarding strategies to improve urban ecological resilience and thus, urban resilience as a whole, at the intersections of urban ecology, ecosystem ecology, environmental justice, and urban planning. Since 68% of the world's population is projected to live in urban areas by 2050, it is imperative that scientists, urban planners, civil engineers, architects, and others consider urban ecological resilience as a dimension of both environmental health and the resilience of cities to future natural and anthropogenic stressors.",About Sufficiency
"Public health perspectives on green efficiency through smart cities, artificial intelligence for healthcare and low carbon building materials","Introduction Smart cities, artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, and low-carbon building materials are pivotal to public health, environmental sustainability, and green efficiency. Despite their critical importance, understanding public perceptions and attitudes toward these domains remains underexplored. Additionally, the effective use of advanced technologies like convolutional neural networks (CNN) in predicting and promoting low-carbon solutions in construction is gaining attention.Methods This study employs a dual approach: (1) A survey of 200 respondents was conducted to gauge public perceptions and attitudes toward smart cities, AI in medicine, and low-carbon building materials. (2) A CNN model was developed and implemented to predict the performance of low-carbon building materials. The model utilized convolutional and pooling layers to capture local features and spatial information from image datasets, with tasks including image classification and segmentation.Results The survey results indicate high awareness of smart cities (80%), with 60% associating them with environmental protection and green living. For AI in medicine, 70% of respondents are aware of its applications, but only 45% perceive it as environmentally beneficial. Regarding low-carbon building materials, 60% expressed willingness to pay premium prices, and 65% recognized their positive environmental impact. The CNN model demonstrated high prediction accuracy on both training and validation datasets, effectively aiding in the identification of low-carbon materials and reducing building energy consumption and carbon emissions.Discussion The findings highlight significant public awareness and diverse attitudes toward these critical domains, suggesting the need for improved communication and advocacy for AI's environmental benefits.

A study of vernacular building materials in Bangladesh based on embodied energy and environmental performance,"Concerns over climate change have driven the need for decarbonization of the building sector all over the world. It is proven that manufacturing building materials consumes a substantial amount of non-renewable energy and releases carbon emissions. For this reason, it has become an essential need for finding clean and energy-efficient alternative building materials. In Bangladesh, vernacular houses in rural areas are made of locally found materials like mud, bamboo, thatch, wood, and others and are always used in the construction of houses without any industrial processing, these dwellings are composed of materials with very little or no embodied energy (E.E). However, there has been a significant change in the construction of houses and the use of materials in rural Bangladesh in the last two decades. Concrete, brick, metal sheets, and many other industrial materials have taken possession of indigenous technology and bio-based materials. As a result, environmentally sustainable traditional houses have been transformed into energy-intensive houses. This research aims to study vernacular building materials in Bangladesh to identify their embodied energy, climatic performance, thermal conductivity, and durability for constructing low-carbon and less energy-consumed buildings. Based on several case studies, field surveys, and literature reviews the assessment has been conducted, showing that these materials are highly efficient in terms of embodied energy and can also ensure great thermal comfort.

Municipal solid waste management: A review of waste to energy (WtE) approaches,"Global municipal solid waste (MSW) generation will increase to 2.2 billion tons per year by 2025 as per the World Bank projection. Improper waste management often leads to environmental degradation (i.e. water, air and soil pollution), transmission of diseases, and the release of greenhouse gases emissions, which contributes to climate change. To combat these problems, several countries are following the waste to energy (WtE) approach, which significantly reduces the volume of waste and generates renewable energy. Thus, the present study focuses on the municipal solid waste generation, composition, and waste to energy conversion technologies.

Through a case study in the Bangalore Urban region, we demonstrate approximately 90% classification accuracy in mapping fine-scale LULC types related to climate resilience, food security, biodiversity, and urban green space. Results also quantify spatiotemporal LULC changes from 2000-2023, revealing rapid expansion of built-up areas along peri-urban zones and declines in wetlands/forests. In addition to offering a scalable technique for smart cityfocused LULC monitoring, the proposed AI-RS framework also produces data to support policy decisions on ecological conservation zones, sustainable urban growth borders, and climate-adaptive landscapes.

Frameworks for Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) Indicators: Expert and Community Outlook toward Green Climate-Resilient Cities in Pakistan,"Climate-induced pressures spur on the need for urban green infrastructure (UGI) planning. This approach offers a possible way to improve ecosystem functionality and human well-being in adversely affected urban regions, wherein UGI is perceived as a green and nature-based climate change mitigation/adaptation strategy. In Pakistan, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province lacks such urban landscape and greening policies (ULGP) or legislative frameworks for transitioning to green action plans (GAP), to alleviate the risk of multi-climatic hazards. Thus, this study aims to investigate a sustainable UGI-indicator-based framework model, based on the due inclusion of the concerned stakeholders. The relative importance index (RII) and inter-quartile range (IQR) techniques are employed for field data analysis. The findings proclaim excellent reliability (α > 0.7) and internal consistency, wherein sustainable UGI indicators are grouped based on their importance. The results portray the ecological and economic sustainability dimensions as being important (RII = 0.835 and RII = 0.807, respectively), socio-cultural dimensions as being moderately important (RII = 0.795), and a set of UGS elements (RII ≥ 0.77) as vital for bolstering individual UGI indicators.

Furthermore, we found that people from high-income brackets have greater access to the benefits provided by golf courses than those in low-income brackets. To improve desert golf sustainability, we need to design courses that use less water and provide a wider range of ecosystem services beyond the game of golf, including climate regulating services and cultural services. Golf courses should be considered explicitly in sustainable landscape design, with particular emphasis on the diversity and accessibility of ecosystem services they provide in a regional context.",About Sufficiency
Re-Thinking Mining Waste through an Integrative Approach Led by Circular Economy Aspirations,"Mining wastes, particularly in the form of waste rocks and tailings, can have major social and environmental impacts. There is a need for comprehensive long-term strategies for transforming the mining industry to move toward zero environmental footprint. ""How can the mining industry create new economic value, minimise its social and environmental impacts and diminish liability from mining waste?"" This would require cross-disciplinary skills, across the social, environmental, technical, legal, regulatory, and economic domains, to produce innovative solutions. The aim of this paper is to review the current knowledge across these domains and integrate them in a new approach for exploiting or ""re-thinking"" mining wastes. This approach includes five key areas of social dimensions, geoenvironmental aspects, geometallurgy specifications, economic drivers and legal implications for improved environmental outcomes, and circular economy aspirations, which are aligned with the 10 principles of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). Applying circular economy thinking to mining waste presents a major opportunity to reduce the liability and increase the value of waste materials arising from mining and processing operations.",About Sufficiency
Reading Urban Green Morphology to Enhance Urban Resilience: A Case Study of Six Southern European Cities,"A loss of natural capital within cities and their surrounding areas has been noticed over the last decades. Increasing development associated with higher sealing rates has caused a general loss of Urban Green Spaces (UGS) within the urban environment, whereas urban sprawl and the improvement of road networks have deeply fragmented the surrounding landscape and jeopardized ecosystems connectivity. UGS are an essential component of the urban system, and their loss has a greater impact on, e.g., ecological and hydrological processes, threatening human well-being. Different types and spatial configurations of UGS may affect their own ability to provide ecosystem services, such as biodiversity support and water regulation. Nevertheless, the study of UGS spatial patterns is a research branch poorly addressed. Moreover, UGS analyses are mainly focused on public and vast green spaces, but seldom on informal, private, and interstitial ones, returning a myopic representation of urban green areas. Therefore, this study investigates the UGS spatial patterns within six Southern European cities, using the urban morphology analysis to assess all urban vegetated lands. Results revealed three main Urban Green Spatial Patterns (UGSPs): Fragmented, Compact, and Linear Distributions. UGSPs taxonomy represents a novelty in the urban morphology field and may have important implications for the ability to provide ecosystem services and, thus, human well-being.",About Sufficiency
Healthy Design and Urban Planning Strategies framing the SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities,"According to the “Urban Health Rome Declaration” at European meeting “G7 Health” that defines the strategic aspects and actions to improve Public Health into the cities, and referring to the Agenda 2030 in which the 11th SDG argue about “Sustainable Cities and Communities. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”, one of the most expressive syntheses of the challenging relationship between urban planning and Public Health is stated by WHO (2016): “Health is the precondition of urban sustainable development and the first priority for urban planners”. Referring to the Healthy Cities & Urban Health definitions, we can consider Public Health not merely an aspect of health protection and promotion, but an individual and collective condition, strongly influenced by the environmental context and by the strategies implemented by local Governments. The “Health in All Policies” strategy, clearly underlines how health doesn't depend only on the supply of the healthcare services, but also, on the quality of outdoor and indoor living environments.

Reinforcing urban resilience through sound landfill management: Addressing global climatic challenges with novel solutions,"This study explores the critical role of effective landfill management in enhancing urban resilience amidst the growing challenges of climate change. With global municipal solid waste projected to rise 69 % from 2016 levels to 3.4 billion tons by 2050, addressing improper waste disposal-currently affecting 67 % of waste-has become imperative. This mismanagement contributes significantly to environmental degradation, public health risks, and soaring economic costs, projected to increase by 154 % from 2020 to USD 640.3 billion by 2050 without intervention. The study emphasizes the necessity for advanced landfill technologies, such as bioreactor landfills, smart waste management systems, and the integration of digital twins and IoT. These innovations can enhance waste processing efficiency, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and yield economic benefits. For instance, bioreactor landfills can boost methane (CH4) production by up to 49 %, facilitating renewable energy generation. Additionally, green infrastructure, waste-to-energy technologies, and improved landfill designs are proposed to mitigate the effects of climate change, including extreme weather events that threaten landfill integrity and emissions stability. Key findings highlight the importance of integrating landfill resilience into urban planning and sustainable waste management strategies. A holistic approach combining technology, policy reforms, and community participation is recommended to build robust urban waste management systems capable of withstanding climate-related challenges. This work underscores the transformative potential of advanced waste management technologies in achieving resilient and sustainable urban systems, contributing significantly to global efforts in combating climate change.",About Sufficiency
Relationship Between Urban Tree Diversity and Human Well-being: Implications for Urban Planning,"Green spaces and trees are key elements for enhancing human well-being in cities. Despite recognizing the significance of urban greenery for human health, the role of urban biodiversity in shaping well-being remains poorly understood. This study focused on the interplay between tree genera diversity, perceived urban biodiversity, and the subjective well-being of urban residents in Karlsruhe, Germany. A map-based online questionnaire involving 302 participants investigated well-being locations and perceptions of biodiversity. Tree genera diversity was assessed for nine genera using remote-sensing and ground data. A novel approach of spatially correlating societal mapping results and tree genera cover maps revealed a clear preference for green spaces in the built-up urban environment. The relations between computed tree genera diversity and subjective well-being were unclear. However, there was a significant relationship between the perceived biodiversity of urban green spaces and subjective well-being. The amount of tree cover, the abundance of large trees, as well as the perceived species diversity beyond tree genera, lead to increased well-being of the urban population. At the same time, a perceived unkemptness of urban areas had a negative effect on the residents' well-being. This should be considered in future research and the design of urban green spaces.",About Sufficiency
Remaking the obsolete: Critical geographies of contemporary adaptive reuse,"Adaptive reuse, the repurposing of buildings for new uses, is an age-old practice designed to reimagine, remake and revitalize local economies, cities and communities. In more recent decades, reuse has become part of a systematic process of contemporary city building and a globalized practice of placemaking. As such adaptive reuse is much more that a technical or practical application but is rather a complex process that engages with and transforms the social, cultural and spatial dynamics of cities and their communities around the world. This article focuses on the contemporary geographies of adaptive reuse and highlights three key themes: reuse in the post-industrial city, reuse on the 'edges' and 'peripheries' of the global built environment, and reuse as part of the global sustainability discourse. Overall, this review highlights the rich and growing research across urban, cultural and environmental geography and exposes a number of ways in which this process operates as a powerful tool in shaping local and regional contexts.",About Sufficiency

Renewable energy from solid waste: life cycle analysis and social welfare,"In this study, municipal solid waste (MSW) composition in distinct world locations is compared and a case study is assessed. Three waste-to-energy (WtE) techniques are employed within the framework of an industrial partnership. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and a brief social contextualization including the production of renewable energy from the waste generated worldwide were held to attain a holistic view and attract the interest of multiple stakeholders. Incineration depicted a sustainable profile with improved results for global warming potential and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential. Regular gasification revealed the best results for eutrophication, acidification, marine aquatic ecotoxicity and human toxicity potential. Two-stage plasma gasification showed negative values for all impact categories i.e. achieving environmental credits. The estimate of the electricity produced from the waste generated per capita showed a fair coverage of the electrical demand in distinct world areas. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no reports connecting the electricity use, the waste production and the renewable energy achieved from WtE for different world regions. Therefore, this study supports the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable alternatives, reducing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining the comfort and commodities suitable for a comfortable quality of life.",About Sufficiency

Risky Business: Sustainability and Industrial Land Use across Seattle's Gentrifying Riskscape,"This paper examines the spatial and temporal trajectories of Seattle's industrial land use restructuring and the shifting riskscape in Seattle, WA, a commonly recognized urban model of sustainability. Drawing on the perspective of sustainability as a conflicted process, this research explored the intersections of urban industrial and nonindustrial land use planning, gentrification, and environmental injustice. In the first part of our research, we combine geographic cluster analysis and longitudinal air toxic emission comparisons to quantitatively investigate socioeconomic changes in Seattle Census block-groups between 1990, 2000, and 2009 coupled with measures of pollution volume and its relative potential risk. Second, we qualitatively examine Seattle's historical land use policies and planning and the growing tension between industrial and nonindustrial land use. The gentrification, green cities, and growth management conflicts embedded within sustainability/livability lead to pollution exposure risk and socioeconomic vulnerability converging in the same areas and reveal one of Seattle's significant environmental challenges. Our mixed-method approach can guide future urban sustainability studies to more effectively examine the connections between land use planning, industrial displacement, and environmental injustice. Our results also help sustainable development practitioners recognize that a more just sustainability in Seattle and beyond will require more planning and policy attention to mitigate obscured industrial land use conflicts.",About Sufficiency

"Developing a carbon footprint model and environmental impact analysis of municipal solid waste transportation: A case study of Tehran, Iran","The greenhouse gas emitted due to transportation is the third greatest emitter globally, and its impact has become a threat to the environment, public health, and economic development. Waste transportation is excluded in studies of waste management despite its significant environmental impacts such as global warming and human toxicity. The objective of this study is to develop a quantification model to estimate the carbon footprint of waste transportation and environmental impact assessments in three categories applied in Tehran using IPCC guidelines. In Tehran, light and heavy vehicles ran on diesel fuel. Data on fuel and waste characteristics were provided by Tehran’s department of transportation and municipality, respectively. In this study, transport-related emissions are 8.47 k tonCO2eq/y, and the carbon footprint of waste transportation is 93.57 g of CO2 eq per ton of waste transported (t.km), which is relevant to three main parameters: the amount of waste transported annually, the freight shipped from the temporary station to the disposal landfill site, and fossil fuels consumed. Also, an environmental impact assessment in three categories – human health (global warming, abiotic depletion, and ozone layer depletion), resources (fossil fuels), and ecosystem quality (acidification and eutrophication) – using SimaPro, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool is presented. Global warming (3.49 kg CO2 eq/t MSW), human toxicity (0.95 kg 1,4-DB eq/t MSW), and freshwater aquatic eco-toxicity (0.04 kg 1,4-DB eq/t MSW) have the greatest impact among categories. Sensitivity analysis of the effective parameters allows us to conclude one of the potential implications of this study would be the introduction of natural gas or biogas-based trucks replacing diesel fuel vehicles to improve air quality and mitigate the greenhouse gas emission.Implications: This paper addresses the significant issue of global warming, particularly in Iran, a developing country that ranks among the top contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. The study emphasizes the importance of evaluating emissions across various sectors such as electricity, waste, etc., Specifically, in this paper we focus on developing a model to quantify the environmental impact resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles, focus on the metropolitan city of Tehran as a case study. By examining the waste transportation process, we aim to provide decision-makers with effective strategies to mitigate the environmental consequences. In this paper, we develop a simple quantification term of Carbon Footprint to calculate total greenhouse gas emission of waste transportation process. Carbon Footprint is a fraction which, its numerator is total greenhouse gas emission and its denominator is total waste transported in traveled distance. Effective parameters have been investigated and based on parameters and emission factors taken out of IPPC, the carbon footprint model have been developed. The total greenhouse gas emission of this study and the carbon footprint has estimated at 8.47 k tonCO2eq/y and 93.57 g CO2eq/t.km respectively. Furthermore, the paper explores additional environmental impacts beyond global warming, including abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, photochemical oxidation, and freshwater aquatic eco-toxicity. Using SimaPro software these eight impact categories have been estimated. in this study we identify fossil fuel consumption, traveled distance, and mass transported are the primary parameters influencing greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon footprint. To reduce emissions in the waste transportation system, we suggest promoting renewable biofuels, highlighting Iran as a suitable candidate due to its high percentage of biodegradable material in municipal solid waste. Additionally, the study assesses nonrenewable energy and mineral extraction using the IMPACT 2002+ V2.15/IMPACT 2002+ method, revealing that global warming (100 years), human toxicity (100 years), freshwater aquatic eco-toxicity, nonrenewable energy, and mineral extraction have the most significant impacts on the municipal solid waste transportation system. Overall, this research underscores the need for quantifying environmental impacts and recommends strategies to mitigate them in waste transportation processes, particularly in developing countries like Iran.",About Sufficiency
The Contribution of Agroecology to Smart Cities and Different Settlement Contexts in South Africa—An Analytical Review,"This paper supports the idea of agroecology playing an integral role in development ‘smart cities’ and its application in different settlement contexts in South Africa.

This paper promotes ‘the smart city’ concept in different contexts, including rural and small settlement environments, incorporating agroecology, a paradigm which guides us towards building sustainable and equitable urban environments. This approach can significantly contribute to the improved and more resilient design and development of human settlements. The Preferred Reporting Items for Reviews and Meta-analysis were employed to analyze primary and secondary data sources, thereby formulating descriptive and analytical themes around agroecology and smart cities.

Rural-urban inequality in energy use sufficiency and efficiency during a rapid urbanization period,"Developing countries with rapid urbanization face challenges in providing sufficient energy to both rural and urban households in an efficient manner. However, few empirical studies explored both energy sufficiency and efficiency inequality in rural and urban households at the sub-national level within a nation during a rapid urbanization period to inform equitable energy transitions. Therefore, this research collected 2000-2019 subnational-level data in China to explore the pattern of rural-vs-urban inequality in energy use per person (indicating sufficiency) and energy use intensity (EUI, indicating efficiency). Gini coefficients and disparity ratios, two social inequality measurements, were used to quantify social inequality in energy use. Fixed effect models with interaction terms were adopted to explore the impact of income, energy end-use structure, and floor area on energy use differences between rural and urban households. Gini coefficients of both energy measurements decreased by 43%-47% from 2000 to 2019, suggesting a more equitable distribution of end-use energy sufficiency and efficiency between urban and rural households. Rural-vs-urban disparity ratios showed that rural households in more provinces used more energy per person with higher EUI than urban households in 2019, compared to the pattern observed in 2000. Income in rural households had a statistically significant larger impact on energy use per person and EUI than that in urban households. By evaluating energy inequality in both sufficiency and efficiency from an overlooked rural-vs-urban perspective, this study enhances the understanding of social inequality in energy use and provides valuable insights into just energy transitions in urbanizing and developing countries.",About Sufficiency
"Energy sufficiency in buildings and cities: current research, future directions","HighlightsThis special issue is dedicated to the topic of energy sufficiency, where the guiding question is how decent living standards for all can be ensured without exceeding planetary boundaries. Despite increasing recognition of the importance of exploring sufficiency for cities, buildings and infrastructures, before this special issue little specialist literature has been available. Thomas Princen’s seminal work on sufficiency as an organising principle for sustainable living, with both a sense of ‘enoughness’ and ‘too muchness’, is a shared starting point. Papers in this issue varied in the aspects of energy sufficiency investigated and methods used: some focused on creating conceptual advances, others presented new empirical work from single or multiple countries, with citizens, professionals, policymakers and practitioners all centred in one or more contributions. Findings suggest that sufficiency can be integrated into city planning, building design, and everyday household and neighbourhood practices, while identifying the infrastructures that shape and support these changes. Sufficiency has been explored in relation to travel patterns, occupation of residential space, sharing facilities and heating practices. The benefits and challenges of living well with less have been identified for varied populations and places. There is still more work to do. There is a need to expand geographical scope. Research gaps remain in linking sufficiency to prosperity, in understanding actor–networks for sufficiency in ways that transcend the usual silos of ‘consumption domains’ or ‘policy sectors’, in recognising the role of infrastructure, and in understanding the practicalities of ‘doing’ sufficiency in our buildings and cities.",About Sufficiency
Assessment of alternative land resource utilisation towards Net-Zero and regional revitalisation through the circulating and ecological sphere in depopulated city regions in Japan: a case study of Hachinohe City Region,"The circulating and ecological sphere (CES) concept promotes a self-reliant decentralised society by utilising regional resources to achieve decarbonisation. The concept is particularly relevant to depopulated areas across Japan facing a continuous increase of underutilised agricultural land that brings environmental, social and economic challenges. This study recognises such land as a locally available resource to be re-utilised under the CES framework and mitigate issues in a depopulating community. Using the case of the Hachinohe City Region in Japan, this paper explores alternative land-use scenarios and identifies policy interventions to implement a desirable scenario that would contribute to the localisation of Net-Zero and regional revitalisation. The scenarios developed based on land-use change analysis, policy reviews and stakeholder interviews were: (1) an energy-dominant scenario (installing a photovoltaic system) and (2) an agriculture–energy combination scenario (installing an agrivoltaic system). The analysis shows that under both scenarios, Hachinohe City Region can achieve 100% renewable energy. There are other benefits, including job creation and, in the case of the agriculture-solar scenario, contribution to domestic food supply resiliency. The study recommends three policy interventions: (1) collaboration amongst the members of the city region to achieve its own carbon–neutral electricity supply; (2) investment for areas without transmission lines to fully benefit from their regional resources; and (3) support for local initiatives where local communities co-manage the resources and co-benefit from them. Based on the results, the paper further highlights the potential of the CES approach to deliver just transition from a spatial perspective.",About Sufficiency
"Scenario Planning for Sustainability in Stockholm, Sweden: Environmental Justice Considerations","The aim of this article is to see how awareness of sustainable development and environmental justice can be increased and operationalized in planning through the use of scenarios.

In Search of Eudaimonia Towards Circular Economy in Buildings—From Large Overarching Theories to Detailed Engineering Calculations,"The current study seeks to explore the underexamined or potentially under-researched social dimensions of circular economy (CE) in the context of buildings. Utilising a meta-synthesis approach, this paper builds on the two primary theoretical frameworks in the well-being literature: the eudaimonic and hedonic perspectives. The analysis of the selected articles reveals that these frameworks foster distinct modes of interaction and perception concerning one’s environment. A consensus is evident among the studies reviewed, advocating for integrating both eudaimonic and hedonic elements to achieve optimal well-being and happiness. Moreover, some scholars argue that for the attainment of sustainability goals and, by extension, CE objectives, the eudaimonic approach to well-being should be emphasised over the currently predominant hedonic inclinations. The research also attempts to open a discourse between the sometimes rather comprehensive, holistic, and hard-to-quantify dimensions of human well-being and the more logical, measurable, and tangible results-oriented approach towards the built environment. This investigation illustrates how well-designed building elements, aligned with CE principles, can play a pivotal role in fostering both environmental sustainability and human flourishing in the built environment.",About Sufficiency
Technological Innovations in Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture: Pathways to Sustainable Food Systems in Metropolises,"Metropolitan areas increasingly confront complex challenges related to food security, social inequality, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity, exacerbated by rapid urbanization, climate change, and the reliance on extended, fragile supply chains. Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) is recognized as a promising approach to mitigate these issues. For example, it enhances food security and nutrition by strengthening local food supply systems, improves livelihoods by providing employment and income for local residents, and promotes environmental sustainability through the creation of greening spaces and reduction of food miles. However, the full potential of UPA remains constrained by various technological, economic, and social barriers, such as limited growing spaces, lack of land tenure security, low economic efficiency, and insufficient public awareness and acceptance. Given that the technological innovations are critical in overcoming these barriers and maximizing the positive impacts of UPA, this review provides a state-of-the-art overview of advanced technologies and tools applicable to UPA, aiming to inform how these innovations can be better enabled to enhance UPA’s contributions to sustainable urban food systems. The review begins by defining UPA, categorizing its various forms, and exploring its multifunctional roles within urban contexts. It then presents a thorough analysis of a range of UPA technologies that serve specific purposes, including productivity and product quality improvement, space utilization optimization, resource recycling, and land use management. Furthermore, the review evaluates the current challenges faced by these technologies throughout the stages of research and development (R&D), dissemination and extension, and application and commercialization, employing an analytical framework adapted from Technology Life Cycle theories. In conclusion, the review emphasizes the crucial roles that UPA and relevant technological innovations play in transforming food systems and urban environments. It proposes four key recommendations: (1) enhancing funding mechanisms and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration for UPA R&D, (2) strengthening UPA technology dissemination systems, (3) promoting economic feasibility and market integration within UPA business models, and (4) establishing supportive environments among all stakeholders in the innovation process. These targeted strategies are essential for scaling UPA technologies, thereby strengthening food security, environmental sustainability, and socio-economic resilience in metropolitan areas.",About Sufficiency
Smart and Livable Cities: Opportunities to Enhance Quality of Life and Realize Multiple Co-benefits,"Throughout human history, cities have been centres of prosperity, ideas and innovation. These days, smart cities are creating a new buzzword across the world. Examples boom in Japan, Europe, UAE and Singapore while several others are shaping up on the drawing board.

Social housing as focus area for Nature-based Solutions to strengthen urban resilience and justice: Lessons from practice in the Netherlands,"Social housing typically encompasses neighbourhoods with low social-economic status. Here, environmental problems like climate change and biodiversity loss have a higher impact than in other neighbourhoods. Applying Nature-based Solutions (NbS) may enhance the resilience of social housing neighbourhoods and as such make cities more just. In this article we explore to what extent NbS can be applied, given the physical, social and financial limitations that define Dutch social housing practice, and -by doing so - what NbS can contribute to environmental justice. Based upon several Living Lab experiences and dialogues with numerous housing cor-porations, ten NbS measures have been identified that likely will match with current practices in social housing. Implementing NbS contributes to all aspects of environmental justice, with distributional justice as the most straightforward one (more NbS means more environmental benefits). Procedural and recognitional justice were found to be of crucial importance to make greenspaces worthwhile for the residents. Our study draws attention to the fact that NbS knowledge is key but currently still insufficient, both within housing corporations as within the key partners (local authorities, landscaping firms). This means that there is a growing demand to increase NbS knowledge in the social housing sector. We finalize this article with recommendations on how to meet this demand.",About Sufficiency

Using natural language processing and network analysis, we show that public sentiments and emotions on social media are reactive to these climate policy actions. Between 2009-2012, discussions around green building-led emission reduction efforts were highly influential in shaping the online public perceptions of climate action. From 2013 to 2016, communication around low-carbon construction and energy efficiency significantly influenced the online narrative. More significant interactions on net-zero transition, climate tech, circular economy, mass timber housing and climate justice in 2017-2021 shaped the online climate action discourse. We find positive sentiments are more prominent and recurrent and comprise a larger share of the social media conversation. However, we also see a rise in negative sentiment by 30-40% following popular policy events like the IPCC report launches, the Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal. With greater online engagement and information diffusion, social and environmental justice topics emerge in the online discourse. Continuing such shifts in online climate discourse is pivotal to a more just and people-centric transition in such hard-to-decarbonise sectors.",About Sufficiency
"Socioeconomics explain tree diversity, abundance, and composition in the compact city of Barcelona, Spain","Trees are frequently unevenly distributed in urban areas, and their diversity, abundance, and composition vary spatially. Some studies have shown that the unequal distribution of urban trees can be associated with de-mographic and socioeconomic factors. However, most studies have been conducted in diffuse urban systems using remotely-sensed tree cover within single or aggregated land-use types. We examined if the relationship between tree diversity, abundance, composition, and socioeconomic factors varied across land-use types (parks, streets, zonal areas, and total) in the compact city of Barcelona, Spain. We calculated tree species richness and abundance across 73 neighborhoods using 229,962 geo-referenced records of individual trees sampled in 2021. Life expectancy positively explained tree richness and abundance across land-use types, reinforcing that access to urban green infrastructure promotes longer life spans. In contrast, income did not positively explain tree richness or abundance, indicating that tree distribution does not directly result in biodiversity and green space in-equalities for disadvantaged groups in terms of income. Total tree composition across neighborhoods responded to socioeconomic gradients, evidencing that neighborhood appearances are socially stratified. Street tree abundance increased in densely populated neighborhoods, possibly because intense street tree plantings in these neighborhoods compensate for the lack of other green infrastructure. Urban tree planting, particularly in streets, can be an effective strategy to increase green spaces in compact cities to overcome the disparities resulting from the unequal distribution of urban vegetation. Long-term data on socioeconomic factors and urban tree distri-bution are necessary to determine how social stratification affects urban diversity.",About Sufficiency
The Role of Green Infrastructure in Providing Urban Ecosystem Services: Insights from a Bibliometric Perspective,"Urban ecosystems, and the services they provide, are a key focus of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, specifically SDG 11, which emphasizes making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Green infrastructure (GI) is crucial in enhancing citizens’ quality of life and achieving this goal and it can be defined as a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas designed to deliver a range of ecosystem services (ESs). These infrastructures improve ecosystem functioning, protect biodiversity, promote health, support sustainable land and water management, and boost the local green economy. This paper explores the scientific literature on GI and their ESs in cities using bibliometric science. By combining the keywords “Green Infrastructures”, “Ecosystem Services”, and “Cities” with VOSviewer software (1.6.20 version), we analyzed trends over time. Results show growing attention to these topics, emphasizing human well-being, urban resilience, and sustainability. The study also highlights that focusing exclusively on either “Green Infrastructure in Cities” or “Ecosystem Services in Cities” leads to fragmented insights. A more integrated examination of these three domains offers a holistic view and underscores the importance of considering ecosystem disservices. The study further identifies key research directions, including the need for a comprehensive evaluation of diverse GI types, especially those that are under-researched, such as green roofs, sports areas, and wetlands, and the underexplored role of cultural ecosystem services. Additionally, future research should consider both the benefits and disservices of GI to support better urban planning decisions. Finally, integrating biophysical, social, and economic values of ESs is critical for providing more holistic insights and enhancing sustainable urban development. The novelty of this paper lies in its integrated, holistic approach to examining GI and ESs in urban areas, with a focus on ecosystem disservices, insufficient attention to specific GI types, and the role of cultural ecosystem services—each contributing to the creation of more resilient and sustainable cities.",About Sufficiency
"Solar power for some? Energy transition injustices in Kerala, India","The Indian government advocates for a major shift from national reliance on coal to more renewable energy sources. While these aspirations are laudable, a political ecology review reveals the uneven power relations associated with the introduction of renewable energy in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Drawing from fieldwork, research traces how Kerala government solar projects, including schemes to promote rooftop solar, prioritize middle- and upper-class consumers. Historically marginalized communities, including people living below the poverty level and Adivasis (indigenous peoples), are not a priority for the state agency implementing renewable energy and thus are not beneficiaries of cleaner energy. This disconnected approach builds from and exacerbates historical political and resource inequalities and enables the persistence of social and environmental injustices, even while moving towards a lower-carbon future. This model does not allow for all residents to actively engage in decision-making about energy processes and proves to be a missed opportunity to think holistically about development and energy in tandem. Energy democracy provides ideas to disturb this uneven power structure, with cooperatives being one possible way to implement this change. As the case of Kerala underscores, India may undergo an energy transition, but it will not be a just energy transition without significant changes.",About Sufficiency
"Odor Emissions from Municipal Solid Waste Open Dumps Constituting Health Problems Due to their Composition, Ecological Impacts and Potential Health Risks","The presence of Hydrogen sulfide, Methane, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and other odorous compounds in the ambient air is the root cause of the offensive odor emitting from the MSW dumping yard. Composition features and health risks associated with odor emissions concentrations in MSW dumping yards. This paper aims to provide an overview of research on health problems due to their composition, ecological impacts, and potential health risks of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and to examine the relationship between VOC exposure and chronic illnesses in humans and the environment. In this study, a comprehensive investigation of VOC odor emission from an urban MSW dumping site has been performed. The VOC odor sample was analyzed using the GC-MS technique. The maximum VOCs concentration reported is due to tert - butylbenzene at 1.41 ug.m-3 and the minimum is due to Sec-butylbenzene at 0.07 ug.m""3. Scientific databases, including Google Scholar, California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA), and US EPA (Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), were searched extensively using a bibliographic technique, in addition to a case study on MSW dumping yard workers. The findings of epidemiologic and experimental research, the emission of odors as a result of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can cause a variety of non-cancerous health effects that are linked to abnormal functioning of the body's vital organs, including the nervous and coronary, and pulmonary systems. It can also have minimal impact on the environment by causing global warming and ozone layer depletion. The odor emissions from the dumpsite pose both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks to the health of the individuals participating in the dumping yard. As a result of these results, it is important to manage odor emissions (VOCs) during composting and take steps to reduce their negative effects on the environment and public health.",About Sufficiency
"Stormwater Management: An Integrated Approach to Support Healthy, Livable, and Ecological Cities","The practice of stormwater management has evolved from a singular focus on drainage to a multifaceted approach to support the integrated urban development of healthy, livable, ecological, and water sensitive cities from neighborhood to metropolitan scales. A review of the knowledge base and practice by the professional stormwater management community shows attributes that favor an integrative approach to achieve co-benefits across sectors. Research into stormwater management addresses its functional areas of drainage, flood control, flood plain management, water quality control, urban ecology, recreation, and city beautification. Legacy path dependance affects the potential to reform land use practices, while stormwater management practice is affected by climate change, sea level rise, urbanization, inequality, and poor governance. This review shows a status where technical methods are well advanced but integrative frameworks to address social, ecological and infrastructure needs are more challenging. The sensitivity of ecological issues is most evident in cities in coastal zones. Organizational initiatives are needed to counter the neglect of essential maintenance and sustain flood risk reduction in cities. Stormwater management is related to other integrative tools, including IWRM, One Water, One Health, and Integrated Flood Management, as well as the broader concept of urban planning. This research review demonstrates the opportunities and needs for the advancement of an integrated approach to stormwater management to support urban development. Stormwater capture and rainfall harvesting offer major opportunities to augment scarce water supplies. Nature-based solutions like low-impact development and the sponge city concept show promise to transform cities. Major cities face challenges to sustain conveyance corridors for major flows and to store and treat combined sewer runoff. The neighborhood focus of stormwater management elevates the importance of participation and inclusion to advance environmental justice and strengthen social capital. Integrating organizational initiatives from local to city scales and funding improvements to stormwater systems are major challenges that require leadership from higher governance levels, although governments face resistance to change toward integration, especially in countries with poor land use and public works management systems. Finding solutions to neighborhood issues and the connectivity of water systems at larger scales requires complex approaches to urban planning and represent an important agenda for urban and water governance going forward.",About Sufficiency
Green Infrastructure Designed through Nature-Based Solutions for Sustainable Urban Development,"With the goal of enhancing the quality of the environment, urban green infrastructure (UGI) is an essential element in sustainable cities, and nature-based solutions (NBS) are being carried out as new infrastructure solutions that increase the resilience of cities.

Supporting Cities towards Carbon Neutral Transition through Territorial Acupuncture,"Since a solution towards carbon neutrality in already highly populated territories that does not profoundly alter the territories has not yet been found, territorial acupuncture, a new methodology presented in this paper, proposes a solution to this challenge and simultaneously helps to counter the dysfunctional dichotomy between large urban centres and small towns. The aim of this study is therefore to present this new concept and its operation. Hence, a phased study was carried out. Territorial acupuncture is the result of merging different theories and practices, such as Biourbanism, urban acupuncture, and energy community design. For Territorial Acupuncture, the territory is conceived as a single organism and, just like acupuncture in traditional Chinese medicine, punctual interventions (in this case, interconnected energy communities) would benefit the entire territory organism. To make the theory work properly, it will be necessary to carry out multi-scalar and multi-disciplinary analyses over the entire territory to identify the intervention points and then proceed to the design and interconnection of the individual district. Thus, Territorial Acupuncture provides a new approach to the resilience of densely populated territories, which, through punctual interventions on a district scale, benefits the entire territory by modifying energy, socio-economic, and environmental dynamics.",About Sufficiency
Sustainability of Low Carbon City Initiatives in China: A Comprehensive Literature Review,"Low carbon city (LCC) has emerged as the latest sustainable urbanism strategy in China as a response to climate change impacts. Yet, minimal scholarships have explored the sustainability of the urban planning model towards understanding the complexity of the components. Using a two-step triangulation approach, this paper presents a structured overview of the LCC initiative in China as it relates to the transition to a sustainability paradigm. The data collection approach includes a comprehensive review of 238 articles on LCC to identify and categorize LCC components. Furthermore, discourse and framing analysis was used to develop and synthesize a conceptual framework for assimilating the components into four core sustainable development principles: Integration, implementation, equity, and scalability and replicability. The results indicate that LCC development in China is bias towards economic and environmental technological innovations and strategies. Additionally, several critical sustainability issues of LCC pilots were identified. These include a lack of social equity planning concerns for the most vulnerable population, dearth of social reforms that cater to lifestyle and behavioral change, top-down planning and decision-making processes, a technocratic rationalization planning approach, inconsistent LCC targets on inter-generational justice concerns, absence of an effective national ""sharing and learning"" city-city network system, and several barriers to implementation. We conclude that the applied theoretical and conceptual inquiry into the field of LCC is pertinent to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainable urban development.",About Sufficiency
Sustainability transitions of urban food-energy-water-waste infrastructure: A living laboratory approach for circular economy,"Urban areas often face versatile stressors (e.g., food security, congestion, energy shortage, water pollution, water scarcity, waste management, and storm and flooding), requiring better resilient and sustainable infrastructure systems. A system dynamics model (SDM), explored for the urban region of Orlando, Florida, acts as a multiagent model for portraying material and energy flows across the food, energy, water, and waste (FEWW) sectors to account for urban sustainability transitions. The interlinkages between the FEWW sectors in the SDM are formulated with multiple layers of dependencies and interconnections of the available resources and their external climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic drivers through four case studies (scenarios). The vital components in the integrated FEWW infrastructure system include urban agriculture associated with the East End Market Urban Farm; energy from the fuel-diverse Curtis H. Stanton Energy Center; reclaimed wastewater treated by the Eastern Water Reclamation Facility, the Water Conserv II Water Reclamation Facility, and stormwater reuse; and solid waste management and biogas generation from the Orange County Landfill. The four scenarios evaluated climate change impacts, policy instruments, and land use teleconnection for waste management in the FEWW nexus, demonstrating regional synergies among these components. The use of multicriteria decision-making coupled with cost-benefit-risk tradeoff analysis supported the selection of case 4 as the most appropriate option as it provided greater renewable energy production and stormwater reuse. The SDM graphic user interface aids in the visualization of the dynamics of the FEWW nexus framework, demonstrating the specific role of renewable energy harvesting for sustainably transitioning Orlando into a circular economy.",About Sufficiency
Sustainable Construction for Urban Infill Development Using Engineered Massive Wood Panel Systems,"Prefabricated engineered solid wood panel construction systems can sequester and store CO2. Modular cross-laminated timber (CLT, also called cross-lam) panels form the basis of low-carbon, engineered construction systems using solid wood panels that can be used to build residential infill developments of 10 storeys or higher. Multi-apartment buildings of 4 to 10 storeys constructed entirely in timber, such as recently in Europe, are innovative, but their social and cultural acceptance in Australia and North America is at this stage still uncertain. Future commercial utilisation is only possible if there is a user acceptance. The author is part of a research team that aims to study two problems: first models of urban infill; then focus on how the use of the CLT systems can play an important role in facilitating a more livable city with better models of infill housing. Wood is an important contemporary building resource due to its low embodied energy and unique attributes. The potential of prefabricated engineered solid wood panel systems, such as CLT, as a sustainable building material and system is only just being realised around the globe. Since timber is one of the few materials that has the capacity to store carbon in large quantities over a long period of time, solid wood panel construction offers the opportunity of carbon engineering, to turn buildings into 'carbon sinks'. Thus some of the historically negative environmental impact of urban development and construction can be turned around with CLT construction on brownfield sites.",About Sufficiency
Sustainable urban infrastructure in China: Towards a Factor 10 improvement in resource productivity through integrated infrastructure systems,"This paper emphasises that more holistic infrastructure systems are of great importance to achieving sustainable development of China and hence of the planet. Whilst rapid Urbanisation brings the prospect of economic growth and a higher standard of living, it may also involve unsustainable consumption of scarce resources (land, materials, energy and water), accompanied by environmental degradation (such as pollution, emissions and waste). The challenge is to achieve the necessary economic growth but with far lower resource use, and thus reduce the ecological footprint, as recognised by China's Circular Economy policy. Whilst developed nations should rightly aim for a Factor 10 improvement in resource productivity, Factor 4 is often seen as a more appropriate target for developing countries - a fourfold increase. This involves doubling wealth while halving resource use in order to return to an ecological balance. Arguably, even greater resource productivity is required. China's economy will need to achieve at least a sevenfold increase in efficiency of resource use to achieve the goal of 'all-round well-being of society' set for 2050, although some have argued that a tenfold increase (90% improvement) will be required. The paper highlights the significant contribution of transport, energy, water and built infrastructure to resource consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and the ecological footprint. It examines ways that China can move towards a Factor 10 improvement in resource productivity. This involves viewing infrastructure as 'a system to facilitate the delivery of services' to support social and economic development in an integrated, eco- or resource-efficient, cost-effective and socially inclusive manner, coupled with extending the principles of a 'product service system' more widely to an 'infrastructure service system'. It is argued that a revolution in thought and action is required to achieve the necessary paradigm shift in China, with the West leading by example.",About Sufficiency
"Introduction: 'Green cities' as urban models: contributing to new urban agendas, but how?","The quotation above taken from the foreword to the UNs New Urban Agenda (NUA) adopted in 2016 epitomises how, in the urban century, there is an increasing recognition that the sustainable planning and development of cities are no longer solely matters of local, regional and national concern. What happens in cities in the remainder of this century will impact more widely on a host of international and global agendas, notably those relating to green challenges such as responding to the climate emergency, biodiversity, resource use, public health (e.g. addressing air pollution) and promoting greater environmental justice. Reflecting this, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 of the UNs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN, 2015, 26), focuses on making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, whilst many of the other goals will require particular attention to how urban places develop if they are to be achieved. Part 1 of the NUA - the Quito Declaration on Sustainable Cities and Human Settlements for All - emphasises in its title the social goal that sustainable cities and human settlements should be for all. Part 2, the Quito Implementation Plan for the New Urban Agenda, also reflects the three dimensions of sustainability, including promoting [e]nvironmentally sustainable and resilient urban development.

Synergies and trade-offs quantification from regional waste policy to sustainable development goals: The case of Kyoto City,"Waste management policies introduced at regional levels can have a bearing effect on sustainable development goal (SDG) achievement at such levels, promoting certain SDG targets, while hindering other SDG targets. This work introduces an empirical methodology for estimating the synergies and trade-offs for a city-level waste management policy with SDG achievements, taking the case of Kyoto City's extensive waste management policy package and its interactions with renewable energy (RE) development (SDG 7), decent economic growth (SDG 9), reduced inequalities (SDG 10), and sustainable consumption (SDG 12). Similar interactions at the national-level are also enumerated with the justified indicators at the city-level being extended to the national-level. Through pairwise correlation, multiple correlation, and regression, four hypotheses for circular economy compatibility with SDG achievement were tested. It was found that manufacturing value and small business growth is stunted by circular economy-based waste policies, while resource efficiency is promoted. Cultural and social structures have trade-offs with stringent waste management at city-levels, but is neutral at aggregated levels. RE development is also synergetic with circular economy-based waste management. This methodology shows a pathway as to how national- and city-level policies can be integrated with each other in order to optimize waste management and overall sustainability.",About Sufficiency
Synergistic effects of regional environmental governance on alleviating energy poverty and promoting household decarbonization,"Alleviating energy poverty and lowering carbon emissions are two crucial goals that can help achieve sustainable regional development. However, to make this a reality, it is vital to understand the relationship between environmental governance and these goals, especially at the household level. This study utilizes microdata from the 2012-2020 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to construct models. We examine the synergies between reducing household energy poverty and emissions mitigation under regional policies, aiming to solve the long-standing energy poverty problem and reduce carbon emissions. Our findings emphasize that China's environmental governance exhibits significant synergies by concurrently addressing household energy security and promoting carbon reductions through integrated policy approaches. The efficacy and synergy depend critically on optimizing energy consumption structure, decreasing carbon intensity, and enabling technological advancement. These insights highlight the importance of top-level government design in balancing energy security and emissions reductions.

Measuring integrated accessibility for sustainable mobility: a fuzzy set approach case study,"Sustainable transportation is vital to climate justice and social equity. Despite the efforts to achieve sustainability, there is still a lack of adequate measurement that integrates land use and transportation systems, which can be barriers to planning implementation.

We do so by defining a fuzziness degree based on the different trip purposes and modes of transportation with a case study in Isfahan, Iran. Sustainable accessibility indicators were developed for walking, biking, and public transportation to represent the performance of each transportation system, considering the integration with land-use patterns. We analyze transportation modes and the accessibility to five main urban activities, including employment opportunities, education, healthcare, shopping, and recreation services, based on the travel distances, followed by a statistical integration method with Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for each travel mode.

We also highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of different estimation approaches. A comparability analysis of existing studies shows a clearly higher level of stocks per capita and per area in developed countries and cities, confirming the role of urbanization and industrialization in built environment stock growth. However, more spatially refined case studies (e.g., on developing cities and nonresidential buildings) and standardization and improvement of methodology (e.g., with geographic information system and architectural knowledge) and data (e.g., on material intensity and lifetime) would be urgently needed to reveal more robust conclusions on the patterns, drivers, and implications of built environment stocks.

"Technology for social well-being: Strengthening urban resilience in developing countries integrating infrastructure, energy, health and social inclusion","Conference Title: 2021 IEEE Conference on Norbert Wiener in the 21st Century (21CW)Conference Start Date: 2021, July 22 Conference End Date: 2021, July 25 Conference Location: Chennai, IndiaThis paper is based on the premise that the principal purpose of science and technological development should be the well-being of society in harmony with environmental sustainability. Vaclav Smil [1] argues “commonly used measures of energy use – be it conversion efficiencies, energy costs, per capita utilization levels, growth rates, consumption elasticity, or output rations – are just helpful indicators of the performance and dynamics of processes whose aim should not be merely to secure basic existential needs or to satisfy assorted consumerist urges but also to enrich intellectual lives and to make us more successful as a social and caring species.” Energy and electricity access and use is valuable not in itself, but for what it enables women and men “to do or achieve” [2]. Grubler studied the history of past energy transitions and identifies ‘grand patterns’, one of which being the critical importance of end-use — consumers and demand – “with technology and the social settings co-evolving, depending on each other” [3]. Feminist studies in science and technology treat technology as a ‘socio-technical’ product and describe the relationship between gender and technology as one of mutual shaping [4]. Gender and development studies put forward the concept of ‘gender mainstreaming’ which has been applied to infrastructure programs, such as energy, transport and digital infrastructure, based on gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) approaches. The paper draws from these frameworks. Norbert Wiener considered the resilience of urban centres in preparation for a potential nuclear attack and outlined what he considered to be some key features of urban plans. In the first draft of his urban plan, titled “Civilian Defense Plan”, his central argument is that the atomic bomb has rendered our previous understanding of civil defense obsolete and that “we need to reorganize our cities where they stand” – markets, points for medical supplies, hospitals, transportation, etc [5]. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the inter-relatedness and inter-connections between physical infrastructure, key utilities and services, and economic, health and social outcomes. There is an urgent need to rethink and transform cities to respond to the reality of Covid-19 and potential future pandemics, and to recover better, by building more resilient, inclusive and sustainable cities. International experiences show that cities with similar densities and levels of economic development have fared very differently in their ability to contain Covid-19. This indicates that the strength and duration of impacts of Covid-19 are not solely determined by a city's population density, but also by local capacity and preparedness to deal with such crises, infrastructure and service delivery systems, citizen's trust and confidence in society's institutions and the level of functional responsibilities and resources available to them through decentralized systems. Some of the key lessons for recovery and ‘building back better’ include the importance of an effective health system response, urban and regional planning, physical distancing, city-wide slum upgrading and housing programs, land-use and regulations to regulate hygiene conditions, significantly scaling up the low-carbon energy and infrastructure transition, access to key utilities and services for poor and vulnerable groups such as women, slum and transient populations, people with disabilities and the elderly, social protection, rethinking business supply chains, more resilient and inclusive ICT and digital connectivity and a pressing need to address gender inequality and social exclusion in relation to vulnerabilities. These new challenges require a new approach that integrates governance, physical environment and infrastructure, social environment, economic environment, planning and resourcing for resilience, and gender equality and social inclusion (GESI). The objective of the study was to develop an integrated approach to strengthening urban resilience based on infrastructure, energy and health linkages, with a focus on GESI impacts. Drawing from lessons learned from various connected fields: climate-related disaster programs to designing infrastructure; power and energy systems to incorporate resilience and reliability; universal health coverage and health system strengthening; and the preliminary lessons drawn from the activities undertaken to control the Covid-19 pandemic, a Resilience Assessment Framework has been proposed. The framework is intended to be used to assess the current resilience maturity level of a city. It can also be applied to measure progress, at different time intervals, towards a prospective target maturity level.",About Sufficiency
The barriers to using urban infill development to achieve smart growth,"The smart growth movement of the 1990s has seen many development and planning associations, state and local governments, and the Clinton administration encourage significant infill development to control sprawl and promote revitalization.

The Consumer as a Linchpin in Sustainable and Smart Urban Innovation Ecosystems,"Against the backdrop of the literature on technological innovation systems and innovation ecosystems, the paper analyses the sustainability transition in Smart Cities from an angle which we argue has not received enough attention so far, the central role of the consumer. The consumer is centrally positioned at the crossroads of Circular economy sectors making him a linchpin for sustainability transitions in which ICT figures prominently as a core technology and enabler of processes of consumption and production in industrial symbiosis. The recycling industry, the mobility sector and Green ICT - industries pertinent to the sustainability transition of Smart Cities - serve to illustrate and further flesh out this new role of the consumer. Current Smart City projects from around the globe are then mapped out with an interest in how the consumer (citizen) is involved in the process beyond being addressed as a service customer and beyond e-participation. The paper combines two hitherto separate but really closely intertwined areas: the technical sphere (industrial symbiosis and industry 4.0) and the management sphere (the Smart City) to reconcile the economic, ecological and social sustainability dimensions as envisioned in the industry 5.0 concept of the European Commission. Bringing the consumer to the forefront of sustainability analyses of Smart Cities can leverage the extent to which Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are actually met.",About Sufficiency
The Effects of Urban Containment Policies on Public Health,"Public health risks such as obesity are influenced by numerous personal characteristics, but the local spatial structure such as an area's built environment can also affect the obesity rate. This study analyzes and discusses how a greenbelt plan as a tool of urban containment policy has an effect on obesity. This study conducted spatial econometric regression models with five factors (13 variables) including transportation, socio-economic, public health, region, and policy factors. The relationship was analyzed between two policy effects of a greenbelt (i.e., a green buffer zone) and obesity. The variables for two policy effects of greenbelt zones are the size of the greenbelt and the inside and outside areas of the greenbelt. The results indicate that the two variables have negative effects on obesity. The results of the analyses in this study have several policy implications. Greenbelts play a role as an urban growth management policy, leading to a reduced obesity rate due to the influence of the transportation mode. In addition, greenbelts can also reduce the obesity rate because they provide recreation spaces for people.",About Sufficiency

I conclude that the ''golden egg'' argument makes an implicit analogy to resource economics and raises legitimate issues of sustainability and dynamic efficiency.

Thus the golden egg argument remains subject to cynical manipulation by both pro- and antigrowth forces.",About Sufficiency
The Guidelines of the Eco-City Based on Sustainable Urbanism,"Along with the population growth and industrial revolution, migration from the countryside to the cities increased greatly and unplanned urbanization is brought out.

Unplanned growth of cities leads to serious destruction not only on the natural environment but also on the human nature. A successful sustainable urbanization is possible that both physical and social sustainability studies are accomplished in integration with each other. Cities have continually been destroying nature due to the lack of recycling technologies, unplanned settlement and desire for constructing houses to green areas, air pollution and unhealthy infrastructure. As a result of them sustainable urbanism focused on the term of eco-city. Eco-city is a city designing and application approach in which human, city and environment issues are handled in relation and interaction with each other. In eco-city design, some principles such as reducing the effect of cities on environment, the use of renewable energy sources, the lowest level of waste production and the use of renewable energy sources have been taken into consideration. The eco-city provides healthy abundance to its inhabitants without consuming renewable resources than it produces, without producing more waste than it can assimilate, and without being toxic to itself or neighboring ecosystems.",About Sufficiency

Low carbon emissions are one of the most significant variables influencing sustainable urban development and combating climate change. Energy is essential and unavoidable for sustainability. Renewable energy will be critical to the world's decarbonized energy future. Ancient Iran was one of the first civilizations to address sustainability and climate change. There is a rich and sustainable urban planning heritage in Iran. Reviewing past experiences, technology, and knowledge is necessary to solve problems and move toward a better future. This manuscript discusses the various types of sustainability within this heritage and how we can utilize them to achieve sustainable development. These include Environmental Sustainability (Sustainable Water: Persian Qanat, Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System, Watermill, Cistern), (Sustainable Energy: Windcatcher, Windmill, Icehouse), (Sustainable Four Natural Elements: Persian Garden, Pasargadae, Persian Courtyard House), Political Sustainability (Sustainable Infrastructure, Information, and Communication: Trans-Iranian Railway, Chaparkhaneh, Persian Caravanserai), Economic Sustainability (Sustainable Economic Growth: Tabriz Historic Bazaar Complex), and Social Sustainability (Sustainable Security, Safety, and Resiliency: Underground City).",About Sufficiency
The lack of social impact considerations in transitioning towards urban circular economies: a scoping review,"Worldwide, cities are implementing circular economy (CE) strategies to reduce the resources they consume and their environmental impact. However, the evidence of the intended and unintended social consequences of the transition to ""circular cities"" is scattered. The lack of a coherent overview of the evidence on the subject can hinder effective decision-making in policy and practice. This study examines the extent to which the current literature addresses the social impacts that a transition to a CE produces in cities. We used a methodological approach related to systematic mapping to collate the evidence published over the past decade globally. The study finds that social impacts have rarely been considered in studies of circular cities, and where they have been discussed, the scope has been quite limited, only covering employment (mostly of informal sector workers) and governance practices. This scoping review highlights the need to further analyse and integrate social impact considerations into decision-making connected to transitions towards circular cities.",About Sufficiency
"The long-run effects of congestion tolls, carbon tax, and land use regulations on urban CO2 emissions","CO2 emissions caused by urban residents' energy consumption arise from 1) transportation and 2) housing energy consumption. This energy consumption depends on the spatial population distribution of the city. The current study quantitatively examines the effectiveness of i) congestion tolls, ii) carbon tax, and iii) land use regulations on the social welfare and the reduction of urban CO2 emissions. Results show that the congestion tolls can increase the social welfare by about 85% of the increase in the first-best scenario, which is the best result among the three policies, and can reduce CO2 emissions from commuting and housing energy by about 22% and 3%, respectively. These results suggest that congestion tolling, which is primarily the Pigovian tax for congestion, not only internalizes congestion externalities, but also effectively reduces CO2 emissions through downsizing commuting distances and housing sizes. Nevertheless, we show that because any spending, including consumption of goods, generates CO2, how tax revenues are used is important for determining total CO2.",About Sufficiency
The Making of Sustainable Urban Development: A Synthesis Framework,"In a time of rapid climate change and environmental degradation, planning and building an ecologically sustainable environment have become imperative. In particular, urban settlements, as a densely populated built environment, are the center of attention. This study aims to build a clear and concise synthesis of sustainable urban development not only to serve as an essential reference for decision and policy makers, but also encourage more strategically organized sustainability efforts. The extensive similarities between environmental planning and a policy-making/decision-making/problem-solving process will be carefully examined to confirm the fundamental need to build a synthesis. Major global urban sustainability rankings/standards will be presented, discussed, and integrated to produce a holistic synthesis with ten themes and three dimensions. The study will assemble disparate information across time, space, and disciplines to guide and to facilitate sustainable urban development in which both environmental concerns and human wellbeing are addressed.",About Sufficiency
The municipal solid waste management of La Paz (Bolivia): Challenges and opportunities for a sustainable development,"Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is considered an important public health, economic and environmental concern, especially in developing countries. This paper introduces the situation of MSWM in La Paz (Bolivia) in 2016, and is based on the Wasteaware indicators and waste flow analysis, useful tools for classifying and comparing waste treatment and management plans among other countries. Taking into account the lack of technology in waste treatment and the presence of a developed informal sector, the paper analyses the main strengths and weak points for implementing a sustainable MSWM. The research conducted revealed that the MSWM of La Paz is not efficient with regard to collection, recycling (8%), financial sustainability, and equity of the service. At the same time, local Government and stakeholders are interested in implementing new MSWM methods for improving the current sanitary state of the city and many efforts were made over the last ten years. In general terms, La Paz could be considered as a good study area for developing plans for waste valorization, becoming an example for a low-middle income developing big city of Latin America. The study provided a few considerations about the affordability of the methodology applied and critically analyzed the case study proposed.",About Sufficiency
The occupation of cropland by global urban expansion from 1992 to 2016 and its implications,"Large-scale urban expansion worldwide has exerted great impacts on cropland and its net primary productivity (NPP), which can affect whether food security and sustainable development goals will be met at global and local scales. Although important, the impacts at the global scale over the last 25 years remain unclear. Based on the latest long-term dynamic urban expansion data, this study analyzed global urban expansion and its impacts on cropland NPP from 1992 to 2016 at multiple scales. The results showed that the expansion of urban land occupied a total of 159 170 km(2)of cropland, accounting for 45.9% of the total expanded urban area. The cropland NPP decreased by 58.71 (56.52 similar to 59.81, 95% confidence interval) TgC as a result of urban expansion, which represents approximately 0.42% (0.40% similar to 0.43%) of the multiyear average of total cropland NPP from 2000 to 2015. If the cropland NPP losses were converted to the grain production (i.e. 1.44 x 10(7)tons), it is equivalent to the minimum annual food intake demands for at least 36 million people. More importantly, urban expansion is exacerbating the risk of food security in developing countries in Asia and Africa, such as China, Vietnam and Egypt. In the future, these countries should balance urban expansion with cropland protection by strictly restricting the occupation of cropland and encouraging smart urban growth.",About Sufficiency
"THE PERI-URBAN AREAS OF METROPOLISES, KEY TO GREENING POLICIES FOR IMPROVING THE LIVING ENVIRONMENT OF CITIZENS","Increasingly dense cities have substituted natural and agricultural spaces for urban sprawl, and inhabitants have expressed their discomfort. As a result of this finding, the first questions about cities were brought up in 1950 to analyze sustainable development and global warming as fundamental issues for research in order to improve the urban environment and make cities more sustainable and livable. The conclusions are alarming and, therefore, new greening policies are emerging, but how to achieve greening in dense cities? What kind of nature? Where? For whom? This article intends to inventory, observe, and assess these large projects to tackle this problem. The method is based on literature and concept analyses and fieldwork to understand the evolution of policies, projects, and challenges since the 1950s. We address the concepts of green belts, green infrastructures, green and blue frames, and linear parks initially designed in the heart of metropolises. Finally, we review recent projects of our interest, mainly two.",About Sufficiency
The politics of urban densification in Oslo,"Urban density is central to pressing questions concerning low-carbon lifestyles, affordable housing and global land use patterns. However, for many densifying cities, problems of inequality, climate emissions and social sustainability often remain unsolved or exaggerated. Adopting a relational perspective, this paper explores the politics of urban densification in Oslo, Norway. Arguing that urban density is assembled as particular political projects, the paper seeks to understand the achievements urban densification projects bring together, from housing policy to environmental policy, property schemes and financial strategies. Based on a qualitative study of urban densification strategies and projects in Oslo, the paper develops a typology of hegemonic and counterhegemonic urban density discourses and contributes to a discussion of how economically, socially and environmentally different kinds of urban densities may be assembled.",About Sufficiency
The Role of Energy Efficiency Design Decisions in the Embodied Carbon of Detached Houses,"Energy efficiency and the environmental impact of buildings are considered key strategic goals in the EU. However, the resulting increase in energy efficiency of buildings is shifting the environmental burden from the operational to other building life cycle stages. Thus, the presented study investigates the association between the total energy needs and embodied global warming potential (GWP) of building materials on 496,800 building models. These models were parametrically defined through variations of eight different energy-efficiency passive design measures. The results demonstrated that structure material choice significantly determines the total buildings' embodied GWP. Moreover, decreasing U values below 0.15 W/m(2)K is questionable as these buildings resulted in a slight reduction of total energy need but a disproportional increase in embodied GWP. Conclusions indicate that passive building energy efficiency measures should be evaluated from both operational and embodied environmental impacts, particularly if the future decarbonization of the energy mix is also considered.",About Sufficiency
The Role of Green Infrastructure in Providing Urban Ecosystem Services: Insights from a Bibliometric Perspective,"Urban ecosystems, and the services they provide, are a key focus of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, specifically SDG 11, which emphasizes making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Green infrastructure (GI) is crucial in enhancing citizens' quality of life and achieving this goal and it can be defined as a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas designed to deliver a range of ecosystem services (ESs). These infrastructures improve ecosystem functioning, protect biodiversity, promote health, support sustainable land and water management, and boost the local green economy. This paper explores the scientific literature on GI and their ESs in cities using bibliometric science. By combining the keywords ""Green Infrastructures"", ""Ecosystem Services"", and ""Cities"" with VOSviewer software (1.6.20 version), we analyzed trends over time. Results show growing attention to these topics, emphasizing human well-being, urban resilience, and sustainability. The study also highlights that focusing exclusively on either ""Green Infrastructure in Cities"" or ""Ecosystem Services in Cities"" leads to fragmented insights. A more integrated examination of these three domains offers a holistic view and underscores the importance of considering ecosystem disservices. The study further identifies key research directions, including the need for a comprehensive evaluation of diverse GI types, especially those that are under-researched, such as green roofs, sports areas, and wetlands, and the underexplored role of cultural ecosystem services. Additionally, future research should consider both the benefits and disservices of GI to support better urban planning decisions. Finally, integrating biophysical, social, and economic values of ESs is critical for providing more holistic insights and enhancing sustainable urban development. The novelty of this paper lies in its integrated, holistic approach to examining GI and ESs in urban areas, with a focus on ecosystem disservices, insufficient attention to specific GI types, and the role of cultural ecosystem services-each contributing to the creation of more resilient and sustainable cities.",About Sufficiency
The role of green infrastructures in Italian cities by linking natural and social capital,"Urban growth causes numerous threats to human well-being, as a consequence of the loss and degradation of urban and peri-urban green spaces. This research aims to investigate the possible role of green infrastructures (GIs), as providers of ecosystem services, in enhancing urban well-being in the 116 Italian provincial capital cities. The analysis has been based on the conceptual model proposed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) (2005) to explain how the four categories of ecosystem services (supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural) and the components of human well-being are interrelated. In order to perform the assessment, the most suitable indicators of social capital and green infrastructures have been identified from the panel of indices and indicators provided by national official statistics. The corresponding analysis has highlighted that northern Italian cities are characterized by simple but well-managed green infrastructures and wooded areas, with the highest level of social cohesion and inclusion associated with a high value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The southern part of the country is characterized mainly by ""Historical greens"" and high levels of health and social security but low levels of income, social inclusion and cohesion. This research represents a first attempt to link the different typologies of green infrastructures with the provision of ecosystem services. Given the recognized contribution of GIs in preserving natural habitats in an urban context, the SLOSS (single large or several small) debate, typically applied for conservation purposes, could also be appropriate for GIs. Therefore, it could be necessary to investigate whether fewer large nature preserves (large urban parks), or a patchwork of smaller green areas can better enhance human well-being in an urban context.",About Sufficiency
The social contribution of the circular economy,"The social value of the circular economy (CE) has only been recently explored in the literature. To understand the social implications of the implementation of the CE, a semi-systematic literature review was completed evalu-ating the variables of equity, diversity, collaboration, quality of life, maturity, and governance as derived from a capabilities approach. At a societal level, this article explores the main demands and contributions of the CE to society and identifies the inconsistencies in the literature in assessing the CE as a strategy for development, counterposing views of the CE's contribution to the socioeconomic system. Furthermore, the analysis proposes a set of socioeconomic strategies that can aid a CE implementation. We expand the 'rethink' tactic of the 9Rs (Refuse, Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture, Repurpose, Recycle and Recover) to also rethinking: the economic model, discourse, management strategies, ownership, business models, care work and value chains as well as remembering, reorganizing, and revitalizing. Furthermore, we include nuances to the 9Rs, adding regeneration. The qualitative assessment combined with a topic model offered specific areas where the social dimensions can be prioritized; these include food systems, the built environment with localized urban sharing, value chains, bioeconomy and mitigating the environmental impact of industries such as fashion and construction.",About Sufficiency
The social imperative in sustainable urban development The case of Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine social sustainability effectiveness of eco-cities through the case of Masdar City's strategy for urban sustainability in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Design/methodology/approach - Using a case study approach, the paper is an exploratory, qualitative analysis, which investigates the social, environmental and economic performance of Masdar City, a purported carbon-neutral, zero-waste urban development. Findings - Though Masdar City substantively contributes to innovation in sustainable urban development within environmental and economic contexts and has been effective in capital circulation in green technology markets, the impetus as a commercially driven enterprise is most evident. Successful sustainable urban development requires greater consideration for the social imperative. Practical implications - Eco-citymega-projects, such as Masdar City, have the potential to fuse achievements in innovation, technology and economic enterprise with the social imperative of functional urban habitats. Originality/value - Eco-cities are of increasing interest given the growing need for sustainable, energy-efficient living. This paper contributes through a novel case study, exploring how the concept of the eco-city has been developed and understood in the Masdar City context and discusses successes and deficits in its strategic implementation.",About Sufficiency

The uneven distribution of environmental burdens and benefits in Silicon Valley's backyard,"Inequalities in the exposure to environmental burdens and access to environmental benefits are an environmental justice concern for urban and regional environmental planning. Recent studies have assessed the exposure of different populations to a combination of environmental hazards through GIS-based Cumulative Environmental Impact Assessments (CEIA). The contribution of this study is the development of a CEIA, which incorporates the distance-based impact of transportation, the cumulative impact of environmental hazards, and access to environmental benefits for Santa Clara County (SCC), a highly diverse and rapidly developing region also known as 'Silicon Valley'. Our results show that social vulnerability, cumulative environmental hazards, and environmental benefits exhibit distinct spatial patterns in SCC. High environmental hazard values are found along freeway and railroad corridors with substantial industrial legacies, while environmental benefit scores are generally higher in the suburban periphery. Correlations indicate that socially vulnerable populations in SCC are predominantly hispanic and are more likely to be exposed to environmental hazards, while white and wealthier populations are more likely to have access to environmental benefits. The results from this study may serve to develop community-based initiatives for neighborhood improvement and environmental-justice-based regional planning and public health policy reform.

Stadium Travel and Subjective Well-Being of Football Spectators,"In the context of leisure travel in sport, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals to promote public health and combat climate change may be addressed simultaneously. This study investigates football spectators’ carbon footprint that is generated from traveling to the stadium. It also examines the effects of stadium travel and everyday pro-environmental behavior on spectators’ subjective well-being. The study uses data that were gathered from an online survey in Germany in 2021 (n = 1605). For a detailed carbon footprint assessment, spectators were allowed to indicate multiple transportation means if they switched them during their stadium journey. Seemingly unrelated regression models were calculated to examine the effect of transportation behavior (i.e., stadium travel) and everyday recycling, consumption, and energy-saving behavior on life satisfaction and happiness. Traveling to a home game caused an average carbon footprint of 7.79 kg CO2-e per spectator, or 190.4 tons CO2-e for all home game spectators. Regression results showed that sustainable consumption increased both well-being measures while recycling behavior only positively contributed to happiness. Stadium travel and energy-saving behavior showed no significant effect. These findings implicate that achieving both sustainable development goals can go hand in hand in some contexts of pro-environmental behavior, but not in all dimensions.",About Sufficiency
Three research priorities for just and sustainable urban systems: Now is the time to refocus,"Now is the time to refocus efforts in urban research and design. A changing climate and extreme weather events are presenting unique challenges to urban systems around the world. These challenges illuminate the social barriers that accompany disruptive events such as resource inequities and injustices. In this perspective, we provide three research priorities for just and sustainable urban systems that help to address these matters. The three research priorities are: (1) social equity and justice, (2) circularity, and (3) digital twins. Conceptual context and future research directions are provided for each. For social equity and justice, the future directions are mandatory equity analysis and inclusionary practices, understanding and reconciling historical injustices, and intentional integration with diverse community stakeholders. For circularity applications, they are better metrics for integration, more robust evaluation frameworks, and dynamic modeling at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Future directions for digital twins include developing principles to reduce complexity, integrating model and system components, and reducing barriers to data access. These research priorities are core to meeting several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (i.e., 1-No Poverty, 8-Decent Work and Economic Growth, 10-Reduced Inequalities, and 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities). Useful social and technical matters are discussed throughout, where we highlight the importance of prioritizing localized research efforts, provide guidance for community-engaged research and co-development practices, and explain how these priorities interact to align with the evolving field of industrial ecology.",About Sufficiency
Toward just sustainability in urban communities: Building equity rights with sustainable solutions,"Two concepts that provide new directions for public policy, environmental justice and sustainability, are both highly contested. Each has tremendous potential to effect long-lasting change. Despite the historically different origins of these two concepts and their attendant movements, there exists an area of theoretical compatibility between them. This conceptual overlap is a critical nexus for a broad social movement to create livable, sustainable communities for all people in the future. The goal of this article is to illustrate the nexus in the United States. The authors do this by presenting a range of local or regionally based practical models in five areas of common concern to both environmental justice and sustainability: land use planning, solid waste, toxic chemical use, residential energy use, and transportation. These models address both environmental justice principles while working toward greater sustainability in urbanized areas.",About Sufficiency
Toward Sustainable Development: Decoupling the High Ecological Footprint from Human Society Development: A Case Study of Hong Kong,"As a global financial center and one of the world's first-tier cities, Hong Kong is committed to sustainable development and it expects to become the most sustainable city in Asia. With this in mind, this paper evaluates the level of sustainable development in Hong Kong considering the factors of ecological footprint, biocapacity, and the human development index (HDI) from 1995 to 2016, in order to make policy recommendations for transforming Hong Kong into a more sustainable city. Between 1995 and 2016, a period during which the HDI rose, the per capita ecological footprint of Hong Kong increased from 4.842 gha to 6.223 gha. Moreover, fossil energy consumption had a crucial impact on the city's ecological footprint, whereas the biocapacity of Hong Kong declined gradually. By contrast, Singapore, a city-state with an area similar to Hong Kong's, presented the opposite situation-the HDI increased while the ecological footprint decreased. We performed a further comparative analysis and a SWOT analysis of Singapore and Hong Kong to elaborate on how to decouple the large ecological footprint from human society development. Concluding that the focus must be on energy consumption, reduction of the human activities' negative impacts on marine environment, citizens and government, we provide policy suggestions for transforming toward a ""high HDI and low footprint"" sustainable development society in Hong Kong.",About Sufficiency
"Toward Zero-Carbon Urban Transitions with Health, Climate Resilience, and Equity Co-Benefits: Assessing Nexus Linkages","Getting to net-zero-carbon cities while advancing well-being (W), health (H), social equity (E), and climate resilience (R) (referred to as the WHER outcomes) is critical for local and global sustainability. However, science is nascent on the linkages between zero-carbon pathways and WHER outcomes. This article presents a transboundary urban metabolism framework, rooted in seven key infrastructure and food provisioning systems, to connect urban decarbonization strategies with WHER outcomes. Applying the framework along with a literature review, we find the evidence for cobeneficial decarbonization to be strong for health; limited for well-being; uncertain for resilience; and requiring intentional design to advance equity, including distributional, procedural, and recognitional aspects. We describe the evidence base, identify key knowledge gaps, and delineate broad parameters of a new urban nexus science to enable zero-carbon urban transitions with WHER co-benefits. We highlight the need for fine-scale data encompassing all seven sectors across scales, along with multiple and multiscale climate risks, accompanied by next-generation multisector, multiscale, multioutcome nexus models.",About Sufficiency
"Towards inclusive and sustainable strategies in smart cities: A comparative analysis of Zurich, Oslo, and Copenhagen☆","Urbanisation has increased the need for sustainable urban development by positioning smart cities as critical frameworks for addressing environmental, economic, and social challenges. This study evaluates the sustainability strategies of three leading smart cities Zurich, Oslo, and Copenhagen by examining their environmental footprint, energy consumption, waste management, and air quality. The study uses a PRISMA-based systematic literature review to put together evidence from peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2024. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) was used to assess the quality of the articles. The study reveals that smart mobility and waste-to-energy systems drive Zurich's strengths in urban densification and public transportation, Oslo's leadership in renewable energy and electric mobility, and Copenhagen's ambitious carbon-neutral initiatives. Despite these achievements, challenges such as high implementation costs, slow technological adoption, and social equity issues persist, emphasising the complexity of achieving inclusive and sustainable urban evolution. To address these challenges, this study recommends increasing public participation through inclusive urban planning and digital platforms, strengthening policy frameworks, and funding for sustainability projects, and investing in data collection technologies to monitor real-time environmental impacts. Furthermore, fostering cross-city collaboration and addressing energy consumption challenges associated with AI and IoT are essential for scaling successful models globally.

Tower Neighborhood Revitalization in Toronto and Canadian Environmental Justice Politics,"In 2008, Toronto's City Council agreed to support the Tower Renewal Project, an ambitious proposal to renew over 1,000 aging concrete high-rise apartment buildings constructed largely between the 1960s and 1980s in socially and economically marginalized areas across Toronto, Canada. Over 500,000 residents live in these comparatively affordable high-rise buildings. These structures now require significant environmental upgrades to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions. In addition to proposing structural retrofits, the Tower Renewal Project is concerned with addressing environmental justice issues in high-rise neighborhoods such as the spatial organization of inequalities, transportation concerns, health inequalities, problems with existing zoning bylaws, and public participation.

Translating planetary boundaries into city systems: Ecosystem services as metrics for safe and just production-consumption space,"Accelerating urbanization has positioned cities as epicenters of water-energy-food (WEF) demand growth, yet their resource consumption patterns persistently exceed planetary boundaries. Resolving this dual challenge requires fundamentally rethinking cities' capacity to operate within ecological supply limits while ensuring basic human needs. We implement a city-scale adaptation of the doughnut framework, constructing a safe and just space (SJS) assessment model that quantifies ecosystem services (ESs) as linkages between WEF demands and ecological boundaries. Our analysis of 336 Chinese cities reveals spatial disparities: 91 % of cities in China can operate within their SJS for water provisioning, while only 25 % maintain current carbon emissions below ecological ceilings. Additionally, 28 % of cities simultaneously fulfill the SJS requirements for phosphorus purification. Regarding land use, 69 % can operate within the SJS, but most cities are approaching or already at verge of the biophysical boundary. In general, only 13 % of cities can adequately meet social demands within the boundaries of all four ESs. Random forest algorithm further identified social variables (e.g., population) and economic variables (e.g., industrial growth and gross regional domestic product) as dominant drivers of SJS performance. These findings underscore the imperative for adaptive governance that coordinates ES management through the SJS-ESs-WEF nexus, offering actionable pathways to align urban development with ecosystem stability and social justice imperatives.",About Sufficiency
Transportation policy as spatial planning tool; reducing urban sprawl by increasing travel costs and clustering infrastructure and public transportation,"Travel can affect land use just as land use affects travel behaviour of people. Low-cost travel, especially resulting from transportation improvements since the nineteenth century, has resulted in long-distance travel and urban sprawl, bringing along negative aspects such as traffic congestion and air pollution, but also reductions in biodiversity and public health. In order to try to partly reverse this process, the supply of infrastructure and public transportation can no longer follow the demand of transportation; the supply has to steer the demand. Infrastructure and high-quality public transportation should be clustered in and between large and regional cities. Increasing travel costs for car use (e.g., road pricing) can positively affect travel distances and travel mode choice, but also long-term decisions such as the residential location choice, stimulating compact, mixed-use developments. In this paper, we focus on Flanders, Belgium, a region where mobility policies stimulated long-distance travel and limited land use regulations did not hinder urban sprawl. Increasing travel costs combined with a more active spatial planning policy and a stronger cooperation between mobility policy and spatial planning can help to decrease car use and urban sprawl, but also change the way in which people perceive travel.

Unequal solar photovoltaic performance by race and income partly reflects financing models and installer choices,"Residential solar photovoltaics (PV) are important for a rapid decarbonization strategy. To chart an equitable energy transition, researchers have measured inequalities in residential PV adoption and identified factors that drive group disparities. We know little, however, about people's experiences after installing solar. Electricity generation differences among PV systems can be substantial and may contribute to inequitable outcomes even as adoption disparities wane. Here we use data measuring actual monthly generation for over 26,000 PV systems installed in Connecticut to identify significant disparities in system output by neighbourhood income and race. We show that the choice of financing model (purchase or leasing) partly explains the observed disparities. We also find that system generation varies significantly across installers, highlighting that firm behaviour contributes to inequitable outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of measuring the quality and the quantity of renewable energy projects to ensure an equitable energy transition.",About Sufficiency
"Urban biodiversity and social inequalities in built-up cities: New evidences, next questions. The example of Paris, France","The preservation of biodiversity, city-dwellers' quality of life and equality are major issues in promoting sustainable cities. We chose to work at the built-up and much-valued heart of an agglomeration: Paris. We attempt to verify whether public semi-natural spaces with spontaneous vegetation and green frames provide ecosystem services to city-dwellers in an equitable way, and what is the role played by urban landscapes in this relation. Based upon existing datasets, a spatial and statistical analysis of relationships between public semi-natural spaces, urban landscapes and socioeconomic profiles of households was carried out. We compare their spatial patterns, which vary considerably. Mean income per vegetal and landscape cluster and correlations between income, ecological parameters and building density show complex and non-linear relationships. According to Multiple Correspondence Analysis, clusters of public semi-natural spaces. floristic richness and ecological diversity are associated with specific household socioeconomic profiles and landscape design. In the western built-up Haussmann districts inhabited by well-off households, public semi natural spaces provide low ecosystem services. Conversely, in the eastern and peripheral quarters where lower-income households live, public semi-natural spaces provide higher ecosystem services. It is not only well-off households which benefit from being close to urban parks and waterways. Blue and green frames cross districts inhabited by different household profiles. The implications of such results on inequalities between city-dwellers depends whether the presence of public semi-natural spaces actually improves their quality of life. These results are highly significant at a time when urban planners are putting the city's Biodiversity Plan in place. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",About Sufficiency
"Urban containment policies and physical activity: A time-series analysis of metropolitan areas, 1990-2002","Background: Urban containment policies attempt to manage the location, character, and timing of growth to support a variety of goals such as compact development, preservation of greenspace, and efficient use of infrastructure. Despite prior research evaluating the effects of urban containment policies on land use, housing, and transportation outcomes, the public health implications of these policies remain unexplored. This ecologic study examines relationships among urban containment policies, state adoption of growthmanagement legislation, and population levels of leisure and transportation-related physical activity in 63 large metropolitan statistical areas from 1990 to 2002. Methods: Multiple data sources were combined, including surveys of urban containment policies, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the U.S. Census of Population, the National Resources Inventory, and the Texas Transportation Institute Urban Mobility Study. Mixed models were used to examine whether urban containment policies and state adoption of growth-management legislation were associated with population levels of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and walking/bicycling to work over time. Results: Strong urban containment policies were associated with higher population levels of LTPA and walking/bicycling to work during the study period. Additionally, residents of states with legislation mandating urban growth boundaries reported significantly more minutes of LTPA/week compared to residents of states without such policies. Weak urban containment policies showed inconsistent relationships with physical activity. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that strong urban containment policies are associated with higher population levels of LTPA and active commuting. Future research should examine potential synergies among state, metropolitan, and local policy processes that may strengthen these relationships.",About Sufficiency
Urban food security at the crossroads between metropolitan food planning and global trade: the case of the Antwerp-Rotterdam-Dusseldorf region,"Making use of Life Cycle Thinking, the Metropolitan Foodscape Planner (MFP) tool provides ecological footprint maps and supply/demand data showing a large potential for metropolitan food supplies. In the discussion, we examine these results in the light of recent research on the impacts of the prevailing global trade agro-food systems for the impact areas land use change, competition for space, biodiversity, and climate change, paying special attention to the Dutch approach toward global agro-food-chains. Finally, we put forward recommendations for developing sustainable foodscapes in metropolitan regions based on food-oriented spatial planning devices addressing aspects such as climate change, biodiversity, cross-border collaboration, food chain innovation, and footprint assessments.",About Sufficiency
Urban green and blue infrastructure: A critical analysis of research on developing countries,"This article reviews the current status of research on urban green and blue infrastructure (GBI) in developing countries. We critically analyzed a total of 283 papers addressing urban GBI in selected developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), published between 2015 and 2019. The review aimed to a) analyze publication trends and typologies of urban GBI; b) identify innovative problem-solving measures using urban GBI, and c) understand priorities, differences and similarities in the deployment of urban GBI between the regions. The article identifies a growing interest in the urban GBI concept in the Global South, with a focus on local sustainable development. Urban GBI aims to address issues of urban greenery, land use policies, food security and poverty alleviation. There is a large variation in the number of articles across regions, with Asia, and particularly China, as the subject having a much larger number of publications when compared to LAC and Africa. We found that the focus of research topics varied between regions, reflecting regional development needs, so that urban agriculture research predominated in Africa, and green spaces and parks in Asia and LAC. GBI is still not implemented as a low-impact development or innovative strategy, except in China, where researchers have examined several cases of systemic GBI use for addressing urban issues. More recently, studies began exploring the linkages between nature and cities in light of global environmental issues such as biodiversity loss and climate change. We conclude with recommendations to further examine empirical evidence of urban GBI deployment and its outcomes in the Global South, that could contribute toward conceptualizing natural resource management in a multi-scalar, multi-dimensional, and multidisciplinary framework.",About Sufficiency
Urban Land Expansion and Sustainable Land Use Policy in Shenzhen: A Case Study of China's Rapid Urbanization,"Shenzhen is a city that is highly representative of China's rapid urbanization process. As the city rapidly expands, there are enormous challenges to the sustainable use of land resources. This paper introduces the evolution of urban land expansion and the sustainable land use policy of the Shenzhen Government since 2005. The policy covers the reduction in rural-to-urban land conversion, the delineation of urban growth boundaries, arable land reclamation and the establishment of farmland protection areas, urban redevelopment, and the investigation and prosecution of illegal construction. This paper considers the aspects of urbanization and land management systems that are unique to China. The current top-down indicative and mandatory mode of control, which relies on the central government, has very limited effects. Good results were achieved in Shenzhen for the following elements: governmental self-restraint, governmental identity change, and policy innovation.

"Urban nature-based solutions planning for biodiversity outcomes: human, ecological, and artificial intelligence perspectives","Nature-based solutions (NBS) harness ecosystem services for urban enhancement, promoting biodiversity, habitat creation, and water management while improving human well-being. However, decision-making often favours specific NBS designs, leading to uneven benefits distribution. Whereas human-centric NBS design relies on convenience, financial sustainability, historical aspects, and amenity increase through NBS technical solutions, flora- and fauna-centric (or eco-centric) design targets spatial connectedness of blue-green spaces, increase in species richness, and habitat within urban centres. Both approaches can shape the urban biodiversity landscape, yet; they often clash around planning priorities. Recent advances in AI offer potential for AI-centric urban planning, though its role remains unclear. This study examines the interplay between biodiversity and NBS planning across human-, eco-, and AI-centric domains, aiming for balanced urban outcomes. We blended narrative, integrative, and systematic literature review and propose future steps for more balanced NBS development. The findings of this work suggest that AI presents an opportunity for a more balanced NBS design through its applications in climate change prediction, water management, and project visualisation. Incorporating AI into urban planning tools can expedite modelling process, improve stakeholder communication, and enhance project outcomes visualisation. By integrating human, eco, and AI-centric approaches, urban planners can foster resilience and sustainability in NBS implementation, ensuring equitable distribution of benefits across urban landscapes.",About Sufficiency
"URBAN ROADS AND SOCIAL METABOLISM: A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY FOR SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO","The present work explores the relationship between an urban road with both, socio-metabolic processes and natural systems patterns. The premise is that roads have a decisive impact on energy, material flows and connectivity between biological structures. Therefore, urban metabolism - Social and natural processes measured out of energy use, material flows and land use - becomes the appropriate instrument to assess and analyze the functionality of the different components operating in artificial and natural systems. The case study traces the metabolic behaviors that result from the cross of Juan Ponce de Leon Avenue through the water system composed by the estuary of Martin Pena and Rio Piedras River. A theoretical framework based on social equity, economy, and ecology is being applied in data collection and analysis. Parametric methodologies and GIS information are used to describe the structural and functional properties of both natural and urban systems. The collected data enable the understanding that the simultaneous loss of energy efficiency and land-use efficiency from the mid-20th century to the present affects the resilience of the area. Consequently, this exploration demonstrates the importance of urban metabolism in maintaining the ecological quality of natural systems. As a result, it proposes an urban metabolism strategy to develop more sustainable urban schemes for the systems composed of urban roads and natural ecosystems. The organized complexity of the water system, necessary to host biodiversity and fundamental ecological processes, cannot be guaranteed if the urban metabolism is not taken into account.",About Sufficiency
Urban sustainability in Caribbean Small Island Developing States: a conceptual framework for urban planning using a case study of Trinidad,"Urban planners in the Caribbean have long advocated for a resolution of conflicts between built development and the environment. They have grappled with challenges of small geographic size, an increasingly urbanised landscape and the need to facilitate urban centres as engines of economic development and as the loci of prosperity. This article investigates the urban planning community's perspective with respect to the drivers of unsustainable urbanisation and provides a conceptual framework for urban planning to attain urban sustainability in a small island developing state context. Trinidad is used as a case study. The research found that urbanisation has been inadequately regulated despite a plethora of legislation, urban plans and policies, and that the political will to achieve urban sustainability is lacking. This has resulted in ecosystem damage, economic losses and the undermining of human well-being. The article concludes that urban planning needs a conceptual framework to move centre stage and a steadfast political will is paramount in achieving urban sustainability in the Caribbean.",About Sufficiency
"Urbanization moderates the transitional linkages between energy resource use, greenhouse gas emissions, socio-economic and human development: from subnational in China","Sustainable energy use and management are key to improving human well-being, while rapid urbanization intersecting with economic development makes it challenging. Extensive cross-national analyses on this topic can inform the global agenda; however, far fewer subnational explorations consider the impact of urbanization in moderating the relationships between energy resource use, greenhouse gas emissions, socio-economic and human development. Therefore, this research analyzed Chinese subnational data from 2000 to 2019 to reveal the dynamic relationship between energy use and objective human well-being and explored how urbanization moderated the transitional linkages from energy use to economic development to human need satisfiers and to human well-being. This research found a diminishing return from energy use (both primary energy extraction and final energy use) to the Human Development Index (HDI) from 2000 to 2019. Moreover, in later years, there was neither a linear correlation nor a log-linear relationship between energy use and HDI at the subnational level. In contrast, HDI was consistently strongly correlated with GDP per capita and household income at the subnational level in China over time. Two distinct energy-GDP pathways, i.e., high energy use-low GDP and low energy use-high GDP, were observed at the subnational level, which explained why the log-linear relationship between HDI and energy use/GHGs diminished over time. Urbanization level had a significant moderating impact on the linkages between human need satisfiers and HDI, as well as life expectancy. Subnational policies should prioritize different human need satisfiers in different urbanization periods.",About Sufficiency
Impact of urban facilities spatial inequality on sustainable travel mode,"With the implementation of sustainable development objectives in developing countries, urban planning, land use regulation, and urban mobility policies are expected to help reduce inequalities in access to urban facilities. Urban transport policies are also expected to encourage travel by non-motorised modes and public transport. These are considered to be the sustainable modes of urban transport. In this paper, we investigate how inequality of urban facilities impacts trips made by sustainable modes in the city of Santiago de Chile. We use a Poisson regression model and its geographical extension, the geographically weighted Poisson regression model (GWPR). The results suggest that the inequality of urban facilities impacts trips made by sustainable modes. The variables with the highest relevance are the spatial distribution of mixed land use, the spatial distribution of urban services related to transport infrastructure, primary and secondary education, as well as the spatial distribution of demographic variables related to people’s life cycle.",About Sufficiency
US urban land-use reform: a strategy for energy sufficiency,"Policy approaches to the global energy transition often focus on technology-based solutions while ignoring challenges of overall energy demand. A sufficiency-first approach aims to limit superfluous consumption while achieving wellbeing for all. This study focuses on US built environment mechanisms of sufficiency under urban land-use policy. The historical context of US exclusionary and car-oriented planning is reviewed with an order- of-magnitude assessment of the effects on greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). Using national vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) data derived from mobile device locations (Replica) and validated here with federal data, a hypothetical scenario explores the potential for state urban land-use reforms to enable energy sufficiency. Tenth percentile-VMT (per capita) neighborhoods are defined by state: in 47 states, the typical such neighborhood has less than 33% of its housing units in structures larger than four units. Assuming each state redresses its housing shortage while matching this VMT, 31 Mt CO(2)e (direct GHGE) and about 38 Mt CO(2)e (indirect and life-cycle GHGE) would be avoided in 2033. Texas, California, and Florida have the largest absolute emissions reduction opportunity. Urban land-use reforms comprise a logical starting point for a US sufficiency agenda.

Using weighted entropy to measure the recyclability of municipal solid waste in China: Exploring the geographical disparity for circular economy,"Solid waste recycling in developing countries has been largely relying on the informal recycling sector which intelligently uses the tacit knowledge within the hierarchical network of labor division to capture the value from the geographically uneven distribution of waste generation and demands on secondary materials. Previous studies on solid waste recycling mainly have a material-centric view on economic value. In this paper, an entropy-weighted recyclability index (EWRI) is developed to quantify the recyclability of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in China at the prefectural city level by integrating the road transportation density and regional recycling capability into the categories of waste physical components regarding the cost to deliver the waste from generating sources to the conversion sites for recycling. The result confirms the existence of an east-west gradient regional disparity in recyclability of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) among cities for the recyclable components. The 339 prefectural cities were classified into 4 grades, namely ""best, good, normal, and difficult"" for the recyclability of local MSW with guidelines for planning of regional recycling infrastructure, respectively.

DETERMINANTS OF RESIDENTIAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION: A CASE STUDY OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES,"Urban landscape has faced with substantial social, economic and environmental challenges due to uncontrolled growth of cities and regions during the past century. The unprecedented demographic growth and the consequent changes in the landscape give rise to extensive sustainability challenges such as ecosystem degradation, loss of agricultural and natural land resources, and shortage or unequal distribution of water resources and associated infrastructure. Cities and urban regions can be considered as one of the key sources of energy resources consumption and significant contributors to greenhouse gases emissions due to inefficiency of built environment and transportation activities. Energy consumption reduction and the use of renewable energy sources are recognized as governmental priorities in the context of green economy and sustainable development. In the recent decades, research and policy analysis are mainly centered on reduction of energy consumption and mitigation of environmental degradation. However, the literature on socio-economic and spatial determinants of non-renewable energy consumption in the European Union (EU) countries is scarce. The literature focuses on either non-spatial determinants of energy consumption or spatial determinants were considered at the country level and there are few studies utilizing the regions as the unit of analysis. Therefore, the study aims at quantifying and analyzing the spatial determinants of non-renewable residential energy consumption at the NUTS3 (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) regional level in the EU countries (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/history) for a better understanding of the determinants of energy consumption and its policy implications.",About Sufficiency
Visions for climate neutrality and opportunities for co-learning in European cities,"Cities represent unique spaces for climate mitigation where wide-ranging action to reduce emissions meets ambition and collaboration. This research work distils climate neutrality narratives for 362 cities that expressed interest in the European Mission on 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities and focuses on the 112 cities selected to spearhead the process of reaching climate neutrality by 2030 (representing a mitigation potential of 318.3 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions). The method involves steps that profile the characteristics of these cities, enunciate cross-cutting patterns in cities' visions by thematic groupings, and compare 14 contextual factors with 77 possible main barriers. There are both similarities and differences among the results as a basis for learning together and certain barriers can be relatively more dominant in some thematic groupings, such as fragmentation of responsibilities. As a synthesis of the main findings, the original analyses are used to derive and prioritise nine high-level recommendations based on the cities' visions, contextual factors, and expected main barriers. Opportunities for mobilising transformative change relate to transforming siloed into integrated approaches, inclusive climate governance and collaborations, innovative financing, welfare and just transition as well as planning, implementation, and policy coherence.

For increasing urban populations, green???blue infrastructure (GBI) is an important element in compact cities contributing to human health, well-being, and the provision of important ecosystem services. We analyzed responses from two open-ended questions about visions, ideas, and topics for the development and management of GBI important for citizens of the city of Leipzig, Germany. The questions were part of an online survey accompanying the development of the local GBI planning strategy: Master Plan Green. The strategy is focusing on five guiding themes that are leading local and global debates about sustainable and resilient cities: biodiversity, climate adaptation, environmental justice, health, and sustainable mobility. We categorize citizens' ideas and suggestions, summarize frequent problems and conflicts, and link ideas and visions to the five guiding themes. As the last step, we discuss citizens' suggestions in order to minimize conflicts in GBI and to identify deficits in present local planning. Major problems and conflicts that were addressed by respondents relate to quality, usability, other users, activities, and safety and security of GBI. Numerous suggestions aimed to tackle these problems, for example, by designating separate use areas, adding naturalness, improving maintenance, and enhancing facilities. A range of ideas and suggestions were based on diverging expectations underpinning the challenge of matching heterogeneous demands of GBI users in an equitable fashion. Linking these suggestions to the five guiding themes reveals that most ideas are covered by one or several guiding themes and are considered in local planning strategies. However, findings also demonstrate that increasing the quantity of Leipzig's GBI is a central request from respondents. Sociocultural and economic aspects as well as conflicting demands among citizens should further be central to GBI planning to avoid injustice and achieve sustainability objectives. This analysis gives insights into opinions and visions of citizens regarding the development of the city's GBI network and thus substantiates major strategic and planning themes leading global and local urban strategies toward sustainable cities. Considering specific suggestions and GBI deficits that bother citizens on a local level, offers the opportunity to improve the social and ecological resilience of GBI.",About Sufficiency
Assessment of the Impact of Road Transport Change on the Security of the Urban Social Environment,"In the context of accelerating urbanisation, cities must ensure a viable economy, social well-being, and a healthy environment. Transport is one of the key conditions for economic development and meeting the needs of countries, regions, and cities. However, transport must meet not only the physiological but also the social needs of society, one of which is environmental security. Urban transport accounts for around 40% of CO2 emissions and 70% of other pollutants from road transport. Thus, one of the most difficult issues for any city to address when building bypasses is the growing number of cars in the city, traffic congestion, and the reduction of all greenhouse gas emissions. The documents adopted in July 2020 aim to revitalise the EU’s economy by moving towards a green economy and sustainability. In addition to the systematic and comparative analysis of concepts published in the scientific literature, the article also presents an analysis of the concepts of the sustainable city and sustainable transport, as well as a study of the social impact of bypasses and the assessment of the security of the social environment in the Baltic capitals. The aim of the article is to assess the impact of the growing number of vehicles on the security of the city’s social environment.

"Impact of urban expansion on carbon storage under multi-scenario simulations in Wuhan, China","Abstract Carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, which is the basis of the global carbon cycle, reflects the changes in the environment due to anthropogenic impacts. Rapid and effective assessment of the impact of urban expansion on carbon reserves is vital for the sustainable development of urban ecosystems. Previous studies on future scenario simulations lacked research regarding the driving factors of changes in carbon storages within urban expansion, and the economic value accounting for changes in carbon storages. Therefore, this study examined Wuhan, China, and explored the latent effects of urban expansion on terrestrial carbon storage by combining the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) and Patch-generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model. Based on different socioeconomic strategies, we developed three future scenarios, including Baseline Scenario (BS), Cropland Protection Scenario (CP) and Ecological protection Scenario (EP), to predict the urban built-up land use change from 2015 to 2035 in Wuhan and discussed the carbon storage impacts of urban expansion. The result shows that (1) Wuhan’s urban built-up land area expanded 2.67 times between 1980 and 2015, which is approximately 685.17 km2 and is expected to continuously expand to 1349–1945.01 km2 by 2035. (2) Urban expansion in Wuhan has caused carbon storage loss by 5.12 × 106 t during 1980–2015 and will lead to carbon storage loss by 6.15 × 106 t, 4.7 × 106 t and 4.05 × 106 t under BS, CP, and EP scenarios from 2015 to 2035, accounting for 85.42%, 81.74%, and 78.79% of the total carbon loss, respectively. (3) The occupation of cropland by urban expansion is closely related to the road system expansion, which is the main driver of carbon storage reduction from 2015 to 2035. (4) We expect that by 2035, the districts facing carbon loss caused by the growth of urban built-up land will expand outward around secondary roads, and the scale of outward expansion under various scenarios will be ranked as BS > CP > EP. In combination, the InVEST and the PLUS model can assess the impact of urban expansion on carbon storage more efficiently and is conducive to carrying out urban planning and promoting a dynamic balance between urban economic development and human well-being.",About Sufficiency
Waste as Resource for Pakistan: An Innovative Business Model of Regenerative Circular Economy to Integrate Municipal Solid Waste Management Sector,"Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a global concern, especially in low-middle-income countries such as Pakistan, which require the redressal of MSW treatment issues to attain sustainability in the waste sector. The prosperity of municipal solid waste (MSW) collectors, i.e., the sanitary workers, is critical in the waste management hierarchy. Hence, the health, safety, social welfare, economic conditions and overall wellbeing of this tier need to be focused on more. Safeguarding the interests of the sanitary workers will support the MSW management sector in sustainability, which will help to generate revenue and minimize climatic impacts. An innovative MSW business model with waste ownership and technological intervention has excellent potential to support the sector towards a circular economy in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, generating about 100,000 metric tons of MSW per day. The proposed recycling business model will ensure a daily material recovery of 26,070 tons with 4721 tons of compost manufacturing in the country, which ultimately helps towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and meeting the targets of nationally determined contributors (NDCs) by 2030.

Under-resourced and marginalized community members are vulnerable to disproportionate burdens of the energy system, particularly in postindustrial cities also grappling with social pressures associated with disinvestment and deindustrialization, climate change threats, and pressures of urban renewal. In this study, we use expert elicitation, ethnographic participant observation, and community focus groups to examine issues and conceptualizations of energy justice in a minority-majority post-industrial city undergoing rapid energy transformation alongside gentrification and other changing community dynamics. Building on community partnerships with NGOs, our team has worked closely with a previously defined ""environmental justice"" community to elicit the ways in which the energy transition is perceived to result in energy justice and injustice by energy system specialists and by community members. We find that community members in particular fear getting ""priced out"" of their community as energy system upgrades are implemented, and also feel that systemic injustices such as racialized governance structures would be exacerbated. We also identify the ways that energy justice is conceptualized whereby community members identify co-benefits such as improved housing, lower pollution, and an opportunity for energy democracy as possible outcomes of the energy transition. We offer concrete takeaways about the value of ethnographic energy justice research in partnership with communities and the application of energy justice frameworks that can be heeded by researchers and policymakers alike.",About Sufficiency

The Effect of Building Electricity Consumption on Residents’ Subjective Well-Being: Evidence from China,"Residential electricity consumption has an important impact on China’s construction of a low-carbon society. However, at present, little of the literature analyzes the influencing factors of residents’ overall well-being from the perspective of micro investigation. Based on the micro mixed cross section data of the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS), this paper empirically studies the impact of residential electricity consumption on residents’ subjective well-being. In addition, in the heterogeneity analysis, we found that an increase in residential electricity consumption will improve the overall well-being of females and people with low levels of education, but it has no significant effect on males and people with high levels of education. Moreover, the increase in residential electricity consumption has improved the life satisfaction of young people and middle-aged people. Meanwhile, the increase in residential electricity consumption has a significant, positive impact on both low-income and high-income households. Further analysis shows that no nonlinear relationship exists between the increase in residents’ power consumption and the improvement in life satisfaction.

By 2021, the coordination degree value has reached 0.6656, which is in a relatively coordinated state.",About Sufficiency
Sustainable Urban Resource Management an Analytical Framework,"Conference Title: 2024 6th International Conference on Computing and Informatics (ICCI)Conference Start Date: 2024, March 6 Conference End Date: 2024, March 7 Conference Location: New Cairo - Cairo, EgyptImplementing comprehensive and environmentally sensitive solutions to maximize resource utilization in urban environments is the essence of sustainable urban resource management. The main features and advantages of sustainable urban resource management are examined in this abstract. Cities are becoming more aware of the need to implement sustainable practices that reduce their negative effects on the environment and increase their overall resilience because of the fast urbanization trend. By combining several components—such as garbage, energy, water, and green spaces—sustainable urban resource management promotes a circular economy and reduces the environmental impact of urban growth. To improve the quality of the air and water, this strategy places a strong emphasis on utilizing resources efficiently, supporting renewable energy sources, and implementing green infrastructure. Cities may concurrently solve environmental concerns, improve social well-being, and spur economic growth by placing a high priority on sustainable practices. This abstract explores the various facets of sustainable urban resource management, highlighting how it can lead to the development of more resilient, habitable, and environmentally friendly urban environments. The Egyptian government started a comprehensive national initiative called the Hayaa Karima “Decent Life Initiative” in Egypt. Through the resolution of several socioeconomic issues and the advancement of sustainable development, it seeks to enhance the standard of living for residents in rural areas. To circulate the advancements in the public and local sectors, we will present in this search an analytical framework linked to key performance indicators for the main results of Hayaa Karima's initiatives as an internal audit.",About Sufficiency
Efficiency of green and low-carbon coordinated development for mega urban agglomerations: an empirical study,"As a critical engine for national economic growth, mega urban agglomerations have significant scale effects and economic and environmental spillover effects. This paper aims to study the green and low-carbon coordinated development of mega urban agglomerations to evaluate the country's level of ecological civilization and its green and low-carbon development. The traditional research on green and low-carbon urban development tends to homogenize the redistribution theme, leading to significant errors in spatial allocation. This results in a lower accuracy of spatial distribution calculations for green development. Additionally, the research is constrained by data precision and methodology, making it challenging to measure the spatial differences in green and low-carbon development within urban clusters at the block level. This limitation hinders the ability to conduct detailed studies on the efficiency variations of green and low-carbon development in urban clusters.To achieve this aim, the study adopts the DPSR framework of the economic, resource, social, and ecological environment complex system and focuses on the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in China. The study uses the entropy method, Gini coefficient method, and non-expected output super-efficiency SBM model to analyze the spatial effects and development efficiency of green and low-carbon development in this region from 2006 to 2020. The study results indicate that: (1) the overall level of green and low-carbon development in the Greater Bay Area is on the rise, with Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Foshan, and Zhuhai showing more stable development than other cities.(2) The spatial differences in the region's level of green and low-carbon development have narrowed trends, mainly due to differences between regions. (3) The overall development efficiency of green and low-carbon in the Greater Bay Area is on the rise, with Guangzhou region showing overall stability, and Shenzhen region and Zhuhai region experiencing multiple ups and downs in their development. The three sub-regions show significant differences, but the balance and coordination of development have significantly improved. The study achieves a balance between the opportunity effects of green and low-carbon development and environmental policy constraints in super large urban clusters, effectively enhancing resource utilization efficiency in these clusters.",About Sufficiency
Spatiotemporal Evolution and Rank–Size Pattern of Chinese Urban Settlements,"Accurate and timely urban boundaries can effectively quantify the spatial characteristics of urban evolution and are essential for understanding the impacts of urbanization processes and land-use changes on the environment and biodiversity. Currently, there is a lack of long time-series, high-resolution, nationally consistent Chinese urban boundary data for urban research. In this study, the city clustering algorithm was used to generate urban settlement boundaries in China based on the local density, size, and spatial relationships of impervious surfaces. The results showed that both the area and the number of urban settlements in China revealed an upward trend from 1985 to 2020, with East China (EC) being much higher than other regions and South China showing the most significant growth rate. The average area ratio of urban green space in China was 41.68%, with the average area ratio in EC being higher than in other regions. Meanwhile, Zipf’s law was used to verify the universality of urban settlement rank–size; the changes in the Zipf index from 1985 to 2020 also revealed that China’s urban size tended to be concentrated, and the development of large urban settlements was relatively prominent. The urban definition method we propose in this study can divide urban boundaries efficiently and accurately, identify urban expansion hotspots, and promote research on farmland loss and ecological land degradation, further exploring the impacts of urbanization on food security, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. By coupling big data such as economy, energy, and population with urban evolution patterns, urban managers can analyze current and future problems in urban development, thereby providing scientific decision-making for urban sustainability.",About Sufficiency
