AB  - Introduction: Food service establishments in Malaysia have grown positively in response to the rising demand for dining out and takeaway food. However, they also exert a high demand for energy resources and contribute to negative environmental impacts. In this study, an environmental assessment of food waste generation was carried out alongside carbon footprint quantification across electricity and water consumption in two different food service establishments with a focus on cafeterias and casual dining restaurants. Methods: Ten food premises with the same criteria in service were selected, consisting of cafeterias and Thai food restaurants located in Kelantan state of Malaysia. Food waste from preparation losses, serving losses and plate waste were collected and measured for a 7-day period to establish respective quantities. Material Flow Analysis (MFA) was used to visualize the material flow from the operation of both the cafeterias and Thai food restaurants while carbon footprint analysis was undertaken to calculate carbon emissions. Results: The findings revealed consistent results for both the cafeterias and Thai food restaurants as higher proportions of food waste arose from customer plate waste (67.99% and 62.12%) rather than preparation losses (32.01% and 37.88%). It was identified that cafeterias contribute larger volumes of carbon emissions for both electricity (105.93 kgCO2e) and water related consumption (8.39 kgCO2e) compared to Thai food restaurants (57.58 kgCO2e and 3.63 kgCO2e). Conclusion: These findings may provide guidance for the food service management to recognize the priority areas of improvement in reducing environmental impact associated food service sector. © 2022 UPM Press.

AB  - Globally, climate-related disasters (CRDs) have become a common phenomenon in the last few decades, increasing vulnerability and causing disaster mortality. To manage disaster risk, the global Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction (SFDRR) provides a solid action plan for disaster risk reduction (DRR) considering all the dimensions of vulnerability. However, countries are still less receptive at the local level to adopting the SFDRR. Also, the global research community did not explore vulnerability features based on the Sendai Framework nor integrated such features with the four priorities of SFDRR. Based on the case of Pakistan, this study seeks to bridge the gap through three objectives. The first objective of the study is to identify the vulnerability features cited in the SFDRR. In addition, the research aims to develop a new vulnerability model by integrating SFDRR's four priorities. As a second objective, it is intended to develop a decision support framework for ranking and evaluating each of the SFDRR priority action areas under local conditions. A third objective is to assess the impact of climate-induced environmental, socioeconomic and political vulnerabilities on climate-driven mortality. To meet these three different objectives, the authors have adopted a multi-method approach by using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and binary logistic regression method (BLRM). Based on the assessment, the authors suggested some policy implications. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Management of sustainable transportation currently is one of the most important aspects of a country's or a region's development from an economic and social point of view considering the net zero requirements The use of electric vehicles (EVs) is recognized as an essential means of achieving global net-zero emission goals. To promote their widespread adoption, the challenges they face must be addressed. These challenges are divided into several categories: infrastructure, adoption, costs, energy transition, awareness, and market-related challenges. Robust regulatory frameworks and incentive policies must be implemented to overcome most of these challenges. For EV adoption to increase rapidly and steadily, such frameworks must include fiscal and non-fiscal incentives that will encourage the masses to convert to EVs. The key findings of the work include identification of several barrier not widely discussed in the literature, emphasizing the need for non-fiscal incentives for EV adoption, and presenting a comprehensive analysis of various incentive policies alongside a detailed implementation framework. The implementation framework provides research directions for academics, engineers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders regarding further refinement and enhancement of policy incentives to facilitate the widespread adoption of EVs. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Local governments are expected now more than ever to lead climate action planning as climate change intensifies and urbanization increases rapidly. However, studies indicate limitations in the comprehensiveness and level of integration of adaptation and mitigation in existing climate action plans. To develop suitable climate action plans that are comprehensive and consistent with globally accepted standards and benchmarks, this study proposed an Urban Climate Action Planning framework and pilot-tested it with 257 urban climate action plans. Overall, 43 criteria are included in the framework across three stages of climate planning. The pilot test revealed that more than half of the sampled plans have a medium level of suitability, with 39% having a weak level of suitability. About 51% of plans from Europe have a weak level of suitability. Surprisingly, none of the plans sampled from Africa and Latin America achieved a weak level of suitability despite lacking a significant share of global climate research and development funding. A Kruskal-Wallis test shows a statistically significant association between stages of climate planning and (a) city types (p-value of 0.004326) and (b) year of adoption or publication of climate plans and suitability scores (p-value of 0.0001027). Urban climate action plans adopted or published more recently (2018–2022) are likely more suitable than those adopted or published earlier. The sampled urban climate action plans from the Global South had higher average suitability scores than those from the Global North. The study presents key findings and considerations for urban climate action planning and future research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions is substantially altering water availability while increasing water demand. Shifts in domestic energy policy and production, while needed to confront the challenge of climate change, may further stress the nation's water resources. These changes and new demands will be most severe in regions that are already experiencing water stresses and conflicts. This article examines the extent of the changes in water supply and demand by assessing how water conflicts will be addressed in the four overarching water use categories: water for population security, water for ecological security, water for energy security, and water for food security. The analysis suggests that water governance institutions and policies need to be retooled to better accommodate the necessary reallocation of water that will serve the nation's water security needs.

AB  - The increase in worldwide population is putting much pressure on the existent urban management plans. In this context, strategies and policies should be updated to conserve natural resources, but more importantly, to improve inhabitants' well-being. Studies focusing on pervious areas have many potentials, particularly regarding the assessment of potential green infrastructures within the vicinities of cities. This study highlights the pervious area change between 2001 and 2016 within every county in the CONtiguous United States (CONUS) based on the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The study found that 43 different counties can be considered dense. A statistical analysis is followed, highlighting the air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, solar radiation, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trends in five characteristic counties. These datasets were retrieved from diverse remote sensing and satellite platforms between 1980 and 2019. The main results also found that air temperature was significantly (at α = 0.95) increasing for the same period. The other climatic variables depict fluctuating and usually insignificant trends. Such information would benefit decision- and policy-makers to focus their initiatives towards the most vulnerable counties while projecting different scenarios based on their current and historical conditions. Furthermore, this approach can be portable to other countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to present a practical model of strategic waste management via two Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threats (SWOT) models and hierarchical analysis. In this regard, the strengths and weaknesses of the present situation and the factors affecting waste management in Tehran were investigated. In this study, the importance of public participation in waste management was investigated by means of the Delphi method and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). Based on the results of the SWOT analysis, a team of experts identified the internal and external factors and rated the primary factors; each factor was weighted, then according to their scores, the proposed waste management framework was developed. Finally, the strategies were quantitatively prioritized by the planning matrix. Then, using the analysis method, the hierarchy was used in this study as a SWOT supplement. The results of two questionnaires designed in this study identified the socio-economic, educational, cultural, and political factors as first to fourth, respectively. The most viable strategies, which were selected based on the analysis, include the potential use of social networks to encourage society to reduce waste and to promote the separation of waste as well as compliance with the proposed comprehensive waste management program; another choice strategy was providing economic incentives to maximize social participation in reducing waste production waste sorting. © 2019, Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology.

AB  - This book reviews the key conceptions and economic theories of poverty, explains poverty-environment nexus, and finally offers innovative socio-economic and scientific geospatial solutions for the 21st Century. The book makes it possible for our readers to understand poverty thorough a concise review of the major theoretical economic frameworks, measures of poverty, and points out the need to understand rural-urban dichotomy of poverty. We find the theories and measures to be less-than perfect and therefore point out the need to treat these measures and theories as convenient tools lacking perfect accuracy and utmost scientific reliability. It follows then that the supposedly knowledgeably crafted poverty reduction and environmental preservation solutions are inherently imperfect. The economic solutions proposed in this book transcend extant humdrum macroeconomic and policy measures targeting poverty and environmental issues. We point to a new paradigm in which private sector and other stakeholders can create new and inclusive markets where value is co-created and shared. Above all, this book offers timely state-of-the-art geospatial solutions targeting the most pressing global problems of water, e.g., the use of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) missions to estimate changes in stored water in the water-poverty-environment nexus, pollution, agriculture and disaster management, where geospatial techniques are applied under strong environmental impact assessment regulatory regimes. "This book provides a good summary of economic theories of poverty as well as a vivid depiction of the state of environmental degradation in the world. People often work separately on different issues that are, in fact, closely intertwined. The principle of holism is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and I believe that this joint-venture of two experts on poverty and environment has produced something more than a sum of two separate monographs on the issues. Various points raised in this volume are worth heeding when we think of formulation and implementation of a truly effective post-MDGs development agenda.

AB  - In today’s world, where urbanization is at its pinnacle, has created a significant economic gap between rural and urban populations in developing economies and substantially influenced environmental degradation. This study investigates the relationship between urbanization and environmental degradation via carbon emissions among developing countries along the Belt and Road route from 1990 to 2019 while using economic production, energy consumption, and trade openness as control variables. The study engages current econometric methodologies to uncover accurate and reliable findings, and the outcomes reveal that the panel under investigation is cross-sectionally dependent and heterogeneous. Therefore, the AMG, CCEMG, and DCCEMG estimators are employed to examine the effect connection between the variables. The outcomes unveil that urbanization, economic production, and energy consumption escalate environmental degradation, but trade openness is confirmed as a trivial determinant of environmental degradation. Furthermore, the causal connections between the variables disclose bi-directional causalities between urbanization and environmental degradation and between energy consumption and environmental degradation. Nevertheless, uni-directional causalities are affirmed, spanning from economic production to environmental degradation and from trade openness to environmental degradation. Finally, policy implications are discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The former consensus on a link between energy consumption and improved well-being of a country has been scrutinized by scholars for decades and is, succinctly, for the time being a contested thesis. Until the 1970s the relation of energy to well-being was defined as linearly proportional, and in a later period still as an increasing logarithmic function. Recent empirical research falsified the assumption of an overt link between well-being and increased energy consumption in countries with high per-capita energy usage. Going forward, our research shows for the first time a possible proof for a negative correlation between energy consumption and well-being after a Well-being Turning Point (WTP). We used a world data set, not limited to high-income countries but including 176 nations with available data sets. Our findings could support both the logarithmic growth of well-being together with energy, as well as the contradicting saturation theses supporting degrowth, and thus opens the discussion in all directions. In this paper Energy Footprint data within Eora database and Global Multi Regional Input Output methodology have been calculated, which includes also the energy embodied in imported/exported products and services (also known as consumption-based energy accounts). The use of footprint accounts has been demonstrated in our previous research to be necessary when analysing global energy consumption trends; as it records the energy consumption reality better than the usually used Total Primary Energy Supply which is provided by the International Energy Agency. In this paper, we provide in a novel way, some statistical support for an Energy WTP, i.e. a high-energy threshold after which a further consumption increase results in a reduced Human Development Index. We tested our results for possible biases (e.g. excluding outlier countries and including a factor for considering the weight of high population countries) and concluded that a WTP is one possible interpretation of the data. Thus, we would like to open a discussion about how energy consumption could end up having a negative effect on well-being, considering its indirect impacts in citizens of a country.

AB  - The environmental and energy factor is one of the important factors that most studies have focused on in the field of sustainability, especially in light of the increasing population growth rates and the accompanying increase in consumption and environmental pollution rates. This paper focuses on presenting several different theories and models of urban sustainability for the purpose of identifying the overall factors that constitute it. Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) allows knowledge of the relationships and the strength of influence between these factors. The paper focuses on studying the environmental and energy factors and their impact on other sustainability factors. As most researchers resort to descriptive methods and measures in discussing the subject. The paper aims to adopt models and quantitative measures to determine the factors and indicators of urban sustainability and to clarify the importance, variation, and interdependence between these factors and indicators, adopting the hypothesis that structural equation modeling provides highly reliable tools through which sustainability factors, their relationships, and the mutual influence between them can be measured using the analysis of moment structures (AMOS) program. The result shows that the environmental and energy factors are highly related to the urban design factor (6.0). © 2023 by the authors. Licensee C.E.J, Tehran, Iran.

AB  - Accelerated urbanization, population growth, and industrial revolution have resulted in significant environmental degradation and health issues for residents due to municipal solid waste. The effective management of solid waste is a significant issue, especially in developing economies, where improper waste disposal leads to economic losses and adverse impacts on environmental and public health. This study evaluates existing waste management procedures in Tabuk City in northern Saudi Arabia, finds significant challenges, and suggests possible solutions. For this purpose, this study administered a survey to assess public awareness regarding municipal solid waste recycling and management. Therefore, a two-stage analytic investigation was conducted that included a total of 228 respondents from Tabuk City, Saudi Arabia. Among them, 62.28% were male, and 37.72% were female, with the largest age group represented was 22–35 years, accounting for 42.10% of participants. The questionnaire responses were evaluated using SPSS V27, and relative scores were analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations and Partial Dependence Plots. Based on the study results, most respondents are knowledgeable and worried about the adverse environmental effects of solid waste. The Pearson correlation highlighted that lack of awareness with responsible authorities exhibited the highest positive correlations with recycling behavior improvement, with respective correlation values of + 0.55. The results also revealed an absence of recycling systems since the majority of respondents were uninformed of existing practices and expressed a readiness to engage in recycling programs if established. Further, parametric modeling illustrates that most of the participants believe that lack of awareness along with authority responsibility is the most influential factor impacting poor waste management practice. The study concluded by highlighting the necessity for an organized municipal solid waste recycling system, enhanced community education, and more stringent governmental restrictions to mitigate environmental damage and foster sustainable waste management in Tabuk. © The Author(s) 2025.

The achievement of the sustainable development goals has made necessary to develop a system of indicators. Indicators and data should be collected and reported sub-nationally, giving attention to the territory. This is a necessity even more for Italy, a country historically characterized by strong regional specificities and differences, which find their radicalization in the so-called North–South gap. In this paper, we want to examine and monitor the Italian situation as to the achievement of the SDGs, based on the analysis of the Regions, to highlight potential differences or territorial homogeneity. In particular, we want to emphasize not only how there is actually a gap between the North and the South of the country, but also how the synthesis tends often to be representative of situations profoundly different from each other, as a result of different values in the basic indicators, or similar situations between them. Due to the difficulty of reporting on a paper a detailed analysis of all 17 sustainable development goals, we focus only on the first three goals one. In particular, for each goal we select indicators all useful for the analysis of regional realities and appropriate some for monitoring the present condition, others for providing information on the future one (risk). The research methodology is to use the Adjusted Mazziotta–Pareto Index for creating a composite index for each goal considered. This analysis is preceded by an exploratory analysis of the basic indicators over time through the use of within and between correlations and the average PCA. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Urban areas are facing the risk of climate change due to high temperatures, floods, storms, droughts, and the expected rise in sea levels, as a result of the rapid growth in urban and industrial activities. Cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are primarily exposed to the effects of high heat and floods after rare events of heavy rainfall. This requires the search for sustainable and appropriate planning solutions to adapt to climate change within the framework of sustainable urban planning. Urban planning can play a significant role in addressing climate change through sustainable adaptation. Therefore, the research aims to study and identify appropriate environmental tools and planning approaches that can be integrated into the urban planning methodology to adapt to climate change in urban areas in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Some case studies of urban areas exposed to the risk of climate change were studied and analyzed to evaluate the planning tools and approaches adopted to confront these risks. five cases were studied. The challenges and positives of these tools and approaches were deduced. The appropriate planning approach has been selected for the privacy of Saudi cities to face the effects of climate change. The research concluded that sponge cities are the appropriate approach for Saudi cities to face the risks of floods. The suitability of the sponge cities was assessed in comparison with the case of floods in Jeddah city, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The research also reached steps to integrate the requirements of converting to spongy cities in the urban planning methodology at the different planning levels © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The false hope that economic development would lead to a decrease in fossil sources’ energy consumption can be an obstacle to fighting global warming. Is it realistic to expect that more knowledge will lead public policymakers to take more decisive action to mitigate climate change's adverse effects? This research attempts to answer both premises using data for developed countries with high human capital levels: 27-member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development-OECD during 1980–2015. Access to energy and that it is non-polluting is raised as a goal of the Sustainable Development Goals. We combine linear and non-linear models: we specifically employ threshold regressions and second-generation cointegration techniques, FMOLS, and causality. Our results are disappointing for the first premise: economic development does not reduce energy consumption from fossil sources. However, human capital does decrease the consumption of non-renewable energy. In order to capture current trends in economies, we include the globalization index, the urbanization rate, and services. The results of the cointegration tests suggest the existence of a long-term relationship between the variables. Our results indicate that the human capital index and globalization are the last hope to promote the transition to a more sustainable energy matrix in developed countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Illinois passed the Energy Transition Act (i.e., the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act or CEJA) in 2021, which established clean energy mandates with an emphasis on social equity. We examine CEJA and related policies to understand the politics of Illinois' energy transition. While CEJA has been praised as an approach to a just transition, critics argue that it exacerbated Illinois' rural-urban dichotomy by distributing benefits to urban areas defined as ‘environmental justice communities’ and tangible costs, in the form of clean energy infrastructure, to rural communities. We demonstrate that, leading up to and in response, 1) local governments deployed measures to oppose renewable energy development and 2) the state, in turn, scaled authority for energy governance upward to inhibit opposition. By framing reduced participation as necessary for just climate action, Illinois undermined procedural forms of justice viewed as critical to a just transition and reinforced energy as a partisan political issue. This case illustrates how a narrow definition of justice can contribute to distributive conflict in the energy transition and identifies a need for more inclusive strategies to manage such conflict. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Waste management (WM) is a growing concern in Ghana, characterised by the widespread practice of open dumping and burning of waste. These unsustainable methods have raised significant environmental, health, and social concerns. This systematic review aims to comprehensively analyse the impacts of waste burning and open dumping in Ghana and propose a sustainable way forward for waste management. A systematic search of peer-reviewed articles, reports, and government documents was conducted using various academic databases and official websites. Studies published from 2000 to 2024 were included, focusing on the environmental, health, and socioeconomic impacts of waste burning and open dumping. Relevant sources were identified and critically assessed. The review revealed that open dumping and waste burning have substantial adverse impacts. The effects of waste burning and open dumping necessitate a holistic approach to address these challenges. This includes infrastructure development, implementation and enforcement of WM regulations, community engagement, technological solutions, promotion of recycling technologies, and public-private partnerships. By adopting these strategies, Ghana can mitigate the adverse effects of inappropriate waste disposal, protect public health, preserve the environment, and make significant progress toward a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future. This review contributes valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders committed to addressing the WM crisis in Ghana. It is a foundation for further research and action in this critical field. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - New Urban Management discusses how the logic of economic flows poses a challenge to local governments throughout the world. The book argues that the increased fluidity in economic life must have its reflection in local economic development policy. The analysis begins with the idea of space of flows, but this goes much further than available literature in urban political analysis. The starting point is the observation metropolitan governments' ability to maintain their economic vitality depends on their ability to attract flows of values through their assets. Such assets are, however, symbolic rather than physical, which implies the relevance of city branding. On that basis, this book builds a coherent picture of how flow analysis can be utilised in brand-oriented economic development policy. © Ari-Veikko Anttiroiko 2015.

AB  - Introduction: Regional environmental risk assessment is a practical approach to understanding and proactively addressing the cumulative effects of resource development in areas of regional importance. However, regional assessment is methodologically complex, and frameworks to identify and prioritize regional risk issues to guide effective management decisions are lacking. This research develops a risk and impacts-based cumulative effects assessment framework for scoping regional cumulative effects issues to guide present and future project and regional assessment. We operationalized the framework dubbed Risk Assessment Framework for Cumulative Effects (RAFCE) to assess the risks and impacts of proposed mining development in the Ring of Fire region of Northern Ontario, Canada. Methods: Methodologically, we built on existing studies to understand the key valued ecosystem components (VECs) impacted by mining; organized an expert Bowtie Risk Assessment Tool workshop and interviews to identify regional risks and define the VECs impacted by mining; and developed an impact prioritization model that helped quantify and prioritize impacts of mining. Results and Discussion: RAFCE enabled us to: a) identify drivers and impacts of cumulative effects and potential preventive and mitigation measures for effective cumulative effects management and b) describe, quantify, and rank the major impact and components of regional interest. Using RAFCE, we can identify and prioritize impacts that are cross-cutting, multisector‐driven, synergistic, and relevant to a region, visualize and understand the risk management process, identify policy and management issues to prevent risks or mitigate impacts, and ultimately inform resource allocation for effective regional cumulative effects assessment outcomes. RAFCE is suitable for engaging diverse stakeholders in planning for regional cumulative effects assessment.

AB  - The European bioeconomy offers a sustainable development model, but its successful implementation requires robust sustainability measures. Ensuring sustainability in bio-based value chains requires clearly defined operational characteristics and indicators that comprehensively address key sustainability and circularity aspects. These indicators must align with the European Union (EU) sustainability framework, policies and directives. This study analyzed existing certification schemes and labels (CSLs), benchmarking monitoring systems, and EU policies to identify key sustainability indicators. A grey literature review further supplemented this analysis. Additionally, an alignment study was conducted to assess how EU policies guide the transition towards a bioeconomy. The research identified the key indicators that CSLs should adopt to effectively support the EU sustainability policy framework. A total of 142 sustainability indicators were proposed across environmental (7 areas), social (5), and economic/circularity (4) pillars, along with 60 operational indicators in governance (4 principles), assurance (5), traceability (4), and standard setting (3). The analysis revealed gaps in CSLs and policies, particularly in the economic and circularity pillars, while environmental and social indicators showed better coverage but still need improvements in areas such as land use, air quality, water depletion and consumer feedback. These findings provide valuable insights for certification bodies, industry stakeholders, and policymakers, offering guidance towards the harmonization of CSLs and their alignment with the European bioeconomy policy framework. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - To promote environmentally sustainable water governance, this study emphasizes the necessity of aligning institutional structures with ecological scales. The research focused on the Urmia Lake Basin in Iran facing the serious problem of drying up. Beyond the political and economic determinants shaping the water governance system in the region, the study evaluated the effect of Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ULRP), an environmental movement, on the basin's water governance structure. Employing statistical mechanics methods to scrutinize Hamiltonian system costs related to administrative interactions for water supply-demand, the study assessed the structural fit of the water governance system to the basin across distinct stages: without- and with-including the ULRP. Results revealed diminished costs following ULRP involvement, notably in entities with higher water demands, head offices and the system overall, further improved by water-saving measures. These findings highlighted the efficacy of vertical (re)arrangements and structural reform through ULRP incorporation in enhancing system fit, stressing the significance of its water-saving policy. The methodology provides a fast and explicit scan of the system structure, demonstrating its ability to project the effect of institutional reforms on the system state. Serving as a constructive tool for policymakers, it facilitates rapid, efficient and informed decision-making in water governance. Furthermore, following the UN SDG 6, this framework supports integrated water resources management (IWRM) across sectors and regions, particularly targeting water-stressed contexts. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The purpose of this article is to analyze the slaughter zones from the perspective of socio-ecological systems (SSE) taking the Bahía de Quintero and Puchuncaví as a case study. For this, the work methodology consists of placing the issue in the context of environmental history and the Anthropocene, to then apply the theoretical elements that characterize the SSE, to the case study and the environmental conflict that has developed in the area. Although the case has been widely studied from different perspectives, holistic approaches such as the one proposed are required to better understand the problem. Through a combination of theoretical literature and literature on the case, it is argued that the SES of the area has evolved from an agrarian and fishing one, to a purely industrial and polluting one. In its development it has faced various shocks and crises. As a result, the system is characterized by a decrease in its resilience, being practically nil today, a high vulnerability and, above all, being unsustainable, therefore, it is concluded that it does not comply with supporting human well-being, one of the important elements in any socio-ecological system. © 2023 Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Debrecen.

AB  - Floods are destructive to society. Hence, to assess and manage flood risk is imperative. Flood risk assessments require several layers of analysis, from flood hazard to societal impact. This paper explores the maturity level and challenges related to three components of a comprehensive risk assessment: flood hazard, direct consequences, and indirect consequences. This is achieved by introducing and applying a maturity framework on flood hazard reports and flood risk management plans in Sweden, as required by the EU Floods Directive (FD). A longitudinal analysis is conducted over two FD cycles (2009–2015 and 2016–2021). Complementary interviews with county administrative boards and responsible authorities provide deeper insights into processes and practical challenges. The results reveal that the maturity level of flood hazard assessment is high, while direct and, in particular, indirect consequences assessments need increased attention and substantial improvements. Further, there is no significant increase in maturity between the FD cycles, indicating fundamental challenges towards achieving this. Critical steps forward include developing applicable methods for analysing both direct and indirect consequences of floods, improving data availability on functionality and interdependency of critical infrastructure and society at large, and creating incentives for a broader range of societal actors to participate in flood risk management. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - There is growing scholarly interest in notions of ecological gentrification – whereby environmental improvements drive up real estate prices, with the subsequent displacement of low-income residents – particularly in the global North. Drawing on an integrative review of extant literature on African urbanism, urban greenery encroachment and gentrification, this paper argues that the Western notion of ecological gentrification has little or no application in African cities, which are confronted with rapid encroachment on urban wetlands amidst burgeoning urbanization and its attendant increasing demand for property development. We conceptualize the African variant on ecological gentrification as “wetland gentrification”. It occurs when land scarcity and rising property values in African cities cause indiscriminate depletion of urban wetlands for property development, leading to the destruction of ecological resources and displacement of human populations. This paper discusses, among other topics, the implications of wetland gentrification for urban governance and vice versa. © 2024 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).

AB  - This paper contributes to understanding transition politics by conceptualizing (shifting) power relations between actors in sustainability transitions. The authors introduce a Multi-actor Perspective as a heuristic framework for specifying (shifting) power relations between different categories of actors at different levels of aggregation. First, an overview is provided of how power and empowerment have been treated in transition research, and remaining questions are identified on who exercises power and who is empowered by and with whom. It is argued that theoretical frameworks and empirical analyses in transition studies lack precision when it comes to distinguishing between different types and levels of actors. In response, a Multi-actor Perspective (MaP) is developed, which distinguishes among four sectors (state, market, community, third sector), and between actors at different levels of aggregation: (1) sectors, (2) organizational actors, and (3) individual actors. The paper moves on to specify how the MaP contributes to understanding transition politics specifically in conceptualizing shifting power relations. Throughout the paper, empirical illustrations are used regarding public debates on welfare state reform, civil society and ‘Big Society’, as well as more specific empirical examples of community energy initiatives. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study evaluates Kenya’s policy, legal, and institutional frameworks for managing the environmental, social, and Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) impacts of gold cyanidation, focusing on Siaya County. Despite the robust national policies and legal structures, such as the National Environment Policy, 2013 and the Mining Act, 2016, effectiveness is compromised by enforcement gaps and insufficient institutional resources. The Siaya County Integrated Development Plan (CIDP) (2018–2022) lacks specific provisions for gold cyanidation, indicating a misalignment between local and national policies. Institutional assessment reveals significant deficiencies, including under-resourced regulatory bodies like the Ministry of Mining and National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), which hamper effective oversight and enforcement. The study suggests that a multi-faceted approach involving strengthening public regulations, enhancing institutional capacities, and integrating private sector initiatives could offer a more comprehensive and sustainable management strategy for gold cyanidation impacts. By combining robust public frameworks with proactive private sector practices, Kenya can improve mining governance and address existing regulatory gaps. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Community resilience is widely used in managing natural resources and the environment as a means of system capacity to cope with stress. However, our findings show that resilience is not easily applied to common-pool resources (CPRs) such as peatlands, which are open access and full of importance. This is experienced by the community of purun craftsmen (Eleocharis dulcis) in Ogan Komering, Ilir Regency, South Sumatra, Indonesia. This paper was conducted to determine the community's social resilience in overcoming pressures originating from environmental, socio-economic, and political changes. We used a qualitative research method with a descriptive approach and obtained data through observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation. Our findings suggest that community resilience on peatlands is influenced by mechanisms to gain and maintain access to the resource. This mechanism is relatively limited, so it can be said that it is less robust, mainly if three threat scenarios co-occur, such as massive activity by companies, weak rules for managing, utilizing, and protecting resources, and extreme weather conditions. In conclusion, from these findings, we show that “access politics” and policy implications also play an essential role in increasing the resilience of socio-ecological systems in important peatland areas. © 2022 WITPress.

AB  - Polycentric governance (PG) describes governance systems characterized by multiple, interdependent centers of decision-making, offering an alternative to centralized governance models. PG is often assumed to be effective at helping policy actors address complex collective action problems, but burgeoning empirical literature on PG shows that it is not a panacea – PG is associated with both positive and negative governance outcomes. In this article, we ask: what do we know about why PG performs well in some cases but not in others? We start with a systematic review, synthesizing findings that provide empirical support for positive and negative features that are theorized to accompany PG. Our review reveals a critical gap in relation to our understanding of PG: the existing empirical literature largely fails to address change and evolution over time in PG systems, undermining our understanding of why PG works – or does not– across different contexts and over time. To fill this gap, we propose a “Context – Operations – Outcomes – Feedbacks” (COOF) framework that draws explicit attention to the interplay between context, operational arrangements, outcomes and identifies feedback pathways and adjustment mechanisms that drive dynamic change and evolution over time. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Cities are at the forefront of climate change action and planning for futures that are concomitantly more resilient and equitable, making local goals imperative for global sustainability. Under the multiple challenges of changing climatic, ecological and socio-economic conditions, cities need the means to meet these goals. We know cities are and will continue to be points of concentrated and diverse populations, socioeconomic vulnerability, amplified exposure, transformed ecosystems and are responsible for the bulk of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, much is also unknown and intrinsically uncertain about urban futures: there is a range of potential plausible futures which have differing implications for both potential mitigation and adaptation actions. To better assess these plausible futures, the “global change” research community developed a framework including scenarios that are applicable for global and regional policy, entitled the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and scenarios exploring future emissions that will drive climate change, entitled Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Importantly, this global scale framework does not include specific city-level perspectives or data at the spatial scales necessary to address questions of local relevance. While the SSPs address many of the key population and socioeconomic drivers of climate change, they do not address important concerns that are particularly relevant to cities, such as racial justice, ecosystem change or migration. Nevertheless, city-level impacts will evolve, in part, as a function of the global scale change characterized by the SSPs, and in part based on demographic and social processes already underway. As such, applying a modification of this framework to cities has the potential to help limit local climate impacts, and create a more resilient, equitable city. To address these needs and respond to city and regional stakeholders, we propose a framework for science-based narratives and quantitative projections for cities and metropolitan areas, such as Greater New York City. In this paper, we review a wide-range of existing approaches to generate estimates of future populations and identify their vulnerabilities to climate-change hazards, ranging from subnational population projections or the spatially-explicit allocation of populations linked to SSPs for the US and selected cities, city-specific population forecasting without climate considerations, and participatory approaches to future scenario development and fine-scale, within-city land use change models. By showcasing the strengths and limitations of various approaches and modeling efforts, their spatial and temporal scales, and thematic breadth, we propose a novel framework that leverages state-of-the art quantitative approaches and couples it with stakeholder engagement that can help cities plan equitably under uncertainty.

AB  - Cities as hotspots of human economic activity and infrastructures provide some of the best opportunities for decarbonizing sectors essential for limiting the global warming to 1.5, such as buildings and transport. For this reason, regulators and researchers have widely recognized the necessity to put cities, as an important object of assessment, and city authorities, as an important actor group, at the core of climate mitigation efforts. In their pursuit of a low-emission future, however, cities are confronted with a number of theoretical and practical questions regarding allocation and accounting of city-related greenhouse gas (GHG), target setting and subsequent planning for mitigation. A wide literature is currently focused on the first two. However, to achieve ambitious climate targets, research should urgently focus more on how to reap all available urban mitigation actions and encourage rapid and radical changes. Identifying and prioritising mitigation strategies and actions to achieve the targets, as well as putting them together into a coherent plan with a clear vision of the future, are critical steps in actionable and effective climate action planning. As a first contribution in this direction, this paper provides recommendations for research and practice to support a more integrated and conscious definition and prioritization of actions by municipal stakeholders, based on: (1) the specific context of each city type as a determinant of what actions may work, (2) the executive power of city authority to act as the main actor and (3) the multiple benefits and/or trade-offs accruing from each local climate action. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this study we use three different methodologies to document and compare temperature and precipitation projections for the city of Rio de Janeiro (RJ) over the 21st century. It aims to explore in what way the differences and similarities of those methodologies and their outcomes support the incorporation of climate risks in urban planning and improve effective urban climate change governance. We compared the projections for RJ from the Eta Regional Climate Model from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research nested in two Hadley Center Global Climate Models (GCMs) (Eta-HadCM3 method and Eta-HadGEM2-ES method) and 33 GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi-model dataset (Urban Climate Change Research Network - UCCRN method). The three methods showed increasing temperatures for RJ at the end of the century. Precipitation projections span a 13% decrease to a 12% increase when using the UCCRN method or are reduced between 0.4 and 0.5%, when using the Eta-HadGEM2-ES method. However, the middle range of the projections from UCCRN and Eta-HadGEM2-ES is similar. The three methods project an increase of warm days and nights and a decrease of cold days and nights. Nevertheless, although the directions of change are the same applying the three methods, the magnitude differs when considering warm and cold nights. Hence, city stakeholders are better informed when we apply different projection methods as it gives them the opportunity to consider the level of risk they are willing to bear in the future. We observed that defining climate change projections on the city scale based on clear communication and an interactive process between scientists and stakeholders can be used to inform citywide adaptation strategies and sector-specific uses, as well as promote urban climate risk governance.

AB  - Communities across the Western United States face the growing challenge of managing water resources in the face of rapid population growth and climate change. There are two contrasting approaches to understanding and managing residential water demand in this context. Many scientists and water managers see water use as a reflection of individual attitudes and decisions where people are assumed to have the agency to act independently of structural constraints. Conversely, other scientists and policymakers focus on the importance of the built environment and the broader social, economic, and policy contexts within which households make water decisions. Using multilevel models, we compared attitudinal, demographic, and structural drivers of indoor and outdoor residential water use for a sample of households in Northern Utah. We estimated multilevel mixed-effect Poisson models with robust standard errors using matched household survey data with metered residential water use records. Outdoor water use had a substantially greater amount of neighborhood-level variation than indoor water use. Structural factors generally eclipsed individual agency in our analysis. While indoor use was most strongly predicted by household size, tenure status, and length of residence, outdoor water use was most associated with the built environment (lot size and the presence of vegetable gardens and underground sprinklers), socioeconomic status (household income, rental status), and residents' sensitivity to lawn watering norms. Higher water prices were associated with lower water use, with lower-income households being more responsive to prices than higher-income households. Our findings have important implications for water managers and policymakers. © 2020

AB  - Assessing mismatches between ecosystem service (ES) supply and demand can provide relevant insights for enhancing human well-being in urban areas. This paper provides a novel methodological approach to assess regulating ES mismatches on the basis of environmental quality standards and policy goals. Environmental quality standards (EQS) indicate the relationship between environmental quality and human well-being. Thus, they can be used as a common minimum threshold value to determine whether the difference between ES supply and demand is problematic for human well-being. The methodological approach includes three main steps: (1) selection of EQS, (2) definition and quantification of ES supply and demand indicators, and (3) identification and assessment of ES mismatches on the basis of EQS considering certain additional criteria. While ES supply indicators estimate the flow of an ES actually used or delivered, ES demand indicators express the amount of regulation needed in relation to the standard. The approach is applied to a case study consisting of five European cities: Barcelona, Berlin, Stockholm, Rotterdam and Salzburg, considering three regulating ES which are relevant in urban areas: air purification, global climate regulation and urban temperature regulation. The results show that levels of ES supply and demand are highly heterogeneous across the five studied cities and across the EQS considered. The assessment shows that ES supply contributes very moderately in relation to the compliance with the EQS in most part of the identified mismatches. Therefore, this research suggests that regulating ES supplied by urban green infrastructure are expected to play only a minor or complementary role to other urban policies intended to abate air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions at the city scale. The approach has revealed to be appropriate for the regulating ES air purification and global climate regulation, for which well-established standards or targets are available at the city level. Yet, its applicability to the ES urban temperature regulation has proved more problematic due to scale and user dependent constraints. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drawing on an empirical study of environmental policies in Manchester (UK) and Saint-Etienne (France), this article attempts to provide a periodization of the evolution of the management of urban environmental issues. The periodization traces the shift in discourse from a focus on 'local environment' to 'sustainable urban development'. Three main sequences are identified corresponding to three different ways of tackling environmental issues covering a period from the late 1970s up to the present. The aim of this article is twofold. First, it will use environmental policies as a tool to understand the transformations of urban governance, and in particular the transformations of the actors involved in policy-making. Second, it will show how sustainable development policies are used by local elites to neutralize urban conflicts by excluding environmental grassroots movements from the management of environmental issues. Finally, the article will discuss how this marginalization should be considered as a sign of the emergence of a post-democratic era. © The Author(s) 2011.

AB  - In recent decades, academic and professional research has increased understanding of the importance of city and landscape planners engaging with social and environmental justice issues, including contemporary inequities inherent in the planning, distribution, use, and access of public green and open spaces. However, there is a gap between this research centering equity and the planning, development, and implementation rate demonstrated by public agencies. In this article, we examine examples of emerging practice in the public park and recreation sector to understand the strategies and approaches public agencies are taking to provide equitable park and recreation systems. Our research identifies and analyzes 17 examples of North American public park and open space management agencies using equity-based planning frameworks to prioritize park investment and resource distribution. Equity-focused resource analysis is distinct because while it assesses budget and project-based funding distributions, it further incorporates assessments of historical allocations to understand better areas of under-investment and the evolving needs of different communities. As economic inequities become more pronounced, local governments, and other public institutions providing services to populations, are important in helping communities navigate changes. Our findings support the ongoing advancement of equity-driven planning and implementation for public park and recreation agencies by providing practical information on existing approaches to redress the impact of unfair patterns of under-investment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Continues to fill gaps between the descriptive, conceptual, and transformative sustainability science Sustainability is increasingly important across functional sectors and scientific disciplines. Policy-makers, practitioners, and academics continue to wrestle with the complexity of risk, resilience, and sustainability, but because of the necessary transdisciplinary focus, it is difficult to find authoritative content in a single source. Sustainability Science: Managing Risk and Resilience for Sustainable Development, Second Edition, contributes to filling that gap and is completely revised with several new chapters. It asserts that all efforts for the sustainability of humankind are undermined by the four fundamental challenges of complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity, and dynamic change. While there are no silver bullets, this book contends that we need systems approaches, risk approaches, participatory approaches, and resilience approaches to address each of them and endeavours to provide such. With that in mind, this book describes the state of the world (Part I), proposes a way to approach the world (Part II), and suggests how to set out to change the world (Part III). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper focuses on the sustainability assessment of urban communities through multi-criterion rating systems. Recent interpretations of the concepts of sustainability, assessment and community are discussed before reviewing existing assessment systems. In particular, the systems BREEAM for Communities, LEED for Neighbourhood Development and CASBEE for Urban Development are presented and compared. Each one of these systems bases the assessment on the summation of rates for different criteria often similar to those considered in sustainability assessments of buildings. The comparison shows that existing systems often accept a weak sustainability where natural resources may be subsidized by other priorities. Missing assessment criteria are proposed mainly within the social and economic dimensions of sustainability. This paper also shows that the dynamicity of a community suggests considering the sustainability assessment systems as tools to monitor the evolution of communities. Finally, it shows that an increase in citizen engagement in the selection of assessment criteria is necessary to share priorities and customize sustainability goals for each community. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Urban-development controversies usually involve complicated struggles over knowledge. One way to analyse them is the framework of epistemic injustice – the feeling of one’s knowledge not being acted upon – often experienced by vulnerable groups. The present case shows that middle-class citizens are also affected as the controversy pits different understandings of ‘green’ against each other. Even activists in well-resourced positions protesting the development of a beautiful island, sense the weakness of official, modern types of evidence. They are, however, willing to host activist-artistic experiments that highlight various historical legacies of modern life, simultaneously challenging conventional ways of knowing and definitions of what is environmental. The paper interprets this form of activism as making the island itself appear as a crystallisation of harmful processes, diffused in time and space and involving diverse types of actors. Difficult to capture with modern ways of knowing, these processes are nevertheless embedded in the natural and cultural heritage accumulated over time in urban landscapes. © 2023 The White Horse Press.

AB  - Smart cities are evolving and ever changing, i.e., morphing into new faces. This is being fueled by the rapid computerization and urbanization of the world, driven by the evolvement of ICT visions of various forms of pervasive computing into deployable and achievable computing paradigms, as well as by the perceived role of advanced ICT in overcoming the challenge of urbanization. Indeed, visions of noteworthy advances in computing and ICT bring with them wide-ranging common visions on how cities as social fabrics will evolve in the future along with the immense opportunities and potential threats such future will bring. However, there are several critical issues that remain largely ignored concerning smarter cities. In particular, smarter (and smart) cities involve several problems—when it comes to their development and implementation as to their concrete contribution to and explicit incorporation of the fundamental goal of environmentally sustainable development. They moreover pose many risks to environmental sustainability due to the ubiquity of computing and the massive use of ICT throughout all urban domains. Also, relatively little or no attention has been given to smarter cities as future visions of smart cities in terms of the potential of ICT of various forms of pervasive computing to respond to the challenge of environmental sustainability. In addition, it is important not to conceive of smarter cities as “isolated islands”, like some urban scholars might presume. Instead, the interplay between such cities and other scales, as well as the links to political and regulatory processes on a macro level have to be recognized. The purpose of this chapter is manifold. First, it reviews the key deficiencies, misunderstandings, fallacies, and challenges associated with smart and smarter cities with respect to environmental sustainability. Second, it identifies the significant risks that smarter cities pose to environmental sustainability, which are expected to escalate during the transition of smart cities to smarter cities. Third, it substantiates the potential that smarter cities hold in accelerating and advancing environmental sustainability on the basis of ICT of various forms of pervasive computing. The underlying assumption is that smarter cities are still at the early stage of their development and thus could, if planned strategically, do a lot more in this regard, including the mitigation of environmental risks posed by ICT itself, if linked to the goal of environmentally sustainable development. Fourth, this chapter endeavors to reflect on what it means for smart cities to move behind their foundational visions as they transition to smarter cities and embrace environmental sustainability as an important trend increasingly gaining prominence in urban development as a result of the unprecedented urbanization of the world. Fifth, this chapter probes both the ways in which the transition of smart cities to smarter cities (with environmental sustainability in mind) can be managed or governed at the macro level as well as the role of politics and policy in the creation and evolution of smarter cities. This entails drawing on different theoretical perspectives from socio-technical studies, innovation studies, and discursive studies, most notably transition governance; technological and national innovation systems; and the link between political practice and the emergence, insertion, and functioning of new discourses. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Resilience is defined here considering the behaviour of an urban drainage risk management (UDRM) system in terms of its response and recovery under different rainfall events focusing on institutional and social aspects. A set of indicators is defined to operationalise definition for UDRM systems. To quantify the indicators, a hierarchical fuzzy system is developed to consider uncertainties in the UDRM system’s social and institutional parameters and also to prevent the curse of dimensionality. The proposed scheme is tested on a real case study in Tehran in order to evaluate the effectiveness of some urban drainage plans to improve the current urban drainage system in terms of resilience. The results show that the presented indicators may be used as decision making criteria to help urban authorities select urban drainage options based on the behaviour of the UDRM system under different rainfall events. © 2016, Thomas Telford Services Ltd.

AB  - Marginalization of communities is a global, multidimensional challenge with social, ecological, and economic implications for sustainable futures. Energy systems may be an active component in the creation and perpetuation of marginalization, as well as in its disruption. Therefore, while one of the key goals of undertaking deliberate transitions of energy systems lies in rapidly cutting emissions for planetary well-being, an equally critical and inseparable goal is to transform the human well-being landscape - that is, to accelerate human development in historically marginalized communities. This chapter explores facets of human development including equitable growth, agency, and identity, socioeconomic opportunity and justice, safeguards for vulnerabilities to climate change and exclusion, and so on, in marginalized communities undergoing localized energy transitions. Employing the social value of energy framework for a systemic analysis of case studies from Bolivia, Nepal, and Bangladesh, illustrations of positive shifts, missed opportunities, and future pathways of the intertwined energy and human development transitions are discussed. Three critical aspects emerge for the pursuit of equitable, just, and sustainable energy transitions for human development in marginalized communities: identifying social purpose of designing energy systems, incorporating ethics and sociocultural values in energy decisions, and inclusion of due process and legitimate actors in energy governance. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Kathleen M.

AB  - Politicians, consultants, and researchers often look at successful transport and urban transformation projects in cities in developing countries and assume that these may be an appropriate solution for similar cities. In reality, customizing such projects for a city-specific context is a difficult challenge that does not always end well, for example, because of poor technical and financial capacity of transport institutions, scarce information on travel demand behavior during the planning stage, private companies operating routes with a certain degree of informality, and poor political commitment. The authors reviewed the experience of implementing bus rapiti transit systems in five cities in Colombia that followed the steps of the successful Transmilenio in Bogotá. Most projects had cost overruns and lower demand and therefore performed worse than expected in ex-post assessments. Competition from traditional and private transport and institutional capacity at the local level were key problems to be addressed. The authors also reviewed the experience or cable cars, the new à la mode project, which was promoted in a number of developing cities such as Cali and Soacha after the success of the Metrocable in Medellín. Cable cars could contribute to equity in cities, but these contributions would be extremely limited if the project did not inject the urban environment with complementary investments. Transferring successful transportation projects to new areas or to other cities is an important, difficult challenge. Key success factors must be considered to implement transport solutions successfully in different contexts.

AB  - In the past decade, the importance of the smart city applications has gained popularity by the city governments to use their resources in an efficient and effective way, present better services and quality of life for their residents, make their cities more competitive, provide better disaster management. As the world has experienced crisis such as energy and grain in the recent past due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the war between Russia and Ukraine, the management of the resources has become more important for the countries and local governments, as well. In this study national government plans of Turkiye, such as Eleventh Development Plan and 2020–2023 National Strategy and Action Plan for Smart Cities, have been addressed as reference documents and the actions of some city governments, including the most populous city, Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, have been examined with the purpose of determining the level of smart city willingness. This study peruses the degree of enthusiasm of the local governments to become smart and maintain sustainable city services considering the main smart city characteristics. Based on the information gathered concerning the selected cities, it has been observed that the cities having populations quite lower than the great metropolitans such as Istanbul and Ankara are more enthusiastic and successful to provide services for their citizens that can be associated with the smart city concept. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The paradigm for providing affordable electricity for the world's poor-power for development-has begun to change. Historically, centralized governments built large consolidated power plants and distribution and transmission lines with the ultimate goal of providing electricity to all of their citizens. It has become increasingly common in recent decades, however, for donors, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), firms, and communities to collaborate with governments to develop small-scale localized energy systems known as distributed generation (DG) either as complements or alternatives to centralized operations. DG programs have been implemented around the world but with a mixed record of success. Based on an analysis of the existing case study literature, we examine DG program goals and outcomes, identifying major factors that affect these outcomes, including appropriately chosen technology, adequate financing and payment arrangements, ongoing end users' involvement, and supportive national policies. We highlight the importance of institutions for collaborative governance in the pursuit of these factors. © Copyright ©2012 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to combine and integrate environmental, economic and social impact assessment procedures in order to support decision-making in the context of flood control policy in the Netherlands. The hydraulic, hydrological, ecological, economic and social effects of alternative flood control policies, such as land use change and floodplain restoration, are evaluated using a combination of advanced quantitative modelling techniques and qualitative expert judgement. The results from the ecological, economic and social impact assessment are evaluated in an integrated way through cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and multi-criteria analysis (MCA). As expected, these methods produce different outcomes. Although traditional flood control policy-building higher and stronger dikes-is a cost-effective option, investment in alternative flood control policy-land use changes and floodplain restoration-can be justified on the basis of both CBA and MCA when including the additional ecological and socio-economic benefits in the long run. The outcome of the MCA appears to be especially sensitive to the inclusion of the qualitative scores for the expected social impacts of land use change and floodplain restoration. An important research question remains how to assess, integrate and trade-off (1) significantly different types of impacts in a methodologically sound way in both cost-benefit and multi-criteria analysis, and (2) significantly different types and quality of available knowledge and information about these impacts. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The paper briefly overviews different types of diversity; not only ecological ones but also its various socio, economical as well as local, regional and global technological appearances, like the importance of retaining irreplaceable cultural diversity and the diverse ways of thinking and behaviour. The first part of the study analyses these different types of diversity which are preserved. The discussion of the mutual connections of the bio-cultural diversity is the content of the next section. Sustainable development is in great need of adequate competencies and expertise, both in the planning and implementation phase of promoting programmes and projects, including the long-term and complicated effects of them. The fundamental condition of sustainability - and therefore any plan which intends to produce a sustainable socio, economical, moreover ecological system (SES), is that it should express the need for resilient improvement of institutions, and, in particular, the suitable institutionalisation of the decision making process. The research and assessment methodology of this study has been the gathering of a broad spectrum of social, economical, technological and ecological publications on this topic, evaluation of the scientific literature and also the combination of their results. The end of the paper consists of conclusions and furthermore, suggestions for scientists, experts and politicians on how to apply a holistic, multidisciplinary approach and methodology both in proposal and decision making processes. © 2013 WIT Press.

AB  - An ideal form of smart city planning would focus on the availability of urban amenities that can meet the basic needs of a resident's material life, civil connections, and humanistic spirit. Previous studies have concentrated on analyzing the spatial distribution of urban services, with less attention on their contribution as local urban amenities. In this study, we propose a spatial dynamic modeling approach based on urban amenities using social media data from Google Place API to provide locational information on potential resident interactions. We use a representative region in Europe (Stockholm County, SE) to simulate and project urban development in the region until 2050. Our circular conceptual framework of spatial information and feedback supports decision-makers in testing possible urban planning scenarios that align with the vision of a smart city. Simulation results reveal the interplay between human-land interactions on a specific spatial-temporal scale, and we analyze scenario outcomes in relation to commercial and residential land uses. Overall, our study provides a new perspective on human-social behavior-driven urban development, through a smart, spatial dynamic model as a planning support system that can enhance realism, and ultimately help realize planned development objectives in the region. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Urban eco-environmental management is a key focus in the modernization of national governance systems and governance capacity. Advanced information technology should be used to identify ecological problems in urban areas accurately while enhancing the environmental management capacity to promote the sustainable development of cities. This study centers on statistical data from PM2.5 air monitoring stations in Shenzhen, China, and supplemental data, such as population distribution data from China Unicom's mobile phone signaling. Data cleaning and fusion are used to construct a spatial dataset of an eco-environmental problem: PM2.5 concentrations. The geostatistical analysis tool ArcGIS is used to identify the most suitable interpolation method for reflecting this eco-environmental problem based on multiple parameter adjustments and repeated testing. A hotspot distribution map of PM2.5 concentrations is generated, and correlation analysis is conducted on the population density and distribution patterns in these hotspot areas. This enables the quantitative analysis and exploration of the spatial characteristics and coupling relationships of PM2.5 concentrations. The results show a positive correlation between the PM2.5 concentration distribution and the points of interest, road network density, number of dead-end roads, and average building height in Shenzhen. No correlation is found between population and building densities and the PM2.5 concentration distribution, possibly due to the city's effective environmental management and pollution control measures. These findings help advance the development of precise, scientific, legally compliant pollution control strategies and decision-making processes. Furthermore, they provide technical support for urban eco-environmental planning, management, and sustainable development. © 2025 Shandong Normal University

AB  - Digital twin technologies play a very important role in the provision of smart cities. However, it is not clear which innovative strategies should be implemented first on how to optimize digital twin technologies for sustainable smart cities. The main performance indicators should be identified to use the limited resources more efficiently and to generate more effective investment strategies. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to generate innovative approaches to green digital twin technologies of sustainable smart cities. To achieve this issue, first, important criteria of digital twin technologies for assessing sustainable smart cities are weighted via spherical fuzzy simple weight calculation (SIWEC). The second part includes ranking innovative alternatives for green digital twin technologies by considering spherical fuzzy simple additive weighting (SAW). The main contribution of this manuscript is to identify the most effective investment strategies for the improvements of digital twin technologies to reach smart cities by establishing a novel model. The preference of the SIWEC method in the criteria weighting process provides some advantages to the model. The most important feature of this method is that the direct importance of the criterion is taken into consideration in the questions asked to the experts. In this way, it is possible for the experts to give more sensitive answers. The findings indicate that smart grid integration (weight: 0.231) is determined as the most important criterion in the development of digital twin technologies for the provision of smart cities. Circular economy (weight: 0.230) is another variable that plays an important role in the provision of smart cities. On the other hand, decentralized energy system with microgrids is found as the most important alternative for this situation. Some critical actions should be taken to improve the smart grid effectiveness. In this scope, providing renewable energy incentives has a strong influence on the improvements of these projects. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - In order to make the transition from a linear to a circular economy, unprecedented measures are required from all social actors. Communication plays a fundamental role in this transition. The use of social marketing as an alternative to traditional communication models can promote the paradigm shift in order to increase communicative effectiveness. Understanding the perception of circular economy drivers is crucial for communication efforts aimed at persuading citizens to change their habits. To this end, this study analyzes drivers' perceptions of communication processes aimed at environmental awareness and sensitization. Using grounded theory, a qualitative methodology, 44 interviews were conducted with four groups that are considered promoters of the circular economy: Public administration and private enterprises representatives, university professors and scientific personnel. The actors' discourse was analyzed and the results show how they perceive their involvement in the transition process, the level of public awareness and the awareness-raising measures. The conclusion is: a) communication plays a fundamental role in fostering cooperation between all actors involved in the transition to a circular economy; b) communication strategies targeting society should be segmented by population groups, taking into account aspects such as area, age and level of awareness. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coastal zones are rapidly changing all around the world due to strong human pressures such as urban sprawl, agriculture intensification, infrastructure expansion and industrial growth. In addition, climate change might become an important factor in the years to come, and its associated effects might affect coastal areas. To cope with this situation the need to adopt an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) approach has been internationally recognised during the last decades. Nonetheless to be able to plan and manage coastal areas in the long-term while facing all the challenges that lie ahead, it is necessary to develop new tools that not only put into practice the ICZM principles but also incorporate and deal with the uncertainties that surround the future. In this paper, we present Participative Future Scenarios (PFS) as a tool to support decision-making in coastal areas under the ICZM principles. PFS allow exploring how coastal areas could develop in the future, using an integrative approach that combines quantitative and qualitative methods, taking into consideration coastal hazards and climate change, as well as human interaction, as the process is based on participatory techniques involving local stakeholders. The process carried out to implement PFS at the local scale has been pilot-tested in the Andalusian coastal municipality of Ayamonte, South Western Spain. Four well-differentiated scenarios showing alternative and plausible futures for the study site for the year 2050 were obtained. The result of this pioneer exercise points out that PFS are a powerful and ground-breaking tool for ICZM with a double potential: i) The generation of PFS is a valuable exercise per se as it provides an opportunity to promote participation, understand public's different opinions, facilitate communication between stakeholders and increase public awareness about coastal future problems (e.g. coastal hazards). ii) PFS can be-and should be-used as part of the decision making process for coastal planning, allowing policies to be designed in a more robust manner, accounting for critical uncertainties-as diverse as economic fluctuations or climate change- and helping to select the path to the most desirable future. Additionally, the PFS process proposed in this paper is a transferable technique that can be easily replicated in other coastal areas. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.

AB  - Sustainability standards have been criticized as being complex and overlapping, with unclear metrics and messy timelines—all of which have led to sustainability shortfalls. As part of the special issue on addressing sustainability metric shortcomings, we develop a hybridizing protocol for sustainability standards that elicits community stakeholder ideological predispositions, preferences, ratings, and heuristics and injects them into a prioritized, vetted metric in order to reduce immediate and longer-range life cycle impacts of corporate operations in the local ecosystem. We demonstrate our method using a quasi-field experiment, conducted by expert intermediary facilitators, in which community members co-design oil sands wetland reclamation and their choices are integrated into life cycle assessments (LCAs) of wetland designs and remediation products. Hybridizing LCA with local co-design not only generates an effective wetland-material choice, but reduces life cycle impacts and increases the likelihood of community acceptance. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Within the smart city debate, this paper aims to reflect on whether and how medium-sized Italian cities are organizing their smart transition technically as well as administratively. The smart city concept was developed in the 1990s when major European cities began a smart transition through widespread urban regeneration projects and the introduction of advanced technologies applied not only to the physical city but also to governance, policymaking, and communication, involving multiple sectors of city administrations. In the last decade, medium-sized cities have also started this transition process, although with lower emphasis than metropolitan cities. In most medium-sized Italian cities, this transition, in accordance with national and regional guidelines, has sometimes led to competencies reorganization within local governments. Within this framework, the paper examines the tools with which medium-sized Italian cities’ administrations address the smart transformation in their territories, comparing a sample of 10 cities in Emilia-Romagna and considering policymaking, governance structure, past and current projects, and communication transparency. The expected result is therefore a systematic review of experiences to reconstruct a complex picture of the political and administrative choices that have led to the implementation or setting in motion of smart transformation processes to draw some useful lessons. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - A growing scholarship on multistakeholder learning dialogues suggests the importance of closely managing learning processes to help stakeholders anticipate which policies are likely to be effective. Much less work has focused on how to manage effective transnational multistakeholder learning dialogues, many of which aim to help address critical global environmental and social problems such as climate change or biodiversity loss. They face three central challenges. First, they rarely shape policies and behaviors directly, but work to ‘nudge’ or ‘tip the scales’ in domestic settings. Second, they run the risk of generating ‘compromise’ approaches incapable of ameliorating the original problem definition for which the dialogue was created. Third, they run the risk of being overly influenced, or captured, by powerful interests whose rationale for participating is to shift problem definitions or narrow instrument choices to those innocuous to their organizational or individual interests. Drawing on policy learning scholarship, we identify a six-stage learning process for anticipating effectiveness designed to minimize these risks while simultaneously fostering innovative approaches for meaningful and longlasting problem solving: Problem definition assessments; Problem framing; Developing coalition membership; Causal framework development; Scoping exercises; Knowledge institutionalization. We also identify six management techniques within each process for engaging transnational dialogues around problem solving. We show that doing so almost always requires anticipating multiple-step causal pathways through which influence of transnational and/or international actors and institutions might occur. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The social, environmental, and technological transformations that cities are experiencing have limi-ted children's opportunities to interact with nature and care for the environment. This study analyzed the relationship between pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors with children's level of contact with nature and their visits to urban green spaces designed for play. A mixed methodology was used that involved individual interviews, didactic activities and drawings on specific topics by children from elementary schools. The results of the study highlighted a significant relationship between pro-environmental attitudes and children's visits to parks. However, limitations were identified in the ex-ploration of pro-environment behaviors. The authors concluded that parks can be considered out-door play spaces and children have the potential to develop pro-environmental attitudes. © 2024 Revista Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales.

AB  - This paper uses an expert-based methodology to survey the barriers and strategies related to the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS). The ambition of the paper is to offer a bird's eye overview of the difficulties encountered by NBS deployment and ways to overcome them. With a wide participation of 80 experts from COST Action Circular City, we identify barriers specific to 35 pre-defined NBS of the following four categories: Vertical Greening Systems and Green Roofs; Food and Biomass Production; Rainwater Management; and Remediation, Treatment, and Recovery. The research sheds light on how a major interdisciplinary – yet predominantly technically-oriented - community of scientists and practitioners views this important topic. Overall, the most relevant barriers are related to technological complexity, lack of skilled staff and training programs and the lack of awareness that NBS is an option. Our results highlight concerns related to post implementation issues, especially operation and maintenance, which subsequently affect social acceptance. The paper identifies a “chain” effect across barriers, meaning that one barrier can affect the existence or the relevance of other barriers. In terms of strategies, most of them target governance, information, and education aspects, despite the predominantly technical expertise of the participants. The study innovates with respect to state-of-the-art research by showing a fine-grained connection between barriers, strategies and individual NBS and categories, a level of detail which is not encountered in any other study to date. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Our world seems entangled in systems increasingly dominated by power, greed, ignorance, self-deception and denial, with spiralling inequity and injustice. Against a backdrop of climate change, failing ecosystems, poverty, crushing debt and corporate exploitation, the future of our world looks dire and the solutions almost too monumental to consider. Yet all is not lost. Robert Chambers, one of the 'glass is half full' optimists of international development, suggests that the problems can be solved and everyone has the power at a personal level to take action, develop solutions and remake our world as it can and should be. Chambers peels apart and analyses aspects of development that have been neglected or misunderstood. In each chapter, he presents an earlier writing which he then reviews and reflects upon in a contemporary light before harvesting a wealth of powerful conclusions and practical implications for the future. The book draws on experiences from Africa, Asia and elsewhere, covering topics and concepts as wide and varied as irreversibility, continuity and commitment; administrative capacity as a scarce resource; procedures and principles; participation in the past, present and future; scaling up; behaviour and attitudes; responsible wellbeing; and concepts for development in the 21st century. © Institute of Development Studies, 2005.

AB  - The need for a carbon-free ecosystem is a quest that cannot be answered without the engagement, participation, commitment, and deployment of sophisticated countermeasure strategies by national and international governing bodies and institutions. Therefore, the current study explores the context of ASEAN countries because of their significance in the global economy, whereas the role of structural transformation, urbanization, and renewable energy consumption was explored in determining the possible effects of sustainable energy technologies innovations from 1995 to 2020. Using Methods of Moments Quantile Regression, the current study's findings show that structural transformation, urbanization, and renewable energy consumption significantly derive sustainable energy technology innovations. However, the marginal contribution towards innovation-driven technologies is substantially varied at lower and higher quantiles. Similar findings are echoed in alternative estimators and offer substantial policy implications for driving green innovation. © 2023

AB  - While promoting the rapid development of social economy, new urbanization has brought great pressure to the ecological environment. It is of great significance to explore the interaction mechanism between ecological environment and new urbanization for the sustainable development of metropolitan area. The metropolitan area of Nanchang in China was taken as the research area, and based on remote sensing, meteorological and social statistics data, and considering the functions, structures and effects of urban, agricultural and ecological spaces as well as the realistic demands of new urbanization construction, this research constructed “natural foundation-structure-coerce-benefit” (NSCB) and “land use-economic-population-infrastructure-public service” (LEPIP) comprehensive assessment models to quantitatively analyze the spatial and temporal heterogeneity, spatial correlation and interaction strength of ecological quality and new urbanization level in the study area from mesoscopic and microscopic perspectives by using spatial analysis software such as ENVI, ArcGIS, Fragstats, Geoda and Geodetector. The results showed that the ecological environment quality and urbanization level of the land space in the study area were improved from 2005 to 2018, and the overall gap within the region was gradually reduced. The spatial relationship between land use efficiency and ecological quality was “synergistic-trade-off-synergistic”. The economic development level and ecological quality showed a gradually enhanced synergistic relationship, and the population urbanization, infrastructure construction and ecological quality showed an “N” type synergistic relationship. The results of interaction intensity showed that the combined effects of population urbanization, public service guarantee, land use efficiency and economic development had a great impact on the spatial heterogeneity of territorial ecological quality in the study area. Finally, we suggest that the urbanization construction in the study area should strengthen the industrial agglomeration effect, improve the efficiency of land output, build a good urban ecological network, and promote the coordinated and healthy development of natural resources and urban construction. The results of this study can provide scientific basis for the precise formulation of spatial planning, ecological restoration and spatial collaborative development strategies in the study area, and provide reference experience for the coordinated development of natural environment and social economy in other metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations. © 2023

AB  - The integration of a decentralized home energy management system (HEMS) marks a pivotal advancement in the pursuit of enhanced energy efficiency and sustainability within modern households. While numerous studies focus on developing efficient and innovative programs from technical perspectives, the willingness of individuals to adopt these systems is equally crucial for achieving widespread adoption and ultimately creating a more energy-efficient society. Based on a large-scale online survey with 1,196 participants in California in 2021, we investigated the intentions related to the adoption of decentralized HEMS, particularly considering demand flexibility encompassing both air-conditioning (AC) and electric vehicles (EV) control, specifically focusing on socio-demographic disparities. Our analysis found greater openness for allowing HEMS to control AC usage compared to scheduling EV charging, possibly due to immediate comfort needs or trust in AC predictability. Low-income households showed less flexibility in adjusting both AC and EVs, while high-income households were less likely to decrease EV charging. Furthermore, homeowners exhibited greater flexibility compared to renters. Disparities between different racial backgrounds in EV charging time-shifting were more pronounced than in AC aspects. Our findings indicated that vulnerable populations may lack the flexibility and resources necessary to shift their energy consumption patterns effectively, potentially amplifying energy-related disparities and exacerbating their energy burden. Policy recommendations highlight the need for multifaceted approaches in addressing demand flexibility and energy management, especially with emerging technologies like EVs, to ensure equitable strategies for promoting sustainable energy practices across diverse communities. © 2024

AB  - The prioritization of public transit as an essential means of promoting sustainable urban development has a significant role in improving the quality of public transportation services, reducing traffic congestion, and enhancing air quality. To improve the implementation of public transit prioritization policies, this study conducted a comprehensive review of relevant literature on public transit prioritization from two major citation databases (Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) from 2003 to 2021. Utilizing the visualization analysis software CiteSpace, this study analyzed knowledge visualization from five aspects: research sources, research institutions, knowledge foundation, knowledge frontier, and research hotspots, and summarized the research history and implementation effectiveness of public transit prioritization policies. The study concludes that existing research has some deficiencies in terms of urban diversity, comprehensive evaluation system, holistic perspective, interdisciplinary collaboration, and consideration of economic and environmental impacts. Future research should focus on development directions such as intelligence, sustainability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and integration of multi-modal transportation. The findings of this study can provide valuable references for the implementation of public transportation prioritization policies and future research. © 2023 Periodical Offices of Changâ€™an University

AB  - Under the influence of factors such as extreme weather and accelerated urbanization, China has witnessed a sharp escalation in conflicts between various land-use functions, leading to a significant rise in tensions between people and land. The coordination of production, living, and ecological functions is particularly important for strengthening ecological civilization and achieving regional high-quality development. The concept of “Production–Living–Ecological” (PLE) Spaces, proposed as part of China’s ecological civilization initiative, refers to a spatial framework that integrates production spaces (land for agriculture, industry, and commerce), living spaces (land for housing, consumption, and public services), and ecological spaces (land supporting ecosystem regulation and biodiversity). Based on this perspective, this paper investigates the current situation and potential of land-use function conflicts in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area in 2020. Utilizing the multi-criteria evaluation analysis method, the study develops a land-use function-evaluation model. Furthermore, the paper establishes a diagnostic model for the intensity of land-use function conflicts based on the different permutations and combinations of land unit function intensities. The land-use function conflicts are categorized into ten types and four stages. The main findings are as follows: (1) In 2020, the overall production, living, and ecological functions of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao Greater Bay Area were at high, medium-high, and low levels, respectively. The land in the stable and controllable stage, the largely controllable stage, the largely out-of-control stage, and the severely out-of-control stage accounted for 39.22%, 28.73%, 25.41%, and 6.64%. The focal points of the intensity of land-use function conflicts were mainly located in Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen, and Dongguan. (2) The study area was exposed to varying degrees of risk from land-use function conflicts, and the area proportion of low conflict potential area, with the proportions of low, general, higher, and high-conflict-potential areas being 47.88%, 23.43%, 22.14%, and 6.54%, respectively. (3) The primary hotspots of conflict potential were concentrated in Dongguan City and the administrative border areas of “Foshan–Zhaoqing”, “Foshan–Jiangmen”, and “Guangzhou–Zhongshan”. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: The world is characterized by the co-existence of excessive opulence and considerable destitution. Some groups have had success in accessing and taking advantage of the opportunities offered by modern economic growth; others have been left behind. It is a well-known fact that societies throughout time have always had this ‘two-tier’ structure of ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots.’ So, the question that arises is this: Is it possible to achieve equality among all groups and among all individuals? The answer depends in large part on the definition of ‘equality’ and the subsequent question, ‘equality of what?’ (Sen 1980). The one simple truism we accept and value is the heterogeneity of human beings. We all come into this world with different natural attributes as well as social and economic endowments – what we might call intrinsic initial conditions. It is the very differences among individuals that provide the incentives to change, adapt and innovate. However, we also need to ask ourselves whether we are willing to accept a world where individuals starve, die from the lack of drinking water, succumb to diseases which could have been treated with little cost, not have homes to live in or the ability for children to go to school and learn. Can we accept these as just manifestations of our intrinsic conditions or can some form of equality be established which at the same time does not destroy our unique values and attributes that make us all so different? © Cambridge University Press 2008 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.

AB  - Cities, especially in the poor countries, are competing with one another to generate higher growth. Such competition makes everything including the environment subservient to ‘technology’. As a consequence, they are faced with extreme weather events and are therefore important in the context of responding to climate change. They are increasingly being recognised as having unique climate risks and specific vulnerabilities due to higher concentration of people and activities. Adaptation seems to be indispensable though mitigation still will help avoiding future impacts. Urban authorities in poor countries encounter specific realities, such as occupancy in low-lying, often flood-prone, coastal locations that lack adequate protection in addition to possible vector-borne infections. In this backdrop, this paper analyzes specific factors likely to shape climate change responses of urban authorities in poorer countries who have to find ways to tackle impacts of climate change in tune to their specific institutional and social contexts and compulsions. © 2019

AB  - As the hubs of economic activity, cities drive the vast majority of the world's energy use and are major contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. Because they are home to major infrastructure and highly concentrated populations, cities are also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms. At the same time, better urban planning and policies can reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions and improve the resilience of urban infrastructure to climate change, thus shaping future trends. This book shows how city and metropolitan regional governments working in tandem with national governments can change the way we think about responding to climate change. The chapters analyse: trends in urbanisation, economic growth, energy use and climate change; the economic benefits of climate action; the role of urban policies in reducing energy demand, improving resilience to climate change and complementing global climate policies; frameworks for multilevel governance of climate change including engagement with relevant stakeholders; and the contribution of cities to "green growth", including the "greening" of fiscal policies, innovation and jobs. The book also explores policy tools and best practices from both OECD and some non-member countries. Cities and Climate Change reveals the importance of addressing climate change across all levels of government. Local involvement through "climate-conscious" urban planning and management can help achieve national climate goals and minimise tradeoffs between environmental and economic priorities at local levels. The book will be relevant to policy makers, researchers, and others with an interest in learning more about urbanisation and climate change policy. © OECD 2010.

AB  - Purpose - To combine insights from urban and environmental sociology to examine local drivers of carbon emissions in the United States, with particular focus on demographic, economic, and consumptive dynamics. Design/methodology/approach - Apply spatial regression analysis to a novel county-level data set to test hypotheses about how different conditions and activities relate independently and positively to total carbon emissions at the local level. Findings - Results provide strong support for theoretically derived hypotheses, even after controlling for other factors, including spatial autocorrelation. The implication is that within a social system that treats land as a commodity, efforts to increase the exchange value of this commodity tend to drive up local carbon emissions, thereby contributing to global climate change. Originality/value - Complements previous sociological work on greenhouse gas emissions at the national level. Shows how local processes in general and urbanization in particular contribute to global climate change at and from the local areas where they occur.

AB  - The paper is rooted in the results of the Resilience Practices Observatory (RPO) project, which engaged more than one hundred community-led practices to improve local resilience capacities and about fifty applied research and institutional-led initiatives. The article in retracing the complex and articulated RPO research-action project aims to stimulate the disciplinary debate on the contribution and role of resilience practices in a renewed landscape planning framework process. In particular, the paper focuses on the resilience practices acting on ecological landscape enhancement, assuming nature-based solutions as an umbrella concept under numerous approaches, models, and theoretical frameworks supporting the integration of ecological values in the territorial and urban transformation towards their conservation and improvement. The selected cases are placed in the Milano metropolitan area, aiming to safeguard, improve, and valorize urban and periurban landscapes. The cases are used to explore three emerging phenomena: (1) the alliances and the role of community in orienting landscape planning; (2) the role of practices in solution co-design and planning implementation; (3) the role of community in micro-intervention for urban biodiversity and landscape functionality. The final section emphasizes the potential role of community-led initiatives in implementing the NBS European policy and landscape planning guidelines. In the meantime, final remarks underline perspectives in overcoming the existing criticalities towards renovated and adaptive governance process, enabling a more collaborative arena supporting the engagement of differentiated actors along the whole process, from decision making to the implementation and management of landscape planning. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - In recent years, the concept of smart cities has become increasingly important in the pursuit of sustainable development goals. In general, common urban challenges have been addressed through smart-city services, and new perspectives for more sustainable cities have emerged. To realize the full potential of such smart urban environments, geospatial approaches have been used as a focal point, offering a plethora of applications that contribute to a better understanding of urban challenges and innovation potentials. Nevertheless, although significant progress has been made, different problems may arise when the available technologies and resources are not understood or even when their potentialities are not properly capitalized. This article reviews the state of the art in the field, highlighting success cases and remaining challenges in exploiting geospatial data-driven strategies, particularly when leveraging geographic information systems, satellites, and distributed sensors to produce and process geospatial data and datasets in urban scenarios. Moreover, a more organized perspective of the area is provided in this article, as well as future development trends, supporting new research efforts in this area when empowering smart cities for a more sustainable future. © 2024 by the authors.

We reviewed 50 publicly available Requests for Proposals (RFPs) issued between 2016 and 2019 and evaluated the significance of sustainability integration and the expanse of considerations using two measurement schemes. Our analysis suggests that sustainability integration into RFPs is currently superficial with limited integration into the evaluation process. We also found that the integration of sustainability was narrow with significant gaps in the breadth of environmental and social impact areas that were considered. As such, we provide insights and recommendations that will enable governments to accelerate the advancement of sustainability through the use of procurement. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The evolution of societies and food systems across the grand transitions is traced to show how nature and culture have been transformed along with the basic structures of power, politics, and governance. A central, but neglected, element has been the synergy between the creation of industrial institutions and the exponential, but unsustainable growth of the built environment. The values, goals, and strategies needed to transform and diversify these structures - generally and in terms of food and agriculture - are discussed in terms of: 1) the need to diversify and decentralize the built environment as we move towards a post-fossil fuel society; and 2) the need to transform industrial institutions. To help develop more sustainable and regenerative institutions it is argued we will need to re-embed culture and society in nature; re-embed science, technology, and economics in society and nature; and re-embed governance and politics in society, something that requires a rethinking of representative democracy. Also, since the reforms needed to democratize society and to democratize food systems are parallel and reinforcing, it is crucial that each of us thinks through the linkages and the potential synergies and acts constructively in each realm. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The purpose of this volume is to highlight the impacts on civic engagement of social capital, and its various component parts (trust, norms, networks and associations), in diverse parts of Asia. Addressing the pressing need for improved governance within the spatial, political and cultural realities in the rapidly transforming landscapes of Asia, the contributors to the book bring together interdisciplinary work that focuses on the ways in which civic engagement can link with social capital building. The goal of this volume is to inspire policy that recognizes that a vibrant society with access to rich stores of positive social capital requires civil society, alternate civilities and the state. The result is a dialogue on the interplay of social capital and civic engagement in socio-political contexts quite different from those found in the West. This book contributes to current discussions about the nature of social relations and their connection to politics and change and offers a unique lens into the validity of these important concepts in contemporary research across a variety of Asian settings. It will be of interest to social scientists across the board, especially those with an interest in Asia and Asian development. © 2012 Selection and editorial matter, Amrita Daniere and Hy Van Luong.

AB  - Guatemala is severely polluted with plastic waste, with open burning, illegal dumping, and leaking landfills causing widespread harms. What actions, this article asks, are local people taking to reduce this pollution? What, more broadly, does this suggest for the power of grassroots environmentalism to influence plastics governance in Guatemala? Drawing on fieldwork in 2023 and 2024, our study finds that local efforts to eliminate single-use plastics have been surging across Guatemala since 2016. Formidable political and industry forces, however, are limiting the scaling up of these efforts. This article, the first to investigate the politics of reducing single-use plastic waste in Guatemala, deepens the understanding of the agency and power of local people in the Global South to shape environmental governance while emphasizing the importance of accounting for the political and economic forces thwarting the scaling up of community actions. © 2024 Newcastle University.

AB  - Introduction: Municipalities have a key role to play in developing and implementing policy for sustainable consumption, yet the evidence on the extent of municipalities’ work in this area and the constraining and enabling factors they face in this endeavor is sparse. This study examines municipal policies for sustainable consumption and their implementation, using food consumption in Sweden as an example. Method: It combines data from a nationwide survey, policy document analysis, and a two-year in-depth investigation into two municipalities that serve as case studies. Results: Findings show that Swedish municipalities have several policies in place related to sustainable food consumption. They use multiple policy instruments to target specific areas of food consumption, and are positive about their current and potential impact in specific areas such as sustainable school meals and tackling food waste. However, municipalities face multiple challenges in delivering sustainable food consumption, including lack of resources and knowledge in some areas. If there is a lack of political support, it can also be a major inhibiting factor. The municipalities welcome national-level strategy, rules and regulations that are supportive of their goals. They rely on good data collection and strong networks and stakeholder relationships to enable their work. Discussion: Many of the latest recommendations for a comprehensive policy approach to sustainable food consumption are yet to be applied at the municipal level in Sweden. There was little evidence of the use of systems thinking and practices-based approaches for policy design for example. Likewise, strong visions and strategic approaches to food were also lacking. The least coercive, informative policy instruments remain most popular. However, this study did reveal several existing areas where there are strong policy foundations from which these approaches might be developed, such as innovative ways to engage different target groups and a suitable policy mix to deliver specific objectives. Tackling the identified constraints and expanding the enabling factors could further the work on sustainable food consumption at the municipal level in Sweden and provide insights for other countries and studies at the local level.

AB  - Executives who lead cities face considerable challenges. Cities are complex ecosystems comprising myriad interacting systems, including information systems, which are vital for their operation and prosperity. Recognizing the value that information systems can offer, significant investments have been made to acquire these systems and make cities smarter or more intelligent. However, many smart city projects have failed to deliver on their promises due to a lack of clarity regarding their overall goals. Smarter or more intelligent towards what end? This article provides a systems-inspired approach to urban planning based on the premise that a city is a self-organising, capital-creating ecosystem composed of a city's administration and the many organizations within its domain. As the city's keystone entity, the administration's role is to create capital that enhances the capital productivity of other ecosystem members and nourishes innovators to boost capital creativity. A capital improvement budgeting framework can specify the allocation of all forms of capital to promote symbiotic connections between the various entities within a city. A city stack is designed to guide a city's administration in cooperating with its self-organising ecosystem. A research agenda to foster capital creation by city leaders is also outlined. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Green transition by reducing CO2 emissions and curtailing the exploitation of natural resources while increasing renewable energy use and generation is one of the most important targets in sustainable development. This study investigated the impacts of women’s empowerment in politics on the green transition in developing countries. We applied a fixed-effects model to the panel data for 131 developing countries from 2000 to 2019. Our findings indicated that higher levels of participation by women in politics are likely to reduce CO2 emissions and reliance on natural resources. However, there was no statistically significant effect of women’s political empowerment on renewable energy consumption. Women’s political participation enhanced the transition towards sustainable energy sources such as geothermal and wind energy. We also found that the effects of women’s political participation on CO2 emissions were greater in countries with better political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption, and voice and accountability. This study contributes to the growing literature in feminism and environmentalism on the achievement of sustainable development. JEL Codes: J16, O13, P48 © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This article examines the multidimensional problem of energy poverty, focusing on its connections to climate change and its manifestation at rural and urban scales across selected European countries and Israel. The study examined 31 locations in eight countries with diverse geographical and economic backgrounds: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, North Macedonia, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia, and Israel. The article aims to understand how winter energy vulnerability in rural and urban locations in these countries could be identified using selected energy poverty indicators and how it evolves under the influence of climate change. A set of sociodemographic, infrastructural, and economic variables, combined with climate analysis, were selected and assessed for their impact on energy poverty. We found that energy poverty in most countries depends significantly on location and regional development. Due to a combination of factors influencing energy poverty, rural households tend to be more vulnerable. Furthermore, climate change consequences will likely leave rural areas more likely to experience energy poverty in the future. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Transitional peri-urban contexts are frontiers for sustainable development where land-use change involves negotiation and contestation between diverse interest groups. Multiple, complex trade-offs between outcomes emerge which have both negative and positive impacts on progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These trade-offs are often overlooked in policy and planning processes which depend on top-down expert perspectives and rely on course grain aggregate data which does not reflect complex peri-urban dynamics or the rapid pace of change. Tools are required to address this gap, integrate data from diverse perspectives and inform more inclusive planning processes. In this paper, we draw on a reinterpretation of empirical data concerned with land-use change and multiple dimensions of food security from the city of Wuhan in China to illustrate some of the complex trade-offs between SDG goals that tend to be overlooked with current planning approaches. We then describe the development of an interactive web-based tool that implements deep learning methods for fine-grained land-use classification of high-resolution remote sensing imagery and integrates this with a flexible method for rapid trade-off analysis of land-use change scenarios. The development and potential use of the tool are illustrated using data from the Wuhan case study example. This tool has the potential to support participatory planning processes by providing a platform for multiple stakeholders to explore the implications of planning decisions and land-use policies. Used alongside other planning, engagement and ecosystem service mapping tools it can help to reveal invisible trade-offs and foreground the perspectives of diverse stakeholders. This is vital for building approaches which recognise how trade-offs between the achievement of SDGs can be influenced by development interventions. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - CO2 emissions caused by urban residents' energy consumption arise from 1) transportation and 2) housing energy consumption. This energy consumption depends on the spatial population distribution of the city. The current study quantitatively examines the effectiveness of i) congestion tolls, ii) carbon tax, and iii) land use regulations on the social welfare and the reduction of urban CO2 emissions. Results show that the congestion tolls can increase the social welfare by about 85% of the increase in the first-best scenario, which is the best result among the three policies, and can reduce CO2 emissions from commuting and housing energy by about 22% and 3%, respectively. These results suggest that congestion tolling, which is primarily the Pigovian tax for congestion, not only internalizes congestion externalities, but also effectively reduces CO2 emissions through downsizing commuting distances and housing sizes. Nevertheless, we show that because any spending, including consumption of goods, generates CO2, how tax revenues are used is important for determining total CO2. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - As the Small Island Developing States of the Caribbean prepare to take climate change adaptation measures, there is a distinct possibility that the most vulnerable groups, especially the poor, women, indigenous, elderly, and children in rural and coastal communities are at risk of being marginalized. It is necessary to take into consideration the adaptation needs of these groups that are likely to be disproportionately affected due to inherent structural and social disparities. In this paper we focus on the need to ensure inclusion and social equity in adaptation planning as climate change issues disproportionately impact health, settlement, and livelihoods of these vulnerable groups. We also focus on climate change potential impacts on tourism, agriculture and fisheries sectors, which are the major economic drivers of these island states. Based on Caribbean region wide observations, we recommend priority areas including increasing community participation, local initiatives and filling critical socio-economic and livelihood data gaps, which policy makers need to focus on and incorporate in their climate change adaptation plans in order to ensure effective and equitable climate change adaptation. © 2009 by the authors.

AB  - Climate change-related extreme events such as floods have and will continue to present a great challenge to disaster risk management. There is a pressing need to develop a robust management strategy via enhancing the resiliency of the community, particularly in the context of complex urban environments, like Jakarta. Resilience is conceptualized within specific contexts and uniquely tailored to the targeted setting, yet research regarding the operational concept of a flood-resilient community in the context of Jakarta remains limited. This paper will elaborate this operational concept through understanding the desirable features and influential barriers of a flood-resilient community through the lenses of three main stakeholder groups: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate change adaptation (CCA), and development. It will also discuss the ways in which the synergies that exist across these groups can be enhanced. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were applied in this study, and multiple sources of data were used. The findings indicate that these groups share common views regarding the importance of human aspects being central to resilience building efforts. We argue there is an urgent need to shift the flood resilience building paradigm towards building community resilience from the people and to apply a collaborative governance approach to facilitate effective partnership between the actors involved. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Wildfire is on the rise. The United States is witnessing a spectacular increase in acres lost to catastrophic wildfires, a phenomenon fed by the generally hotter and dryer conditions associated with climate change. In addition to losses in lives, property, and natural resources, wildfires contribute thousands of tons of air pollution each year. Ironically, one of the most effective tools to reduce the incidence and severity of unplanned wildfires is fire. Prescribed, or controlled, burning reduces the buildup of vegetation resulting from years of wildfire-suppression policy. At present, the number of acres subject to prescribed burns falls far short of the optimal number needed to restore natural ecosystems and reduce damages from unplanned wildfires. Air-pollution law and policy is an important factor contributing to the under-provision of prescribed fire that has so far escaped in-depth treatment in the law and policy literature. After setting forth the relevant air quality framework, this Article argues that decisions regarding planned wildfire are marred by an anachronistic and inaccurate distinction between "natural" and "anthropogenic" fire. Rationalizing that unplanned wildfires are "natural," the federal government excludes pollutants from such fires from air quality compliance calculations at the same time it encourages states to vigorously control pollutants from "anthropogenic," prescribed fires. The result contributes to an undervaluation of necessary, planned wildfire. Wildfire air pollution policy is also hindered by governance structures that place air quality and resource agencies at odds with each other, and by state nuisance authorities that enable narrow local interests to shut down prescribed fire, all of which trump the broader public interest in reduced wildfire risk and healthier forests. This Article suggests several solutions to remove these distortions, including adopting a default rule whereby all wildfire smoke, of whatever origin, "counts" for purposes of air quality compliance. Together with adopting mechanisms to require air pollution and resource agencies to both participate in planned burning decisions and de-emphasize the influence of nuisance standards, this "smoke is smoke" rule will ensure that the air pollution policy better reflects the true costs and benefits of prescribed fire.

AB  - Global warming and the rise in extreme heat days elevate the risk of heat-related mortalities, particularly in cities due to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and vulnerabilities tied to housing, exposure, and health conditions. City planners can mitigate these effects through urban adaptive actions. UHI mitigation, however, needs to balance several goals: strategies that maximize temperature reduction or minimize their impacts may not be best for cost effectiveness, carbon emissions, environmental amenities, health impacts, or distributional outcomes. Here, we implement a multi-objective robust decision-making tool for heat mitigation—the City-Heat Equity Adaptation Tool (City-HEAT)—to identify potential heat mitigation pathways at neighborhood scales. We find that more expensive pathways tend to have larger benefits in reducing heat-related deaths, but that these pathways sometimes underperform against other alternatives on reducing inequality in mortality outcomes. Pathways that focus on tree planting, a popular and powerful tool for UHI reduction, were found to be expensive and less effective at reducing health disparities than more diversified pathways, if no specific measures are taken to target tree distribution for distributional benefit. The generated pathways can reduce Baltimore’s heat related mortality by 81–670 deaths in the next 50 years, considering different investment plans in the city’s neighborhoods. We also find that these results are relatively insensitive to expectations for future warming: pathways designed for high warming rates are similar to those designed for low warming rates, suggesting that general strategies for UHI mitigation can be robust to climate uncertainties. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Since their introduction, in 2015, United Nations (UNs) 2030 Agenda, and associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), has now become an integral part of nations’ longer term policies. From the very beginning, Norway has shown exceptional sensitivity and zeal in establishing the values of sustainable development in its governmental strategic planning. However, the cataclysmic developments in this area call to explore further the long-standing Norwegian positions and future strategies in meeting global sustainability undertakings. The aim of the article is to explore and discuss Norway’s sustainability governance regime, as has been formulated from 1987 until today. In this context, this paper draws on a systematic review and analysis of concepts, policies and laws stemming from Norway’s governmental documents framed by the principles of a socio-legal research approach. The findings suggest that Norway maintains a clear regulatory and visionary base sustaining, thus, a sharp focus in enhancing its sustainable development policies.

AB  - Concerning the social acceptance and realization of adaptation strategies, a raising awareness on the impacts of climate change among the population is indispensable, especially among young people as future decision makers. In this context, the article presents the structure and implementation of the environmental education project “Klimawandel findet Stadt” (Climate changeS cities), carried out in cooperation between the universities of Bochum, Heidelberg and Trier. The project shall facilitate the development of students’ evaluation and action competencies with regard to climate change consequences and sustainable adaptation strategies by using a new educational concept of climate change communication. It implies the design of learning modules with an emphasis on health and risk prevention, urban climate and planning, and urban ecology and biodiversity. External stakeholders, e.g. biological stations, environmental departments and municipal offices, are involved in the planning and implementation of the above mentioned modules leading to an enhanced cross-sectoral cooperation of institutions. The methodical approach of the project is based on the dialectical intertwining of a three-step approach of spheres, namely observation sphere, laboratory sphere and sphere of action. In the spheres, students are confronted cognitively and affectively with climate change. Thereby, students shall be enabled and motivated to understand, evaluate and communicate climate adaptation strategies. As the concept is so far only normatively justified, there is need for empirical evidence of its effectiveness. In order to address this need, three efficacy studies are designed. If the methodical-didactical concept proves to be efficient, it could be implemented as a new form of climate change communication in educational institutions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This article analyses the factors influencing stakeholder participation in municipal energy and climate planning, together with stakeholder experiences of participation in such processes. The article presents findings from a survey of 60 Swedish municipalities and detailed case studies of energy and climate planning in five Swedish municipalities to explore which stakeholders are involved, how and why they are involved, and the impacts of participation on both stakeholder experiences. The results of this study provide insight into the role of stakeholders in municipal energy and climate planning. The study proceeds as follows: the Introduction is followed by a discussion of theoretical perspectives on stakeholder participation and energy and climate planning. The Methods used to conduct the study are presented, followed by Results and Analysis. In the subsequent Discussion, the authors propose a conceptual approach that may assist municipalities in development of energy and climate strategies. The Analysis and Discussion inform Conclusions in which the authors advocate early and active stakeholder engagement in energy and climate strategy planning and emphasise the possible utility of their conceptual approach in supporting stakeholder participation. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Despite signing the Mayors Climate Change Agreement, few US cities have made significant progress in either climate mitigation or adaptation. For the most part, European cities have been more effective, albeit with assistance from the European Union and their national governments. Several of the most successful European cities have implemented eco-districts, which have offered many lessons for overall sustainability planning. Using Malmö, Sweden as a case study, we ask how planners and elected officials learned from implementing an eco-district, focusing on experimentation with new technologies and approaches to planning. We identify how “double-loop learning”, a term coined by Argyris and Shön, was at play in changing planning practice. As eco-districts are catching on in North American cities, there is much to be learned from European practice. © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - This collection of ten essays on Banaras, one of the largest urban centers in India’s eastern Gangetic plain, is united by a common interest in examining everyday activities in order to learn about shared values and motivations, processes of identity formation, and self-conscious constructions of community. Part One examines the performance genres that have drawn audiences from throughout the city. Part Two focuses on the areas of neighborhood, leisure, and work, examining the processes by which urban residents use a sense of identity to organize their activities and bring meaning to their lives. Part Three links these experiences within Banaras to a series of "larger worlds," ranging from language movements and political protests to disease ecology and regional environmental impact. Banaras is a complex world, with differences in religion, caste, class, language, and popular culture; the diversity of these essays embraces those differences. It is a collection that will interest scholars and students of South Asia as well as anyone interested in comparative discussions of popular culture.

AB  - The urgency to reply to climate change requires a governance perspective that connects multiple societal levels and sectors and involves a plurality of actors. Psychologists should take an important role in addressing the ongoing climate crisis, together with other practitioners, scholars, policymakers and citizens. This systematic review aims to show the contribution psychology has offered in the governance of climate change, illustrating how psychological scholarship is positioned in the interdisciplinary discourse on climate governance and the way psychological constructs and theories are implemented. Following the PRISMA guidelines, two electronic databases (APA PsycInfo and Scopus) were screened, and 52 publications meeting the eligibility criteria were included and thoroughly analysed. The literature at the intersection between climate governance and governance is relatively scarce, yet it covers different domains and scales of analysis. Psychological contributions are always integrated into a broader interdisciplinary discourse spanning from the environmental to the social sciences, yet a scarce theoretical specificity has been documented. We found an abundance of research on the determinants of pro-environmental behaviours, which often neglects context-grounded factors, while the relational and dynamic dimensions of governance concerning group processes and collective engagement are rarely taken into due consideration. We argue that psychologists should continue engaging in interdisciplinary collaborations to collectively craft climate solutions, especially focusing on citizenry’s active engagement. Deeper theoretical elaboration on the interface between governance and psychology is needed, particularly from an ecological and systemic perspective. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Adaptive management has been considered a valuable approach for managing social-ecological systems involving high levels of complexity and uncertainty. However, many obstacles still hamper its implementation. Law is often seen as a barrier for moving adaptive management beyond theory, although there has been no synthesis on the challenges of legal constraints or how to overcome them. We contribute to filling this knowledge gap by providing a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on the relationship between adaptive management and law in relation to social-ecological systems. We analyze how the scholarship defines the concept of adaptive management, identifies the legal barriers to adaptive management, and the legal strategies suggested for enabling this approach. Research efforts in this domain are still highly geographically concentrated in the United States of America, unveiling gaps concerning the analysis of other legal jurisdictions. Overall, our results show that more flexible legal frameworks can allow for adaptive management without undermining the role of law in providing stability to social interactions. Achieving this balance will likely require the reform of existing laws, regulations, and other legal instruments. Legal reforms can facilitate the emergence of adaptive governance, with the potential to support not only adaptive management implementation but also to make law itself more adaptive. © 2018 by the author(s).

AB  - Urban areas are currently facing the increasingly pressing issue of urban heat worldwide, which is being worsened by climate change and rising urbanization. As a result, there is a growing need for new approaches to enhance urban resilience and adapt to these challenges. The escalating occurrence and severity of urban heat events provide notable hazards, particularly to susceptible groups, necessitating proactive efforts to alleviate detrimental consequences. Therefore, this research addresses the inquiry, “What strategic approaches can be effectively employed to mitigate vulnerability and strengthen urban resilience in response to urban heat?” Thus, this study ascertains and examines approaches to enhance urban resilience, mitigate susceptibility, and implement adaptation strategies to combat urban heat. Utilizing the content analysis method, a comprehensive assortment of documents encompassing academic publications, policy documents, and reports was subjected to a systematic analysis employing the MAXQDA software. Databases searched included Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and a total of 72 studies were included in the final analysis. The research reveals a wide range of novel ideas and practical measures that can be implemented to improve urban resilience and mitigate vulnerability to urban heat. Urban greening strategies, heatwave early warning sys-tems, and community involvement projects have exhibited differing effectiveness, application, and adaptation levels in many urban landscapes and socio-economic circumstances. Additionally, this research emphasizes the value of using multidimensional, context-specific strategies to address the unique challenges and needs of diverse urban regions and marginalized communities. Furthermore, structural changes, legislative reforms, and community-based solutions may be necessary to manage complex issues posed by urban heat. Therefore, effectively implementing adaptation strategies is vital to effectively combating challenges caused by urban heat in urban areas. © 2024

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that the progress towards a Circular Economy (CE) model in the European Union (EU) necessitates the cooperation of all levels of government. Nevertheless, empirical research predominantly adopts a national standpoint, disregarding the role of regions. Employing a multilevel model and spatial econometric methods, we examine the factors influencing the expansion of CE in EU regions, considering both regional and national aspects. The findings indicate that the expansion of CE endeavours in the EU mainly depends on regional factors. The regional knowledge base favours the expansion of CE-related business, while national public policies fail to promote them. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to both a rapid urbanization trend since the 1950s and development differences between areas, population and investment have been accumulated in certain regions in Istanbul which has led to disordered, unhealthy and unreliable urban areas. Istanbul is located on a seismic belt and is at risk of substantial damage should an earthquake occur due to irregular urbanization. Several transformation projects have started to be implemented with the intention of improving this fearsome picture and to evaluate the damages that would occur in an earthquake. To achieve this, urban transformation plans and projects must be done taking into consideration historical places, areas at risk and small-scale plans. This study is an evaluation of the development of unplanned housing and urban transformation projects during the urbanization process in the Istanbul Historic Peninsula. The peninsula has been an important cultural and civilization centre between Eastern and Western civilizations for centuries and has been listed in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List since 1985. Despite this, no documentation of this important area has yet been carried out. In 2006 the Istanbul Greater Municipality's Directory of the Protection of Historical Environment initiated the "Historic Peninsula Project", which comprises a project area of 1500 ha and approximately 48,000 buildings in crowded and narrow streets. Also, this project included the documentation of all buildings in the area of the Historic Peninsula by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in 2006. The most challenging task was to build up a new production environment with modern technology in the very short time frame of two years. © 2010 Old City Publishing, Inc.

As the effects of climate change become more pronounced, there is an urgent need for effective and sustainable solutions to mitigate its impacts. While international efforts play a crucial role in addressing climate change, empowering local communities to take action through localized methods is key to building resilience and creating lasting change. In this chapter, we explore how empowering society through localized methods can help address climate change and foster sustainable development. © 2025, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article presents findings from a transdisciplinary research project on collaborative practices for the sustainable management of natural resources (SMNR) in Wales. Here, the legislation establishes that the national well-being agenda and the principle of SMNR in environmental governance must be achieved through collaborative and participatory practices, across sectors and organisations, including within the public sector. However, neoliberal and hyper-bureaucratic governance structures, characterised by a risk-adverse nature, do not allow public sector institutional actors to experiment and engage with such practices in their everyday work. This article discusses a collective experience of reflecting on, and challenging such oppressing neoliberal structures, through experimenting with alternative ways of doing and being together. The emerging community at the heart of this experience is composed of policymakers, practitioners, artists, and academics (including the authors), who together carved out a 'site of negotiation' to contest techno-managerialism and mere rational approaches to (natural resources) governance. In the course of this research, these actors began to collectively create and shape new and shared meanings of doing collaborative and cross-boundary work (as required by the Welsh legislation), based on relationships of trust, reflexivity, embodiment, and relationality. Reflecting also on our own experience (and interpretation) of working alongside them, we believe that such emergent processes of collective meaning-making have the potential to transform neoliberal (environmental) governance structures into 'lived' and 'owned' institutions. Inspired by relational, integrative and caring forms of democratic governance, we argue that professionals in public sector organisations can realign governance structures in ways that meet the challenge of enabling the rapid and wide sustainability transformations that are so desperately needed. © (2023), (University of Arizona Libraries).

AB  - The circular economy is not new to South Africa. As a country facing high levels of unemployment, poverty, and inequality, end-of-life products are often repaired and reused, driven largely by an active informal sector. As a water scarce country, grey water has been recycled and reused for decades, with returns making up 13% of South Africa’s available water. And facing an energy crisis since 2007, renewable energy has grown to 11% of South Africa’s energy supply. While there is certainly much progress still to be made in scaling-up activities in the waste, energy, and water sectors, this chapter provides insights into some of the initiatives already in place to catalyse South Africa’s transition to a more circular economy. In addition to the sector opportunities, the chapter also explores the role of government, business, and science, technology, and innovation in unlocking a circular economy in South Africa. It is acknowledged that further circular economy opportunities in resource-intensive sectors such as agriculture, human settlements, transport, and manufacturing need to be identified, and that more needs to be done in addressing “early stage” product design and resource demand. However, based on a growing body of knowledge, it is clear that the circular economy provides opportunities to address issues of national resource scarcity and security through sustainable resource utilisation. It provides opportunities to move the country forward in its local and international environmental commitments and development objectives. And it provides very real opportunities to strengthen local manufacturing, reduce dependence on resource imports, unlock new economic opportunities, improve the sustainability of other investment areas, create jobs, and position South Africa in the short term for a post-COVID19 green economic recovery and in the long term for a post-mining economy. © The Editor (s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021, corrected publication 2022.

AB  - This paper presents a general framework for modeling the growth of three important variables for cities: population distribution, binary urban footprint, and urban footprint in color. The framework models the population distribution as a spatiotemporal regression problem using machine learning, and it obtains the binary urban footprint from the population distribution through a binary classifier plus a temporal correction for existing urban regions. The framework estimates the urban footprint in color from its previous value, as well as from past and current values of the binary urban footprint using a semantic inpainting algorithm. By combining this framework with free data from the Landsat archive and the Global Human Settlement Layer framework, interested users can get approximate growth predictions of any city in the world. These predictions can be improved with the inclusion in the framework of additional spatially distributed input variables over time subject to availability. Unlike widely used growth models based on cellular automata, there are two main advantages of using the proposed machine learning-based framework. Firstly, it does not require to define rules a priori because the model learns the dynamics of growth directly from the historical data. Secondly, it is very easy to train new machine learning models using different explanatory input variables to assess their impact. As a proof of concept, we tested the framework in Valledupar and Rionegro, two Latin American cities located in Colombia with different geomorphological characteristics, and found that the model predictions were in close agreement with the ground-truth based on performance metrics, such as the root-mean-square error, zero-mean normalized cross-correlation, Pearson's correlation coefficient for continuous variables, and a few others for discrete variables such as the intersection over union, accuracy, and the f1 metric. In summary, our framework for modeling urban growth is flexible, allows sensitivity analyses, and can help policymakers worldwide to assess different what-if scenarios during the planning cycle of sustainable and resilient cities. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Visions of energy futures produced via co-created methodologies can provide robust alternatives to the prevailing imaginaries held by international and state actors – crucial for sustaining progress towards energy transitions that meet community needs and realities. This paper explores the co-creative design of a methodology for community visions for energy transitions. Insights are drawn from the development and outputs of a collaborative workshop aimed at adapting community visioning to different local contexts with four partners from across Europe. We analyse empirical evidence, including transcripts of conversations with participating local authorities and NGO representatives and resources prepared for the workshop, to detail how collaboration proceeded. The results highlight that practices fostering inclusion, mutual learning, and relationship building can give partners ownership over visioning to better ensure that its design reflects local, situated knowledges and is well suited to communities. However, the messy, human nature of co-creation requires commitment to flexibility and ongoing dialogue. Overall, the experiences highlighted in this paper serve as a valuable resource for future researchers and practitioners interested in exploring how to further energy system transformation and support community-driven local energy transitions. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The health and well-being benefits of nature contact are well known, but inequitably distributed across society. Focusing on the access needs of persons with a disability, the purpose of this study was to systematically examine research on the accessibility of nature-based tourism and recreation spaces outside of urban/community settings. Following a scoping review methodology, this study sought to examine policies, services, physical infrastructures, and regulatory standards intended to enable equitable use of nature-based settings by individuals of all ages and abilities, particularly persons with a disability. In total, 41 relevant studies were identified and analyzed. Findings indicate that there are considerable gaps in the provision of services and information that enable self-determination in the use and enjoyment of nature, and that accessibility in nature-based settings is conceptualized through three interrelated policy/design pathways: the adaptation pathway, the accommodation pathway, and the universal design pathway. As a whole, accessibility policy and standards research specific to natural settings outside of urban/community settings is highly limited. Management implications: There are growing calls to promote inclusive nature experiences in tourism and recreation spaces outside of community settings. Management of such spaces must reconcile equity concerns with a host of other priorities like environmental conservation. In the case of promoting universal accessibility, few studies offer insight into the detailed standards that must be met to create barrier-free access, let alone how to integrate such standards with other management priorities. Transdisciplinary research partnerships that involve management personnel, environmental and public health researchers, and persons with a disability are needed to identify effective management synergies. © 2022

AB  - Digital government is essential for modernizing public administration, enhancing citizen services, boosting government productivity, and encouraging transparency and citizen involvement. It plays a critical role in improving the management of natural resource rents by promoting transparency, accountability, and responsible governance. However, empirical evidence on the impact of digital government on natural resource rents is lacking. To plug this vacuum into the literature, the analysis tries to study the impact of digital government on natural resource rent from 2003 to 2021 by collecting data across many economies and dividing the data into five samples: Global, Asian, American, European, and African. For empirical analysis, the study utilizes the 2SLS and GMM techniques. The analysis's main findings indicate that digital government escalates natural resource rent globally in Asia, America, and Europe. Likewise, human capital and financial development also help to advance natural resource rent. Further, the trade causes the natural resource rent to rise globally in Asia, America, Europe, and the African model, while technology promotes natural resource rent in Global, American, and European models. In contrast, external conflict causes the natural resource rent to fall globally in America and Europe. From these findings, the study infers that policymakers should increase the role of digitalization in governance-related activities, particularly in the natural resource sector. © 2024

AB  - Has global environmental change impacted on the urban way of life and on urban policy? Research shows that climate change has become a major urban political issue, but what can one say about biodiversity? This paper will, firstly, examine the urban assemblage perspective, which presents itself as a new approach to urban theory. This approach has been criticized, but its remains valid as a way of making sense of emerging urban practices. Among these practices are urban policy on climate change and biodiversity. Secondly, the paper examines action plans on biodiversity in six Canadian metropolises. The conclusion asks whether taking into account global environmental change in urban planning leads to a new reshaping of large urban areas. Copyright © 2019 by the Institute of Urban Studies.

AB  - The problem of interaction between the economy and the environment gains special significance every year. At present, anthropogenic impact of industrial production on the environment has exceeded the sustainability limits of natural systems. Further conventional development of the economy is confronted with the limitations of the self-restoration potential of ecosystems: the non-renewable character of productive resources and the limited character of the environment to take production waste. The purpose of the paper is to identify the main directions for the implementation of national policies of sustainable development with account of the fundamental conceptual premise. The paper outlines the main principles, policies and scenarios for sustainable development and presents new components of environmental policy. The authors consider national strategies for sustainable development of the United States, China, Russia, the EU countries and pay special attention to the strategy adopted in the Netherlands. The paper determines the specific strategies features reflecting the interests of these countries' population and the role of national economies in world economic relations. The paper explores the possibilities of the SDG Index for the identification, assessment and comparative analysis of countries' actions to achieve the goals of sustainable development. Based on the results of the Sustainable Development Index for 2017, the authors carry out a cross-country analysis of the sustainability strategies of countries from the perspective of achieving sustainable development goals (SDG). It helps to identify the problems of using the index to track progress towards the SDG. Moreover, the article underlines the strengths and weaknesses of national sustainable development strategies of different countries, including Russia. It is shown that Russia has achieved high positions in eradicating poverty, with a significant lag behind other goals of sustainable development, especially such as the elimination of inequality, the provision of a healthy lifestyle, access to justice and the creation of effective institutions. Finally, the paper indicates the main directions of sustainable development in Russia. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Smart City (SC) has been a popular area of research and practice during the last decade. An in-depth examination of the existing literature reviews on SCs divulges the scarcity of studies classifying the literature into multiple themes and identifying the popular and less popular themes based on the number of peer reviewed research papers under respective theme. Hence, in this study, a descriptive literature review of 86 peer-reviewed papers on SCs has been conducted to bridge this gap. The findings demonstrate that themes such as SC services design and management, innovation and technology, and citizens’ engagement in design and development of SCs have been extensively studied, whereas, themes such as the social impact, governance and policy, and performance indicators and standards have received moderate attention. However, there are also less popular themes such as the implementation barriers and SC strategy. Further, this study provides a reference source to future researchers. It also delivers valuable information to the policymakers and government bodies, which are actively, involved in the SC projects. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2019.

AB  - The current period marked by addressing environmental sustainability challenges and the instability of government institutions has heightened the issue of food security, especially in developing countries as they work towards achieving Zero Hunger as highlighted in the Sustainable Development Goals. To assess the effect of environmental sustainability and government institutions on food security in West Africa with data from 1990 to 2021, two models have been deployed. The Generalized Method of Moments was deployed as the main model and while Two-Stage Least Squares was used as the robustness check. The findings of the study reveal that carbon emissions which represent environmental sustainability has no direct significant effect on food security, while government institutions has negative effect on food security. The study also reveals that income and urbanization promote food security, while renewable energy and population growth reduce food security. The findings of the study could be a reflection of the current political instability and attitude towards tackling carbon emissions mitigation in the region. Government institutions are encouraged to exercise authority without fear to implement policies that would encourage food security and restrict the use of high-emission technologies.

AB  - Despite the findings on global climate change presented by the scientific community, there remains a significant gap between its recommendations and the actions of the public and policy makers. So far scientists and the media have failed to successfully communicate the urgency of the climate change situation in such a way that long-term, comprehensive, and legally binding policy commitments are being made on the national and international level. This book examines the way the public processes information, how they perceive threats and other perceptual factors that have a significant effect on how and to what degree climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are supported. Understanding public risk perception plays a vital role in communicating the challenges of global climate change. Using a diverse range of international case studies, this book explores the nature of public perceptions of climate change and identifies the perception factors which have a significant impact on the public's willingness to support global climate change policies or commit to behavioral changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve urban resiliency. The comparative study of social and cultural factors, beliefs, attitudes and trust provides an international overview of best practices regarding the design, implementation and generation of public support for climate change policies at a global level. Offering valuable insight into climate change and risk communication, the book should be of interest to students and scholars of environment studies, politics, urban planning, and media and cultural studies. © 2016 Bjoern Hagen.

AB  - Cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change and climate extremes in part because they concentrate many activities, people and wealth in limited areas. As a result they represent an important scale for assessment and understanding of climate change impacts. This paper provides a conceptual and methodological framework for urban economic impact assessment of climate change. The focus of the paper is on model-based analysis of future scenarios, including a framing of uncertainty for these projections, as one valuable input into the decision-making process. The paper highlights the main assessment difficulties, methods and tools, and selected examples across these areas. A number of challenges are unique to climate change impact assessment and others are unique to the problem of working at local scales. The paper also identifies the need for additional research, including the need for more integrated and systemic approaches to address climate change as a part of the urban development challenge as well as the need to assess the economic impacts of climate change and response policy at local scale. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Reducing consumption in affluent urban households is perhaps the most important driver of future natural resource conservation. This article examines how water consumption in individual households is affected by income and determines whether household amenities or attitudes toward community and the environment mediate the effect of income on residential water use, net of other factors. We matched household social surveys, property characteristics, and climate variables with 24 months of individually metered water usage records for single-family houses in Phoenix, AZ. Household income had a positive, significant effect on consumption that was mediated by house size. Irrigable lot size and landscape type also had significant effects on consumption, although attitudes did not. In order to promote environmentally sustainable behavior we must develop better models of the social organization of consumption and encourage affluent households to be more attuned to the water affordances of their lifestyles. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In recent years, rising carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and other negative environmental effects of human activity have raised concerns about the planet's future. Rapid industrialization, urbanization, and economic activity have shown a surge in CO2 emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change. The main purpose of this study is to examine the impact of such as gross domestic product, gross domestic product square, foreign direct investment, environmental diplomacy, environmental diplomacy security, and renewable energy consumption on environmental degradation. This study provides a new perspective on environmental diplomacy in OECD countries using panel data econometric methodologies from 1991 to 2020. It contributes to our understanding of the role of environmental and economic factors in reducing CO2 emissions. The panel data is also analyzed by CD, CIPS, FMOLS, DOLS, and PMG-ARDL tests. However, as per the findings of this research, all the factors significantly impact environmental degradation (Co2 emission). Finding data to either confirm or deny the efficacy of the Environmental Kuznets Curve theory within the framework of OECD countries is possible through this approach. This policy framework attempts to solve the issues at the connection of environmental diplomacy and economic concerns by emphasizing cooperation and sustainability and incorporating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes in OECD countries. © 2024

AB  - Urban sustainable development is today seen as one of the keys towards unlocking the quest for a sustainable world. One feature of urban sustainability is the increased interest in developing sustainable urban districts. For many of these developments, guiding sustainability documents are developed to frame future goals. However, few of these documents specify on which grounds they determine the sustainability of goals and they are largely developed as independent islands of local sustainability. This is unfortunate as cities and their districts are fully dependent on surrounding environments. Failing to include a holistic approach into the local planning increases the risk of sub-optimisation, future lock-ins and missed targets on a higher level. The aim of this study is to analyse whether the environmental and sustainability programme for Stockholm Royal Seaport, a new urban district in Stockholm, Sweden, can guide development of the district towards holistic ecological sustainability. By using the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development a holistic template for an ecologically sustainable planet has been described, important sectors for the built environment have been identified and the environmental and sustainability programme for the district has been analysed. This study showed that the vision and operational goals put forward in the Stockholm Royal Seaport programme complies relatively well with the designed template. However, important deviations in all sectors but land use have been identified. These deviations arise in the translation process between theory and practice. The vision for the district and the implementation phase are not aligned due to too narrow a perspective of a sustainable urban district, lack of robust sustainability principles including use of such to identify key strategic questions. In addition to the lack of an all-embracing conceptual framework, there is also a lack of structures for cooperation between stakeholders and conflicts between local and regional agendas. Use of a unifying framework can describe desirable future scenarios where the local level does not contribute to violation of the universal sustainability principles and identify step-wise routes towards such scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Over time African cities and their residents have responded to climate impacts in increasingly creative ways, based on local knowledge and available resources. Overviews of adaptation policy, plans and actions have largely been lacking for Africa, particularly at the local, city level. We applied a systematic map to assess what the human responses to climate impacts are in African cities, noting the climate drivers of these actions, the range of responses, where they have taken place, and who the actors are. Standardized, pre-selected search terms were used to systematically search peer-reviewed and grey literature, using Web of Science, Scopus, and Google. Publications were screened based on pre-approved inclusion criteria, and actions described in included articles were coded using categories from key conceptual framing papers on climate change adaptation. Of 2 042 peer-reviewed and 60 grey-literature publications, 252 underwent full-text screening, with 121 included for coding. We recorded 1 504 actions, taking place in 41 cities from 21 African countries, in response to various climate drivers. Anticipatory and reactive actions were taken by actors, from individuals to international agencies, and we highlighted successful adaptations, those taking advantage of climate impacts, and maladaptive actions. Combinations of climatic and non-climatic stimuli induced adaptive responses, which were frequently based on local knowledge, and provided a base upon which government action could build. Residents of informal settlements had less adaptive capacity than those in formal settlements, and government action could build their resilience. Since development is affected by climate impacts, climate change information should be integrated into development programmes. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper draws on earlier research, a national review of Scottish SEA practice and a survey of practitioners and stakeholders engaged in SEA and spatial planning in one Scottish city-region, to explore claims being made in the academic literature for Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) as a tool for deliberative plan-making. We consider whether there is evidence that Scottish SEA practice is helping create more inclusive plan-making processes in light of recent legislative changes, thereby fulfilling one of the expectations of Scottish Government. The macro analysis found that although there are opportunities for stakeholders to engage in the Scottish SEA process the level in practice is extremely low, a finding which mirrors experience in England and elsewhere. The more detailed micro analysis reveals a more nuanced picture within the spatial planning system, however, suggesting the existence of two distinct spheres of public conversations, one characterised by active dialogue about the environmental effects of alternative strategies amongst public sector stakeholders and the other involving non-governmental stakeholders and community groups in a much more limited way. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible explanations for this outcome, concerning asymmetric incentive structures and the application of power, and a consideration of the implications in relation to the competing discourses of SEA. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The sub-Saharan cities are growing and changing due to immigration and modernization. One of the consequences of the current urbanization is that an increasing number of families residing in peri-urban areas of small rural towns lack access to basic municipal and ecosystem services. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the impacts of peri-urban expansion on municipal services provided by the governments and on ecosystems services through a case study of a small rural town called Makhado Biaba in Limpopo Province of South Africa. Makhado Biaba has been experiencing incessant rapid physical expansion over the years. Such spatial expansion into the peri-urban zone impacts the provision of municipal services such as water, electricity, sewerage, and refuse collection. In 2020, an exploratory mixed-methods study of some anthropocentric and ecosystem changes in Makhado Biaba Local Municipality in northeast South Africa was executed. Land use was mapped for the time period of 1990–2020, data were gathered through a household questionnaire in six villages, and interviews were held with municipal officials. Among others, the study showed that several municipal services are available in the peri-urban villages of Makhado Biaba Town despite the distant locations outside the urban core. However, services are not uniformly distributed due to that new peri-urban developments that are leapfrogging into vacant land without supporting infrastructure. The pace of the municipality in providing the necessary municipal services such as water and energy supply, as well as sanitation and refuse removal, is lagging behind the development of new and unplanned housing areas. The findings bring about information about the suburban livelihoods and how the administration of the peri-urban areas can respond to the needs of the inhabitants as well as to future challenges. For instance, to facilitate local development, recurrent and well-structured citizen dialogs with local groups to identify delivery failures are strongly recommended. In addition, the impact on ecosystem services by the city development and land use change stresses the need for guided urban development and expansion and also settlement upgrading programs in peri-urban zones to limit the bad effect on ecosystem services. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - This article discusses the potential of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to become an information technology enabling groups of people to participate in decisions shaping their communities and promoting sustainable use of natural resources. It explains the concept of participation in the context of planning and decision making. In this context Participatory GIS (PGIS) offers tools that can be used to help the public become meaningfully involved in decision making processes affecting their communities. Following an overview of research on PGIS and its current status the article presents two recent studies of PGIS in water resource planning; one involving the use of computer generated maps representing simple information structures and the other involving the use of more sophisticated information tools. The synthesis of both studies provides the bases for discussing the prospects of PGIS to empower citizens in making decisions about their communities and resources. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Governance of the estuarine social-ecological system is a challenge for policymakers and academicians. While local communities perceive estuaries as commons, the private sector values and uses them as a low-cost infrastructure for making economic profits. These conflicting perspectives have complicated resource uses between local communities and modern enterprises and led to the degradation of estuarine biodiversity. A critical examination of modern development experiences and estuarine resource management, however, reveals that the currently practised state-centric modes of estuarine governance are biased towards privatization and neglect local community needs and livelihood rights. A system of governance that guarantees sustainable development and ecosystem health and just shares estuarine resources to sustain community livelihoods is, therefore, essential. This paper identifies major challenges of the present estuarine governance strategies in Kerala and presents an alternate collaborative governance framework to ensure socially acceptable sharing of estuarine resources and ecological services between traditional and modern resource users. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In contemporary cities there is a range of spaces leftover from development, undeveloped or spaces abandoned post-development, derelict. These lie dormant between other functional spaces of the city, voids in-between the built urban environment that surrounds them. Often these are also temporary spaces: in-between what was there before and what will soon come. This temporary character may, however, be seen as permanent, for instance in the eyes of a generation of children growing up playing in leftover spaces over the period of a decade. This paper will investigate whether there is value in such spaces for everyday life and public space in the city. It will examine and determine their function in terms of three factors: ecological value, social value and open space value. It will highlight implications for planning policy, as well as funding, ownership and management issues.

AB  - This research aims to analyze in depth the political power of legal aspects of the branding of the city of Padang Panjang as the Kota Serambi Mekah. The focus of this research explains the reasons behind the branding of the city of Padang Panjang as the City of Serambi Mekkah at the beginning of its determination, the political power of legal (regulations and programs) in building and maintaining the city’s branding. This research uses a qualitative approach. The data sources collected are a combination of data on the law in the books with the law in practices. The interpretation of the data refers to the normative legal research procedure by confirming it to the understanding practices of the respondents. Data was collected through interviews with the mayor and his staff, and the community. While the literature study collected policy documents and the internet such as the Padang Panjang Government website. The empirical approach analyzes field data to explain Padang Panjang’s branding policy as the City of Serambi Mekah, while the normative approach analyzes scientific documents to explain regulations related to the branding. The results of this study show that the rationale behind city branding is to strengthen the Islamic and cultural identity of Padang Panjang City. In addition, although the Kota Serambi Mekah branding has been practically implemented through various regulations and programs, the consistency in the emphasis of branding in strategic planning has changed, from an emphasis on concrete implementation in the 2005-2045 Regional Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPD) to a more explicit emphasis in the Draft RPJPD 2025-2045. This research is novel in exploring the political power of legal in shaping and sustaining the branding of cities, particularly Padang Panjang as the Kota Serambi Mekah. The contribution of this research lies in an in-depth understanding of the role of legal and policy frameworks in strengthening the city’s cultural and religious identity, as well as how this branding can adapt to changes in long-term development strategies. This research also provides suggestions for the government to be consistent in maintaining the implementation of branding in every strategic planning, so that the identity of Kota Serambi Mekah remains relevant and effective in facing social and political challenges. © 2024, Universitas Islam Negeri Mahmud Yunus Batusangkar.

AB  - This study explores the interlinkages among population, environment and poverty and presents empirical evidence in a developing country like Pakistan. It gives alternative views on population environment linkages. It explains poverty trap, market based harmony, and dual effect of poverty on the basis of a link between population growth and natural resource degradation. In addition, the paper also highlights social and political instability through population-poverty-environment spiral. It also presents empirical evidence on population-environment-poverty nexus in Pakistan. It also compares environmental sustainability index and human development index for selected Asian countries. The paper also gives scores for different components of environmental sustainability index for Pakistan and compares these with India. The paper concludes that the causal relationship between poverty and environment works in both directions, often through changes in GDP and population. Population stress does not have any significant direct effect on all aspects of environmental status in Pakistan. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The study provides imperative evidence about the current emission control strategies, environmental planning, legislation, policy instruments, and measures to provide a sustainable environment for the present and future generations. The study followed a well-defined analytical methodology to analyse the measures adopted to control emissions as a trade-balancing tool for the environment. The findings indicated that domestic as well as the international collaborations were effective in controlling the present problem of environmental pollution, and suggested a need for collaborative agreements to amend the Environmental Protection Law (EPL). The analytical findings determined that the proposed EPL considered SO2 or NO2 emissions while neglecting an important source of environmental pollution, i.e., CO2 emissions. The research findings also suggested a need for to accelerate efforts in a more professional, practical, and result-oriented manner to analyse the diverse nature of environmental issues. The research highlighted some of the obstacles to the successful implementation of EPL for current and future environmental challenges. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Green economy is a concept frequently used by governments and international institutions to promote sustainable transformations of the economy. In this study, we explore how the transition towards a green economy is being conceptualised in policy terms in the three Nordic countries Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Comparing these cases, we analyse strategic policy documents on green growth, circular economy, bioeconomy, low-carbon transitions, and sustainable development. While comprehensive national policy strategies on the green economy are lacking, the studied documents display policy approaches that reflect different aspects of a green economic transformations, such as low-carbon developments, promotion of environmental technology sectors, and enhanced circularity. Our findings indicate the presence of a transformative Nordic model for greening the economy, in which the state plays an active role in supporting innovation and technology development, facilitating cooperation among societal actors, and securing social welfare and human wellbeing. It is underpinned by optimism about the opportunity to reconcile economic growth with sustainable development, while more radical beyond growth approaches are strikingly absent, reflecting their marginal roles in the established policy discourse of these countries. Rather, concepts such as circular economy, sharing economy, and sustainable production and consumption are highlighted as central for greening the economy. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) management has emerged as one of the major environmental challenges globally. The consequences of inappropriate waste management are manifold and the trend would continue if immediate interventions are not taken for its reversion amid rapid urbanization and current consumption patterns of individuals. The concept of circular economy (CE) can contribute to a paradigm shift in the transformation of the traditional linear approach that does not favour reuse, recycle, recovery concept. Modern and proven waste management practices with collection systems, recycling facilities, sanitary landfills, and waste-to-energy (WtE) and nutrient recovery offer opportunities to improve urban environment through the valorization of waste and by-products in a CE. This study scrutinizes the existing literature on the assessment of circularity and helps to develop a unified circularity framework in the management of MSW in cities. Key aspects such as tools for measuring circularity, nexus and trade-offs, and conditions in promoting CE are discussed. Finally, this paper elucidates the need for circularity, including enablers and inhibitors for promoting circularity in the management of MSW with a case study in the city of Curitiba, Brazil. © 2021 Dilip Khatiwada et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - As part of efforts to reduce carbon emissions, the concept of n-minute cities has been proposed. Although many global cities have attempted to implement this idea, there is still a lack of quantitative research on n-minute cities. This study aims to analyze factors that influence living radii by utilizing mobile phone location-based mobility big data and spatial regression analysis, thereby contributing to the implementation of n-minute cities. By distinguishing between pre- and post-COVID-19 periods and between commuting and non-commuting travel, this study reveals decreased average travel distances in the post-pandemic period and identifies factors influencing living radii, thereby favoring the concept of n-minute cities. During the post-COVID-19 period, the impact of factors such as population density, commercial facilities, and the job-housing ratio on travel distance has shifted, while neighborhood living and cultural facilities maintain consistent influence. This underscores the importance of prioritizing these aspects in n-minute city planning. Additionally, the mix of residential and business uses consistently affects shorter commuting distances, highlighting its critical role in n-minute city development. This study is significant for identifying urban environmental factors that effectively reduce living radii based on actual travel behaviors. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Abstract: By 2022, 42.39% of the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) population was living in urban areas. This urbanization correlates with increasing poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, environmental pollution, and the prevalence of informal settlements. These challenges worsened urban food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic in SSA cities. This review analyzed the role of urban farming system as a pivotal means to enhance urban food security, incorporating socioeconomic integration and environmental sustainability. The analysis is grounded in a systematic review using specific keywords, evaluating 46 articles and institutional reports related to the subject. The results revealed that 3.62% of SSA countries have implemented national urban governance and policies with minimal focus on urban farming. Rapid urbanization, urban population growth, and climate change are key factors contributing to cities' vulnerabilities to food insecurity in SSA. Predominantly characterized by horticultural practice, urban farming enhances the food supply system, nutritious security, jobs and income generation, reduces transportation costs, promotes the consumption of fresh food, and mitigates food loss in cities. Despite its importance, urban farming in SSA encounters several challenges: (i) urbanization governance and policy, (ii) knowledge and technology in urban farming, (iii) access to land and water, (iv) financing and capacity building for urban farming, and (v) environmental pollution. SSA countries need a coordinated mix of urbanization policies and technological advancements to integrate innovative urban farming methods, bolstering cities’ resilience to food insecurity. Implementing these measures could advance the achievement of sustainable development goals 2 and 11 in SSA cities. Core Ideas: Only 3.62% of sub-Saharan African countries implemented national urban policies, with little focus on urban farming integration. Limited technology and innovation, including land and water access, hinder urban farming productivity in SSA cities. Urban farming system is a nature-based solution that promotes food security, jobs, and climate resilience in SSA cities. To fully harness the benefits of urban farming, urban governance in SSA must incorporate it into cities' land-use planning. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - ‘Sufficiency’ has become a key term within sustainability science. The satisfaction of basic human needs for all and for multiple generations is only possible if coupled to the implementation of ecological ceilings that prevent wealthy groups from disproportionate production and consumption patterns and energy use. While much sufficiency research has focused on the poor and how to provide corresponding social floors (i.e. an adequate level of sufficiency), this conceptual paper theorises structural barriers to implementing ecological ceilings for production and consumption by considering research on elites. The argument is illustrated with examples from urban spaces that are increasingly structured to accommodate the preferences of economic elites. A better scholarly understanding of the structural barriers to sufficiency dissemination can be facilitated through a systematic account of the political, social and symbolic strategies deployed by elites to accumulate and legitimise power. Conversely, a consideration of sufficiency principles would also be beneficial for research on elites, which has so far focused on social inequality and sidelined the ecological crisis. The discussion highlights how research on sufficiency and elite consumption may interact to be mutually beneficial. A research agenda is proposed to understand economic elites as barriers to the dissemination of sufficiency principles. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Civic participation has an irreplaceable role in the land-use planning process because it contributes a practical perspective to expert knowledge. This article discusses whether there is actually a level of civic participation that can be considered optimal, which would allow experts to effectively obtain information from everyday users of the territory, who have the best practical knowledge of it; experts may also gain sufficient feedback on intended developments, based on knowledge about civic participation from representatives of individual municipalities. The article also proposes measures that can promote an optimal degree of participation in the land-use planning process. The fieldwork was conducted in the form of semi-structured interviews with the mayors of municipalities with a population of up to 2000 inhabitants in selected districts of the ústí Region (Czech Republic). The results suggest that the optimal degree of civic participation in land-use planning should have a representative extent, so it should not merely be a matter of individuals, but also one of groups of dozens of people, and such groups should encompass a balanced variety of characteristics; an optimal level of civic participation should also provide the maximum number of relevant impulses. Measures that may secure and foster an optimal degree of civic participation in land-use planning include (1) striving to avoid preferring purely voluntary participation; (2) simultaneously utilizing various tools to engage inhabitants; (3) educating inhabitants on a regular basis; and (4) consistently communicating and providing feedback, while also searching for informal means of communication and discussion. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - The Circular Economy in Europe presents an overview and a critical discussion on how circularity is conceived, imagined, and enacted in current EU policy-making. In 2013, the idea of a circular economy entered the stage of European policy-making in the efforts to reconcile environmental and economic policy objectives. In 2019 the European Commission declared in a press release that the Circular Economy Action Plan has been delivered. The level of circularity in the European economy, however, has remained the same. Bringing together perspectives from social sciences, environmental economics and policy analysis, The Circular Economy in Europe provides a critical analysis of policies and promises of the next panacea for growth and sustainability. The authors provide a theoretical and empirical basis to discuss how contemporary societies conceive their need to re-organise production and consumption and explores the messy assemblage of institutions, actors, waste streams, biophysical flows, policy objectives, scientific disciplines, values, expectations, promises and aspirations involved. This book is essential reading for all those interested in understanding how ideas about the circular economy emerged historically, how they gained traction and are used in policy processes, and what the practical challenges in implementing this policy are. © 2020 Zora Kovacic, Roger Strand and Thomas Völker.

AB  - Urban blue-green spaces provide us abundant social, environmental, and economic benefits, but the disparities often exist in their distribution and accessibility. Traditionally urban blue-green spaces are a consolidation of "blue-green infrastructure"within urban areas. Several urban features like parks, forests, gardens, visible water, such as parks, rivers, canals, reservoirs, ponds, lakes, fountains, etc. are categorized or considered under the blue-green spaces and these are very much crucial for various urban ecosystem services. These play a significant role for all stakeholders of the urban community. Thus, everyone must ensure the equitable number of blue-green spaces for all. Recently, several rules and regulations towards the safeguarding of urban blue-green spaces have been outlined. The work presents a methodological framework to develop an approach towards sustainable urban growth with the help of urban blue-green spaces assessments. The current work has attempted to examine the linkage between issues of the urban blue-green spaces for restoring the required infrastructures. It can be utilised for all sustainable urban development for urban planning and design projects to play a pivotal role. The work emphasizes more to develop a methodological framework to analyze the urban blue-green spaces for augmentation with a theoretical framework. It is expected that the advancement of a problem cum objectives-driven approach will help to design an impact-driven approach for planned and concrete action. © 2021 Sunita et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Purpose: Grassroots innovations, developed by local people using locally available resources, have shown the potential to provide low-cost technological solutions to the problems faced by underserved consumers in the global south. This paper aims to link the concept of grassroots innovations to energy use in the context of India. Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes three case studies from the list of technologies scouted and nurtured by the National Innovation Foundation to critically discuss the potential of grassroots innovations for the dissemination and diffusion of urban sustainable energy uses. The data for this study has been collected from various secondary sources. It discusses the opportunities and challenges in promoting grassroots innovations for sustainable energy uses in urban settings. Findings: The paper discusses the opportunities and challenges in promoting grassroots innovations for sustainable energy uses in urban settings. Originality/value: Although the concept and understanding of grassroots innovations have well developed, its linkages with sustainable energy use in urban settings have received scarce or no attention in the literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The demand for water, energy, and food resources increased in tandem with the world's population, industrialization, and urbanization. Anthropogenic sources of environmental pollutants degrade the water resources while population expansion contributes to rising demand for non-renewable energy resources which further enhances the greenhouse gas emissions. Also, maintaining the food security/-safety is another challenge which needs to be addressed for securing 'planetary public health'. The sustainability programs, pragmatic studies, and strategies from regulatory/scientific institutions attempt to reduce the depletion of these resources and mitigate environmental challenges however, the individualistic approaches proves to be inadequate. Therefore, the present review emphasizes the use of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus as a tool to combat environmental degradation, address climate action, and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this article, we investigate methodological paradigm and application of WEF Nexus in an inter-related framework through case studies on water resources, energy efficiency, urban food production, food waste reduction, cross-sectoral perspectives, and the circular economy. It has been widely observed that excessive exploitation of these resources influences the global food supply and demand, water availability, resilience in energy and socio-economic sector. Also, such perturbations in water, energy, and food sectors were found to be inextricably linked with climate change. The results further revealed that WEF nexus approach stimulates multilevel and inter-sectoral governance, thereby aiding to address the complexities and inefficiencies in achieving the SDGs. The prioritization of WEF Nexus strategy, especially under the event of COVID-19 can be a holistic approach to sustainably utilise natural resources to help achieve the environmental sustainability.

AB  - Community participation is increasingly embedded into environmental policy with the aim of accelerating transformative change towards sustainable management. A common approach to engaging with communities is through key stakeholders, who are still often selected ad hoc based on their activities. We tested an analytical approach for identifying distinct groups of community preferences as part of a case study to develop a community-led management plan for Blueskin Bay estuary and its catchment. We interviewed 36 community members to elicit their preferences for predefined management objectives following a standardised protocol. Using an agglomerative hierarchical analysis, we determined value-preference clusters for high-level management objectives and more specific objectives. At both levels combined, preference clusters were attributed to some of the commercial interests, such as cockle harvesting, forestry or tourism, which we also identified ad hoc based on their activities in the Blueskin Bay area. However, in addition, cluster analyses revealed five additional preference types: Urban Development Advocates, Cultural Environmentalists, Economic Environmentalists, Integrative Thinkers and those with Diverse Interests. We conclude that cluster analysis more objectively and specifically maps community preferences and, consequently, increases the robustness of collaborative environmental management processes, such as the one underway for Blueskin Bay estuary. © 2022 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

AB  - The energy industry strives to address a number of challenges—satisfy increasing energy demands, fulfill renewable energy policy requirements, and update aging infrastructure. Complicating energy projects are the controversies they can stir among stakeholders, sparking disagreements about environmental, economic, and aesthetic outcomes. Conflicts such as protests, petitions, or lawsuits can lead to schedule delays and cost overruns, which are difficult for project sponsors to predict. Using literature and news media, this study aims to identify trends in project controversies across energy projects. The study uses a mixed deductive and inductive content analysis to determine which actions, project phases, and stakeholders are discussed most frequently within both academic literature and news media. Using code cooccurrences, the study evaluates which stakeholders take specific actions at different project phases. Results show that the most active opposing stakeholders to energy development projects are community members, and actions opposing a project most frequently occur in the proposal phase. These results highlight the importance of engaging with communities early in project lifecycles. Opposition typically includes dissemination of information within communities, including letters to editors, internet newsletters, and public meetings. From this analysis, policy recommendations are provided for energy project sponsors to better anticipate and mitigate conflict. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Efforts to decouple environmental impacts and resource consumption have been confounded by interactions and feedback between technical-economic, environmental and social aspects not considered prior to implementing improvement actions. This paper presents a planning framework that connects material flows and the socio-economic drivers that result in changes in these flows, in order to reduce conflicts between localized gains and global losses. The framework emphasizes the need for (i) having different settings of system boundaries (broader and narrower), (ii) explicitly accounting for causal relationships and feedback loops and (iii) identifying responsibilities between stakeholders (e.g. producers, consumers, collectors, recyclers, policy makers). Application of the framework is exemplified using the case of the global mobile phone product system. 'Product design and development' and 'Retailers and users as part of a collection system' were identified as central intervention points for implementing improvement strategies that included designing for longer life, designing for recycling and improving collection, designing for limiting phone hibernation time and internalizing external costs. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Adaptation to climate change has been reviewed in several developed nations, but in none where consideration of the effects of climate change is required by statute and devolved to local government. We examine the role of institutional arrangements, the players operating under them, the barriers and enablers for adaptation decision-making in the developed nation of New Zealand. We examine how the roles and responsibilities between national, regional and local governments influence the ability of local government to deliver long-term flexible responses to changing climate risk. We found that the disciplinary practices of law, engineering and planning, within legal frameworks, result in the use of static mechanisms which create inflexible responses to changing risk. Several enablers are identified that could create greater integration between the different scales of government, including better use of national policy instruments, shared professional experience, standardised information collection and risk assessment methods that address uncertainties. The framing of climate risk as dynamic and changing that differentiates activities over their lifetime, development of mechanisms to fund transitions towards transformational change, are identified as necessary conditions for delivering flexible responses over time. © 2013, © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Given that climate change is a complicated collective action problem, local governments need a comprehensive approach to tackle climate change issues. Comprehensive climate policies concern an integrated approach in planning and implementing of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. Yet, not all local governments are actively engaged in global climate issues in a comprehensive manner. Why does local government's commitment on comprehensive climate change policy vary? This study analyzes the influences of urban climate change governance arrangements on the level of comprehensiveness in city-level climate change policies, using case studies of four cities. Urban climate change governance arrangement that includes researchers, NGO (Nongovernmental Organization) s along with public officials is a necessary factor for a city government to develop comprehensive climate policy. The case studies illustrate that cities with well-developed climate change governing organizations (Seattle and Seoul) present comprehensive climate change policy. Urban climate governance arrangements set the climate action agenda and promote implementation schemes. However, Anaheim and Busan have neither well developed urban governance arrangements nor comprehensive climate policies. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental governance is more effective when the scales of ecological processes are well matched with the human institutions charged with managing human-environment interactions. The social-ecological systems (SESs) framework provides guidance on how to assess the social and ecological dimensions that contribute to sustainable resource use and management, but rarely if ever has been operationalized for multiple localities in a spatially explicit, quantitative manner. Here, we use the case of small-scale fisheries in Baja California Sur, Mexico, to identify distinct SES regions and test key aspects of coupled SESs theory. Regions that exhibit greater potential for social-ecological sustainability in one dimension do not necessarily exhibit it in others, highlighting the importance of integrative, coupled system analyses when implementing spatial planning and other ecosystem-based strategies.

AB  - The promotion and use of the green housing is an important way to reduce building energy consumption and achieve emission reduction targets. Based on the perspective of generalized trust, starting from the internal psychological factors and external situational factors, the research model for the influencing factors of urban residents' willingness to pay for green housing is systematically constructed. And the first-order and higher-order moderating effects of generalized trust and the boundary conditions influencing the effect are explored. The results show that, for internal psychological factors, generalized trust has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between green residential cognition and willingness to pay, but it is vulnerable to the negative influence of loss aversion psychology. Generalized trust has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between residents' environmental concern and willingness to pay, and is susceptible to the positive influence of residents' advertising appeals (source reliability appeals and self-interest appeals). Generalized trust has a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between residents' moral identity and willingness to pay, and is easily affected by residents' high construal level. For external situational factors, generalized trust has a significant positive regulating effect on the relationship between social atmosphere/group pressure and willingness to pay. And the authoritative certification mark helps to increase residents' initial trust in green housing, and promote the formation of social atmosphere in which residents actively purchase green housing. Suggestions are provided at the level of government, developers and individual residents based on the empirical research conclusions. © 2021, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

AB  - The emergence and development of inclusive finance has made it possible for more economic entities to have easy access to a wider selection of financial services. This shift has significantly addressed the financial challenges inherent in the process of urbanization, making it a driver of the process of urban development. Therefore, this paper provides empirical evidence on the relationship between financial inclusion development and urbanization construction in China using provincial data and a panel-VAR model. The results show that: (1) There is a significant co-integration relationship among inclusive finance, urbanization, government support, and real estate development. (2) Inclusive finance has a long-term positive impact effect on urbanization. (3) Population urbanization has a positive impact on inclusive finance, but income urbanization has a negative impact on inclusive finance. To effectively promote the development of inclusive finance and urbanization, the following measures are of utmost importance: Firstly, while accelerating urbanization construction, it is necessary to expand and enhance the coverage of financial services. This will ensure that multiple regions can benefit from financial services. Secondly, to meet the diverse needs of different regions, more targeted financial products should be developed, making full use of the advantages of inclusive finance. Lastly, the government should strengthen its supervision of financial institutions and reduce the risks associated with inclusive finance, thereby ensuring a positive interaction between inclusive finance and urbanization development. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Despite high rates of out-migration, Mexican indigenous communities play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation. However, little is known about migrants’ role in environmental management. This research brief explores the case of the Purépecha of San Pedro Ocumicho, Michoacán, and its transborder community in the Coachella Valley of California. We find that migrants maintain strong cultural ties to their community of origin. However, many are undocumented, are unable to access steady and well-paid employment, and would be unable to return to California were they to visit Mexico. Furthermore, government structures in Ocumicho are weak, providing few opportunities for migrants to contribute. These factors currently preclude migrants from influencing environmental decision making in their home community. Our findings point to the need for more comprehensive and longitudinal studies to better document and explain the variations in migrant support for environmental governance in their communities of origin. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - With the expansion of the digital information industry, the size of global data centers is exploding. As part of a high-energy-consuming industry, data centers can support sustainable urban development through green transformation. This study uses a quasi-natural experiment of China’s national green data center pilot policy implemented in 2015 to examine the impact of data center green transformation on green technology innovation in cities. Using a difference-in-difference (DID) analysis, this study finds that the national green data center pilot policy leads to higher levels of green technology innovation in cities, but the spillover effect of the policy on neighboring cities is insignificant. The mechanism test showed that the national green data center pilot policy could facilitate urban green technological innovation through capital deepening, market competition, and industrial agglomeration. In addition, the policy impact is more pronounced for cities with poorer environments, less civilization, high levels of network infrastructure, and more innovative endowments. The findings can provide new guidance for cleaner regional production from the standpoint of data center green development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The pandemic has promoted an accelerated socioeconomic transformation enabled by digital transition generating a “new normal” and raising new potentials for responding to the grand challenges of climate change mitigation and creating net-zero neighbourhoods. Urban governance is crucial to realizing the full benefits of the twin digital and green revolutions promoted by visions of the 15-min city and liveable neighbourhoods. However, delivery of the 15-min city as a net-zero neighbourhood depends on effectively securing “win–win” policy co-benefits supporting climate change mitigation actions from a top-down perspective, allied to bottom-up open governance promoting co-design and co-development of urban plan solutions. This chapter outlines the concept of a smart urban governance model that deploys satellite-derived (Copernicus) intelligence to promote enhanced ICT-enabled tools. The model combines top-down and bottom-up urban planning processes in delivering climate change mitigation commitments at the urban scale. Finally, the chapter addresses research questions concerning the relevance of this Smarticipate as an open, integrated, and interoperable urban governance and planning model. The conclusions reflect the application of a digital-twin ensemble with Copernicus-derived methodologies, for the development of new models in the future new normal. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Under the dual pressures of climate change and human activities, the restrictions imposed by conservation policies, along with the increasing overlap between wildlife protected areas (PAs) and community living areas, have intensified the contradictions and conflicts between PAs and surrounding communities. Effective governance of such conflicts is particularly crucial to reconciling the contradictions between conservation and development. This study takes the Mikumi–Selous areas in Tanzania, Africa, as a case study. Through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, it explores the current state of conflicts between PAs and communities in the study area and summarizes conflict governance measures. Moreover, this research focuses on identifying various factors that influence the conservation willingness and action of community residents, further validating the relationships between residents’ household characteristics, conservation costs and benefits, conservation cognition, willingness, and behaviors through empirical analysis methods. The results indicate that residents’ conservation cognition significantly positively impacts their conservation willingness and behaviors, while conservation willingness also positively affects their conservation behaviors. Additionally, it was found that conservation costs inhibit residents’ conservation willingness and behaviors. This study primarily explores, from a community governance perspective, the participation willingness and behaviors of core stakeholders in conflict governance, emphasizing the critical role of community involvement in achieving biodiversity conservation and coordinated community development and providing a new perspective for alleviating conservation and development issues. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This chapter summarizes urbanization and its consequences to the environment. As more people concentrate in cities and as the urban population is increasing, serious environmental challenges arise which need to be tackled. This chapter describes the impact of urbanization on transport and land use. Furthermore, the problems related to water resources, waste management, and air pollution are discussed. The discussion is complemented with interesting case studies from all over the world. The concentration of people in cities needs to be tackled by appropriate planning and through effective management. In many cases, environmental problems of the past have been successfully dealt with, but there are still many challenges to be addressed at a local and global level in the future. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Capacity-building has long been recognized by African countries as one of the principal issues to be urgently addressed in order to support national and regional initiatives to effectively implement the provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in ways that contribute to their efforts aimed at achieving sustainable development. This chapter briefly outlines the ecological and socio-economic impacts of projected climate change on Africa, and identifies the key capacity-building needs and concerns of African countries as described in their national communications, as well as in published literature. These needs include the capacity to (i) prepare national inventories of greenhouse gases; (ii) assess impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change; (iii) undertake greenhouse gas mitigation analysis in major sectors of the economies; (iv) elaborate on education, training and public awareness programmes; and (v) cooperate in the development and transfer of climate friendly technologies. Other needs relate to capacities to mainstream the adaptation to climate change and thereby integrate the implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures within the framework of implementing national sustainable development plans and strategies. Since the process for preparing national communications was not designed as the principal vehicle for identifying capacity-building needs and concerns, some of the needs identified within the initial national communications lack specificity and clarity of prioritization in the context of national Climate Change and Africa, ed. Pak Sum Low. Published by Cambridge University Press. _c Cambridge University Press 2005. development priorities. Additional financial support provided to African countries by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) since 2002 within the framework of the national capacity self-assessments may enable countries to further identify and prioritize their capacity-building needs and concerns for the implementation of the Convention, while exploring areas for synergies to support the implementation needs of other global environmental conventions from a development perspective. There is an urgent need for adequate and predictable bilateral and multilateral assistance to help build the human and institutional capabilities of African countries to fully utilize the opportunities offered by the UNFCCC to advance the process of achieving sustainable development. African countries must therefore evaluate their options more closely and provide the needed political, financial and institutional support so that capacities built with donor support to address climate change would be sustainable. © Cambridge University Press 2005.

AB  - This article compares the current state of cycling in London to the Amsterdam cycling transition of the 1970s, applying the Multi-Level Perspective to identify potential pathways and obstacles to the wider adoption of the cycling niche in London. Our approach is two-pronged, consisting of a historical perspective to analyse the cycling transition in Amsterdam, and a policy analysis in contemporary London, based on semi-structured interviews with respondents involved in London's cycling policy. We identify factors that reinforce cycling's niche status in London, thus making the wider adoption of cycling more challenging than it was in Amsterdam. Based on our comparison, we also highlight policy, infrastructure and cultural changes that will aid in promoting a cycling transition in London. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The adverse health effects from hot weather and heat waves represent significant public health risks in vulnerable areas worldwide. Rising temperatures due to climate change are aggravating these risks in a context of fast urbanization, population growth and societal ageing. However, environmental heat-related health effects are largely preventable through adequate preparedness and responses. Public health adaptation to climate change will often require the implementation of heat wave warning systems and targeted preventive activities at different levels. While several national governments have established such systems at the country level, municipalities do not generally play a major role in the prevention of heat disorders. This paper analyzes selected examples of locally operated heat-health prevention plans in Japan. The analysis of these plans highlights their strengths, but also the need of local institutions for assistance to make the transition towards an effective public health management of high temperatures and heat waves. It can also provide useful elements for municipal governments in vulnerable areas, both in planning their climate change and health adaptation activities or to better protect their communities against current health effects from heat. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Many planning agencies worldwide now see climate change response as unavoidable. This paper proposes that a central task for contemporary planning theory is to guide planning practice as it develops multi-dimensional responses. We examine three theoretical constructs: anticipatory governance, legitimacy and social-ecological resilience. We argue that each conceptualises challenges climate change presents to planning practice, while providing theoretically informed options for responses. Building on this, we utilize Friedmann’s [2008. “The Uses of Planning Theory: A Bibliographic Essay.” Journal of Planning Education and Research 28 (2): 247–257. doi:10.1177/0739456X08325220] tasks for planning theory as a framework to assess the utility of planning theories to guide climate change response through practice. Associated issues are discussed, including the influence of translatable planning theories and the value of importing knowledge from other disciplines. The paper concludes that more sophisticated interplay between planning theory and practice may improve planning responses to the climate change threat. The need for planning theory to translate its conceptual discoveries to the domain of practice is key. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Systems-based frameworks offer a promising opportunity to integrate smart and green city approaches to create positive contributions to urban sustainability. In particular, digital public participatory GIS (PPGIS) presents a tool for combining technological approaches to urban planning with an agenda for more just nature-based solutions (NBS) by elucidating community voices and subjective perspectives. In this study, we investigate the potential for PPGIS to support more just and inclusive planning and implementation of NBS in a marginalized housing area (Hørgården) in Copenhagen, Denmark. Combining digital PPGIS with qualitative approaches, we identify residents’ meaningful places, narratives about community priorities and needs, and relational values expressed therein. We identify three key findings: (1) an absence of demographic difference in meaningful places identified in Hørgården; (2) a core-periphery structure in the presence of relational value and distribution of sites identified as unsafe or in need of care that is the inverse of that found in Danish policy discourse, and (3) the essential role of qualitative, community-engaged, and reflexive approaches to PPGIS in deriving these results. Based on these findings we conclude that smart technologies like digital PPGIS, framed within systems-based approaches and utilized in locally sensitive and responsive ways, can contribute to more just NBS for sustainable cities by connecting local neighborhood experience to municipal planning and policy agendas. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The topic of urban life and the ambient in smart cities, learning cities, and future cities is a timely one, fitting as it does in the world today by responding in an interdisciplinary way across many areas of research and practice. It is essential for researchers to think about and engage with the notion of flourishing in increasingly challenging environments in smarter ways. Urban Life and the Ambient in Smart Cities, Learning Cities, and Future Cities expands upon explorations of urban life to the ambient. As such, perspectives are offered in this work on urban life in the context of smart cities, learning cities, and future cities, enriched by understandings of the ambient, infusing the interactions of people and technologies in 21st-century environments with increased awareness, at the moment. Covering topics such as ambient learning, smart homes, and extended realities, this premier reference work is an essential resource for students and educators of higher education, architects, urban planners, instructional designers, sociologists, city officials, community leaders, librarians, researchers, and academicians. © 2023 by IGI Global.

AB  - Sustainable Action and Motivation proposes individual competencies and institutional policies that can help overcome the motivational hurdles that hamper sustainable action. Following the Paris Agreement of 2015 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the political momentum urgently to begin the drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has increased significantly. Affluent, high-income OECD countries are expected to take the lead in the global transition to a low carbon society. Given this, we need a better understanding of the motivational problems that people in affluent countries face with acting sustainably. This book investigates the above questions by analysing three fundamentally different perspectives: individuals and their motivation to act sustainably; institutions who take responsibility for issuing policies that steer us towards taking sustainable action; and humanity, each individual member of which ought to understand his or her non-sustainable behaviour in relation to the continued existence of the collective of human beings. Using theories from empirical psychology and a phenomenological approach to the research, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of practical philosophy, psychology of motivation and environmental psychology, as well as policymakers looking for ways to implement effective policies that encourage pro-environmental behaviour. © 2020 Roland Mees.

AB  - Growing global scarcity of water is forcing a change in their management models and the need to implement good governance schemes, understood as the implementation of legal, institutional and economic mechanisms that enable the efficient organisation of the activity developed by all of the agents involved in water management. In this sense, one of the greatest achievements in Spanish hydraulic history is the organisation called Mancomunidad de los Canales del Taibilla (MCT), whose existence usually goes unnoticed in one of the most arid regions of Europe: the South-East of Spain. Therefore, this study will analyse the MCT management model, based on the good governance of water, as well as their positive socio-economic impacts on population and areas supplied as a consequence of the quality and continuity of the urban supply, which has been extraordinarily beneficial for resolving health and hygiene and comfort problems. This is all thanks to the continual search for new sources of supply, in addition to efforts to improve leakage control, modernisation of management, educational campaigns implemented and the efficient and sustainable use of resources without financial unbalances. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper explores what the San Diego region may look like in the year 2050 as projected changes in regional climate conditions take place. Focusing on interrelated issues of climate change, sea level rise, population growth, land use, and changes in water, energy, public health, wildfires, biodiversity, and habitat, the paper reviews the potential impacts of a changing climate by 2050 and makes recommendations for changes in planning processes at the local and regional levels to prepare for these impacts. The original research for this study was completed in 2008 by a team of 40 experts from the region including universities, nonprofit organizations, local governments, public sector agencies and private sector entities. This paper has now been updated with more recent research regarding climate change adaptation while preserving the integrity of the original research team's work. The simulated impacts discussed in this study are based on regional projections of climate change generated by scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, employing three climate models and two emissions scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The impacts are discussed in the context of significant regional growth expected during the period as well as an aging population base. Key issues explored in the report include potential inundation of six selected low-lying coastal areas in San Diego due to sea level rise, potential shortfalls in water deliveries, peak energy demand increases due to higher temperatures, growing risk of devastating wildfires, migrations of species in response to higher temperatures in an increasingly fragmented natural habitat, and public health issues associated with extreme temperature events.

AB  - This article argues that the protection of ‘community interests’ in international law includes intertemporal obligations of States, in cases where it is scientifically foreseeable that preserving the ‘status quo’ of a protected community interest is increasingly unlikely. The argument is developed for climate change as a ‘common concern of humankind’ and based on the premise that even if a temperature limitation of 1.5°C would be achieved towards the end of this century, future generations will nevertheless live in a world that has fundamentally changed due to current policy and law choices. The article introduces the new concept of ‘intergenerational preparedness’ to operationalise and expand the normative scope of the principle of intergenerational equity. While some argumentative structures will be examined where intergenerational preparedness can be given effect through legal interpretation, the expectation that States must adopt preparatory measures to account for their community interest obligations deserves a more explicit recognition. It is a matter of the (environmental) rule of law to protect community interests on a time continuum, and this encompasses measures to prevent the deterioration of protected interests and to prepare communities for foreseeable detrimental changes. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The aim of this study is to contribute to the growing research on the effect of female political empowerment and quality of life. In particular, we explore the relationship between women’s parliamentary representation and sustainable development goals using cross-country spanning from 2015 to 2019. We find that an increase in the seat share of women in parliaments is positively and significantly related to SDGs. This relationship remains intact even after we introduce potential mediating channels and confounding factors. Moreover, using the instrumental variable regression method, we find that women in parliament are positively and causally related to sustainable development goals. © 2021, The International Society for Quality-of-Life Studies (ISQOLS) and Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Circular Economy regulation is rapidly adopted at different levels of governance, including municipalities, private and industry standards, national law and supranational standard-setting. There are increasing demands from policymakers, businesses and civil society for theoretical insights and more knowledge on the effects of policies and laws ('policy learning'). However, despite this mounting interest, the literature still lacks a real strand of studies that systematically and comprehensively addresses this area of research. The chapter offers a review of the origins and limitations of the current model of regulation and the emergence of a law of the Circular Economy in Europe. We maintain that the policy and academic debate is currently too fragmented, depoliticised and undertheorised, highlighting existing gaps and new research directions. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Public participation is supported in Thailand with any activity that may impact on the environment and people. This study examined model, strength and barrier factors, and the results of an application of public participation in the decision-making regarding the environmental impacts of poverty alleviation in a case study of the Queen's poverty alleviation projects, Hau Pa Khieo, Phatthalung province, Thailand. The public participated mainly in group discussions with the other professional organisations, and they were being consulted through in-depth interviews and by giving basic information through observation and secondary data. Within the Typology of Participation in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) model, this public participation could be classified as interactive participation. That is, the poverty alleviation policy was originally one of the Royal Development Projects; the environmental committee was formed to include the external and local representatives. They worked together, discussed together, and finally made a decision together using both technical and value judgments. However, the barriers to participation were the domination of the process by the interest groups, and the women's lack of confidence compared to the men's to present their opinions. Although this project did not succeed in all the activities expected in the original plan, the product improved the quality of the monitoring process; in addition, it was responsible for ensuring that the project was, for example, more responsive to public preferences and concerns, and addressed the relevant issues perceived by all stakeholders. © Common Ground.

AB  - Implementation of climate-smart livelihood strategies in communities is central to reducing impacts of climate shocks. Although the communities are vulnerable to climate variability, the magnitude of vulnerability depends on the choice of livelihood strategies being implemented. This paper applied a realist synthesis method to evaluate peer-reviewed literature on climate-smart livelihood strategies pursued in southern Africa in general and eastern Zimbabwe in particular. A holistic analysis of all climate variables was applied to adequately assess rural and urban communities’ adaptive strategies at micro-level. Accordingly, this review gave a nuanced analysis of vulnerability that frames the context in which communities’ livelihoods are affected by the increasing climate variability and extreme events. The review highlighted agriculture that involves forestry, crop and livestock farming as the predominant livelihoods in rural communities while crop farming and petty business dominates the informal economy as the core livelihoods in urban communities. Literature established the transformation of agriculture to climate smart practices that increase productivity and enhance the resilience of livelihoods. However, climate smart agriculture practices are not entirely new concepts. Most communities have always engaged in a variety of unorthodox farming methods to combat the impacts of climate variability and induced food insecurity. Given the right financial, technical and policy support, the communities are capable of constructing climate-smart livelihood strategies that are context specific. Fundamentally, the paper recommends that public and private institutions should develop capabilities to assess the impacts of climate related scenarios on vulnerable social groups to empower them to formulate bankable livelihood projects. © 2020 The Society of South African Geographers.

AB  - Despite the prevailing national support for renewable energy development, the installation of wind energy turbines at the local level is often met with resistance. Opposition is commonly attributed to NIMBYism (Not-In-My-Back-Yard), which implies selfishness, ignorance, and irrationality on behalf of residents. This article examines the factors that lead to community support and opposition. Based on an in-depth literature review and surveys conducted in three Massachusetts towns, the author discards NIMBY as a valid explanation and proposes a novel framework (VESPA) for organizing community concerns into four categories-visual/landscape, environmental, socioeconomic, and procedural. By comprehensively assessing local concerns, VESPA seeks to help policy makers approach communities more effectively and thereby achieve wider acceptance of wind installations. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Recent debates about the concept of planetary boundaries recall longstanding concerns about whether ecological limits are compatible with ecological democracy. The planetary boundaries framework (originally set out in Rockström et al., 2009a, 2009b) defines values for key Earth-system processes such as climate change and biodiversity that aim to maintain a ‘safe’ distance from thresholds or levels that could endanger human wellbeing. Despite having a significant impact in policy debates, the framework has been criticised as implying an expert-driven approach to governing global environmental risks that lacks democratic legitimacy. Drawing on research on deliberative democracy and the role of science in democratic societies, we argue that planetary boundaries can be interpreted in ways that remain consistent with democratic decision-making. We show how an iterative, dialogical process to formulate planetary boundaries and negotiate ‘planetary targets’ could form the basis for a democratically legitimate division of labour among experts, citizens and policy-makers in evaluating and responding to Earth-system risks. Crucial to this division of evaluative labour is opening up space for deliberative contestation about the value judgments inherent in collective responses to Earth-system risks, while also safeguarding the ability of experts to issue warnings about what they consider to be unacceptable risks. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Starting from the paradox of well-known green space benefits on the one hand and multiple challenges to their fair provision on the other hand, the book argues to put green space contestations and environmental justice concerns into focus when striving for a sustainable city development. As the edited volume unites interdisciplinary and multi-method studies on green space use and planning, it enriches environmental justice studies by widening the understanding of green space access, critically evaluating cases of procedural injustice and providing in-depth studies on the contexts of injustices in urban greening. Based on the results of these studies, a future research agenda is proposed in this introductory chapter. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Urban development is a current priority in terms of improving the sustainability of cities amid demographic pressure and intensive economic development in the European Union. In this context, we aim to critically analyze the progress achieved by the European Member States in the period of 2010–2022 from the perspective of Sustainable Development Goal 11—Sustainable Cities and Communities—and conceptualize the new development scoreboard from the perspective of SDG11. The methods used consist in applying principal components analysis for a set of 15 sustainability indicators related to the studied objective and designing the new sustainability index from the perspective of the ODD11 and the European ranking. The results of the study will allow for the formulation of public policies useful for European decision makers to improve the progress made relating to this objective, and we believe that their implementation could support the transformation of European cities in a sustainable and equitable way. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The relevance of the topic is confirmed by the compliance of the study with the sustainable development goals formulated at the UN Summit, and the development of socially oriented spaces design in Russia, based on an analysis of the preferences and opinions of the residents. The subject of the research is modern digital technologies and a participatory design in the formation of public spaces in towns. Aim of the work: development of tools for participatory design in the formation of urban public spaces in towns; analysis of methods and tools of participatory design. The scientific and scientific-practical significance of the work lies in: generalization of the world and Russian experience of participatory design; in identifying approaches and methods of participatory design; in developing a methodology for creating a trusting environment in the design of public urban spaces in small towns. The results of the work are presented in the form of academic reflection of both local and worldwide experience in the use of participatory design tools, the analyzed techniques and methods used in participatory design, the described type of experience in the use of participatory design tools in the area improvement project in Kingisepp, Leningrad Region. The authors came to the conclusion that effective digital methods of participatory design should include: targeting in social networks; mailing by e-mail and in private messages; activities on the development of the territory; film screenings, lectures; a post in the official accounts of the administration in social networks; survey on a dedicated website. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - India’s population of 1.21 billion (in 2011) makes it the second most populous country in the world. About 31% of India’s population lives in urban areas and the urban population has exhibited a higher decadal growth rate (31.8%) than its rural counterpart (12.2%), indicating that the country is urbanizing at a rapid pace. With an increasing number of people living in urban areas, the GHG emissions and environmental problems have also increased, owing to lacunae in urban planning and management. These GHG emissions ultimately contribute to climate change at both local and global levels. Therefore, measures to deal with climate change need to focus on both mitigation and adaptation. This study examines the status of a climate co-benefits approach in Indian cities, illustrated through various sectoral case studies. The study also attempts to examine how environmental issues in Indian cities align with local development issues. It discusses the context of climate and environmental co-benefits in urban India and relates it to urban policies. Implementation of the ACCCRN programme in three cities—Indore, Surat and Gorakhpur—is discussed to highlight climate change resilience issues at the local level and their environmental and social benefits. The final section deals with the future perspectives of integrating a climate co-benefits approach in urban development especially in light of the ‘100 Smart City Mission’ of India. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2018.

AB  - India’s overall exposure to climate-induced risks—such as cyclones, extreme rainfall, riverine floods, heat waves, and disease outbreaks—is causing large-scale damage to many states as well as unprecedented economic loss in cities. Since the late 2000s, the Government of India has been actively trying to incorporate climate change within the country’s development goals. Inclusion of the Climate Change Department within the Ministry of Environment and Forestry is one such initiative. This initiative has had some success in preserving biodiversity, but has contrastingly led to limited actions in cities, which function under the Ministry of Urban Development. In cities, most urban administrators have a short tenure ranging from 1 to 3 years, while political representative such as the Mayor has a maximum term of 4 years, thus making it difficult for them to deal with challenges that are probable 10–20 years in the future. Further, the magnitude of developmental challenges given rapid urban migration has led urban managers to address the immediate basic needs of citizens rather than plan for future eventualities, both in terms of climate change adaptation/mitigation and future population growth. The lack of inclusion within government programs, lack of incentives, increasing exposure, and spending for coping has created opportunities for individuals, communities, and institutions to design and implement resilience measures to address the problems of shocks and stresses that arise from climate extremes. This chapter highlights some of the wicked challenges faced by smart city initiatives in the context of climate change and offers innovative solutions to address them across scales and in time. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - This chapter provides an introductory primer for academic researchers and policy practitioners to understand and apply the policy mix perspective in developing transformative solutions for tackling global environmental challenges. By comparing and synthesising currently divergent understandings of policy mixes across different research disciplines, an extended framework is introduced to better incorporate different conceptual blocks - the policy mix element, associated policy processes, and resulting policy mix characteristics - in systematically investigating the role of policy mixes for addressing environmental challenges. Two standard approaches for delineating complex policy mixes - the top-down and the bottom-up approach - are discussed as a guideline for analysts interested in investigating real-world policy mixes. Taking global climate change as an illustrative example, the chapter then showcases the insights that can be generated by applying this extended policy mix perspective and how it thereby can inform real-world policy formulation, implementation, and evaluation activities. As a concluding remark, three promising research areas - transformative change, multi-level governance settings, and policy regime reconfigurations - are suggested to further advance our understanding of addressing real-world pressing environmental challenges through policy mixes. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Helge Jörgens, Christoph Knill, and Yves Steinebach; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Public green spaces (PGSs) have a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of urban residents. However, their accessibility can be limited due to high urbanisation pressures and inadequate or insufficient regulatory provisions. This problem has been recognised for Central European cities, of which Wrocław is an example, where the provision of PGS accessibility has not received major attention in recent decades, and the planning system has been in constant transformation since the transition from a centrally planned to a free-market economy. This study therefore aimed to examine the distribution and accessibility of PGSs in the expanding area of Wrocław today and upon implementation of the plans under the proposed standards. These analyses were performed using the QGIS application, network analysis, and the ISO-Area as polygon algorithm. The findings revealed a conspicuous lack of available PGSs, which includes areas above 2 ha, such as district and neighbourhood parks. New PGSs are now being planned, but even so, part of the residential areas will remain outside their catchment zone. The results obtained provide strong evidence that it is essential that standards should be a tool implemented in urban planning, and that the adopted procedure can be transferred to other cities. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Urban consumption patterns and lifestyles are increasingly important for the sustainability of cities today and in the future. However, considerations of consumption issues, social norms, behaviour and lifestyles within current urban sustainability research and practices are limited. Much untapped potential for the reduction of the environmental footprint of cities exists in combined production and consumption-based approaches, particularly in the “demand” areas of mobility, housing, food, and waste. To change unsustainable consumption and production patterns in cities, research needs to be transdisciplinary, actively involving stakeholders through co-creation processes. This paper builds on the premise that the perspectives and approaches of Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) for cities require the involvement of non-traditional stakeholders that are generally not included in urban planning processes such as social change initiatives, citizen groups and informal sector representatives. We present a transdisciplinary research and engagement framework to understand and advance the transition to sustainable SCP patterns and lifestyles in cities. This transdisciplinary approach to SCP transformations in cities combines co-creation, participatory visioning processes and back-casting methods, participatory urban governance and institutional change, and higher-order learning from small-scale community initiatives. We illustrate our conceptual framework through three empirical case studies in cities which take an integrative approach to lowering ecological footprints and carbon emissions. © 2018

AB  - There is now a large body of research into public understanding of climate change and energy challenges. There is however little empirical examination of how actors from politics, government, civil society and non-governmental organisations regard the role of public engagement in climate and energy policy. Research is lacking as to their views on the desirability of active citizen participation or indeed whether they draw on the findings from social science research in forming strategies and policy. This paper presents an analysis of interviews with policy experts and deliberative seminars held with non-governmental stakeholders acting in an intermediary capacity between climate policy and the public. A comparison of four policy scenarios was used to explore intermediaries’ beliefs about the role of the public in delivering the UK's Climate Change Act targets. The results reveal a general antipathy to policies that seek to ‘engage’ the public and a lack of knowledge amongst seminar participants about how insights from the social sciences can be used to build and sustain public engagement. This research exposes the need to assess the means by which public engagement can better be understood, integrated and most effectively utilised for sustainable progression towards climate targets. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid urbanization and climate change have intensified water-related challenges in urban areas, requiring innovative solutions for sustainable water management. This study critically examines China’s sponge city initiative, which integrates green infrastructure and ecological principles to enhance urban water resilience. The research identifies key challenges, including inadequate planning, design inconsistencies, and financial sustainability issues, which hinder the full realization of ecosystem service benefits. To address these gaps, we propose a novel ecological compensation framework that integrates the ecosystem services framework with urban planning and public payment mechanisms. Our four-step methodology leverages low impact development practices to enhance policy efficacy, aligning urban development with ecological integrity and sustainability. By transitioning from ecosystem service recognition to a publicly funded compensation model, this approach ensures the financial viability of sponge city projects, fosters broad societal participation, and supports resilient urban development. Importantly, the developed framework is adaptable, making it applicable to sponge city initiatives worldwide. It offers a flexible, evidence-based strategy for cities facing similar water management challenges, promoting ecological resilience while ensuring long-term financial sustainability. This study contributes to global urban water management discourse, providing a scalable model that supports integrated, community-backed urban planning and sets a new standard for sponge city development. © 2024 The Author(s).

In this framework, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of e-government and natural resources rents on financial and human development as proxies for sustainable development. The analysis conducted for the period 2008–2022 revealed the role of economic growth and e-government in supporting the sustainable development in the EU. However, natural resources rent negatively impacted human development and only coal rents enhanced financial development in the old EU member states. The results could support the new EU policies to achieve sustainable development by an efficient use of natural resources and by implementing digitalization for public services. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate change is projected to affect Latin America and the Caribbean as a result of increased temperatures and changed rainfall patterns. The impacts of climate change are expected to be unevenly distributed throughout the region, due to differences in geographic location, demographic pressures, levels of poverty, and natural resource dependence. To date, few studies have explored these impacts and the governmental responses to cope with them at a city scale. This article examines the challenges faced by the Mexico City government as it translates the federal climate change policy into successful mitigation and adaptation. It analyzes climate change impacts on Mexico and Mexico City (also known as the Federal District), the federal and city’s mitigation and adaptation responses, and advances and contradictions in the implementation of these strategies at the national and city levels. Similar problems have limited the effectiveness of these actions at both the federal and city levels, including the overexploitation of natural resources, a lack of climate information and monitoring systems, and the subordination of climate change strategies to the objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. These problems have resulted in poor coordination and collaboration among various levels of government to cope with climate change, in addition to avoiding local capacity building, particularly in regard to forest conservation. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Traditional urban containment strategies are being supplemented by a range of alternative spatial strategies and styles of governance. New Zealand has experimented with a performative approach to planning, replacing conventional land use zoning with an effects-based resource management paradigm. Consequences for peri-urban landscapes are investigated and implications for other developed countries seeking to reform their planning systems are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper examines community-initiated free(cycling) markets/workshops as emerging frontiers of a sharing and circular economy in Singapore. Research on sharing platforms have frequently underscored the significance of digital networks in catalysing temporary access to goods/services. As a departure from this, we shift our attention to sharing arenas involving the physical co-presence of actors and objects. Drawing on an ethnographic study of three case studies, we illustrate how free(cycling) markets entail not just the sharing of material resources but also more-than-material ones such as skills, knowledge, labour and time. These more-than-material resources are pivotal in sustaining sharing collectives, but have been glossed over in the literature. In particular, we coin the term ‘circular sharing’ to illuminate the overlaps in how sharing and circularity have been conceived. We contend that these ideas are complementary; ‘sharing’ highlights the socio-relational dimensions of closing resource circularity loops while ‘circularity’ gives weight to the recirculation of resources that sharing engenders. Additionally, we evaluate the pitfalls and potentials of circular sharing markets/workshops in Singapore, especially in terms of how they can help to realise a transformative sharing/circular society. Taken together, this paper is instructive in fostering a productive dialogue between the scholarship on circular and sharing economies. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Based on a survey of two Lesotho communities, this study assessed the type of governance of energy that favours the emergence of energy democracy or community energy. It established that the centralized energy governance of Semonkong seems less effective in solving conflicts compared to the decentralized energy governance of Ha-Makebe. Poor communication and lack of will to respond to community needs caused dissatisfaction and misunderstanding towards the centralized energy project. The study found that the decentralized energy project was more likely to be sustainable because it was characterized by community participation and engagement. The findings also revealed that the satisfaction of energy consumers results from a consistent supply of energy accompanied by responsiveness to community needs as opposed to a cheap inconsistent electricity supply. The implications are that the Semonkong plant’s sustainability is at risk, and the project may collapse unless the Government of Lesotho, in the short term, engages with the community regarding its concerns. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to clarify the relationship between sustainability-oriented innovations (SOI) and smart city development based on the systematic review of existing literature in the field. As an outcome of the review process, 159 articles were carefully selected for the in-depth analysis of the inter-linked concepts of smart city and sustainability-oriented innovations. The results show a growing trend of research papers in this field, especially in the last five years. The findings show the significance of a systemic multi-dimensional view of innovations for the smart sustainable development of cities. We have identified four main perspectives through which the scholars discourse the SOI dimensions in the smart city context: technology perspective, organizational perspective, social innovation perspective with citizen engagement, as well as system-level changes with innovation ecosystems. Second, we have recognized various focused themes under each main perspective. The various types of innovations also have impacts on different components of smart cities. Although the technological innovation perspectives dominate, and governance aspects are also paid attention to in recent studies, the increasing amount of research outputs also report on the developments of other components and perspectives, such as new human-centric approaches like citizen engagement. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - This paper provides a general understanding of the various approaches to city sustainability and weather and how the current approaches are useful to deal with climate change. A working definition of sustainability is provided, then various approaches to sustainability are reviewed, and a process based approach is proposed for assessing infrastructures sustainability. Sustainability is continuous improvement in the following three domains: minimization and optimization of resource consumption, fundamental health and well being of people, and innovating and perusing ways to manage change. The current approaches to sustainability: ranking, indicators, urban footprint, metabolism and extended metabolism are reviewed, as well as the combination of footprint and indicators in city sustainability assessment. In addition, the application of mathematical models in sustainability is also discussed. Based on the review and analysis it was found that current models for city sustainability do not consider human health and climate change explicitly into the decision making. Moreover, all the approaches to date are parameter based and a process based approach to infrastructure sustainability is necessary. The proposed Process, Resource, People and Change (PRPC) approach to sustainability will enable cities to factor resource usage reduction, climate change adaptation and people's health and well being in the infrastructure related decision making.

AB  - It is commonly assumed by the projects demonstrating concepts for positive energy districts in cities across Europe that citizens want and need to be involved in the development of these concepts as an essential condition for positive energy districts to be deployed successfully and to achieve the expected societal goals. Six different research and innovation projects are investigating the different forms of energy citizenship in positive energy districts and their impacts. They aim to apply a transdisciplinary approach to collaborative research and to impact assessment. The interim results are described, and preliminary conclusions on impact are drawn. The projects each used different approaches to engaging citizens, while differentiating between different groups. Progress is monitored but only fragmentary evidence on the impact has been gathered. Transdisciplinary approaches are being developed but are still immature. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Purpose: The chapter analyses the diversity of the European Union (EU) member states in terms of the transition to a sustainable, green, and just economy.Need for the study: Sustainable development is an important concern that the EU approaches by aiming to transition to a greener economy, fairly and inclusively. Moreover, the actual context, post-pandemic period and ongoing war at the EU border, makes the social and economic development of the EU countries matter even more in the light of this just transition. Methodology: The authors relied on a multidimensional approach, using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The cluster analysis allowed us to group the countries in such a way that made it possible to identify the best and worst performers, as well as certain patterns that can be the basis for the formulation of good practices and transferable to the states that need more support in the transition to a green economy.Findings: The results indicated that EU member states can be grouped into five clusters, each needing specific policies to ensure sustainable and inclusive development. Denmark, Finland, and Sweden turned out the best performers, while Estonia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, and Romania proved to have the most unfavourable situation.Practical implications: The findings provide relevant policy implication insights for policy decision-makers in the field of green economy, economic development, and social policies, with directions for future research. © 2024 by Maria Denisa Vasilescu, Mădălina Ecaterina Popescu, Larisa Stănilă and Eva Militaru Published under exclusive licence by Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Private sector collaboration for sustainable development remains a “black box” in terms of collaborative governance mechanisms: the specific arrangements or types of collaboration used by multiple actors to come together and implement and oversee rules to align their efforts towards shared goals. Therefore, a theoretical framework is needed to guide the design of collaborative efforts towards the achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) . We address such a need, using a systematic literature review to conceptualize the main dimensions of collaborative governance (hierarchy, formalization, centralization), and the factors influencing the impact of collaborative governance choice on sustainable development outcomes. Our results highlight that there are different types of collaboration as a governance mechanism for progress towards Sustainable Development Goals and that alternative governance arrangements should be combined. We also found that the success of collaboration is contingent not only on governance-specific dimensions but also on the type of SDG and the type of partners involved. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objectives: This article is aimed at a cross-spectrum analysis of satisfaction with the quality of life in the high school students of Ishim town (Tyumen region, Russia), and the actual environmental issues. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Phyto-indication and zoo-indication methods adapted in article to study the water quality in economically significant reservoirs of Ishim. Representatives of various trophic levels were used as bioindication objects: aquatic macrophytes and bony fish: golden carp, roach, ruff. Sociological survey covered 709 senior high school students of Ishim town. The questionnaire included the indicators of the measured quality of life by 10 conditional spheres of social life. Findings: According to the results of a sociological survey, an integral evaluation of the quality of children's life in of Ishim town corresponds to an average level. The most vulnerable spheres of children's life in the small city of Ishim are environment and ecology, inclusion of disabled children and safe traffic. The participants of the city marked the lack of green zones in the city suitable and available for children to use them (0,88), they valued ecological conditions as an average one (2,0), gave a low integral evaluation of the state of environment - 1,46. The results of phyto-indication and zoo-indication researches showed the low quality of the surface natural water of the water basins having been researched. An empirical evaluation of the quality of natural environment by high school students generally corresponds to existing ecological risks resulted from the low quality of water in economically significant water basins of the Tyumen Region. Application/Improvements: The research indicates the need to optimize the state of natural objects in Ishim and the need to improve the management process for urban area content and development of public environmental culture.

AB  - The development of green spaces in cities has corresponded to a need to deal with a series of socio-environmental and health problems felt in urban spaces. However, these are often fragmented or somewhat disconnected interventions that leave out vulnerable and subaltern groups like children, being also commonly based on strictly formatted designs, with more urban furniture than natural elements. In view of the need to make urban spaces healthier, safer, more resilient, and at the same time more child-friendly, in this Conceptual Analysis paper we build from the literature on Urban Green Spaces, Child-Friendly Cities and environments, and Children's Infrastructure to propose the concept of Children Green Infrastructure (CGI), and discuss its application to urban planning, foregrounding the need for fairer, more inclusive and participatory approaches. GGI derives from the Children Infrastructure concept but it puts at the center of the debate the idea of connecting children to nature where they live, learn and play. CGI is based on the assumption that nature should be transversal in urban planning processes, and that it must be perfectly integrated within urban infrastructures, ensuring access to all. Understanding children's needs and integrating their voices in urban planning and design processes are necessary conditions to moving forward to a fairer, more inclusive and truly collective urban project.

AB  - "Sprawl" is one of the ugliest words in the American political lexicon. Virtually no one wants America's rural landscapes, farmland, and natural areas to be lost to bland, placeless malls, freeways, and subdivisions. Yet few of America's fast-growing rural areas have effective rules to limit or contain sprawl. Oregon is one of the nation's most celebrated exceptions. In the early 1970s Oregon established the nation's first and only comprehensive statewide system of land-use planning and largely succeeded in confining residential and commercial growth to urban areas while preserving the state's rural farmland, forests, and natural areas. Despite repeated political attacks, the state's planning system remained essentially politically unscathed for three decades. In the early- and mid-2000s, however, the Oregon public appeared disenchanted, voting repeatedly in favor of statewide ballot initiatives that undermined the ability of the state to regulate growth. One of America's most celebrated "success stories" in the war against sprawl appeared to crumble, inspiring property rights activists in numerous other western states to launch copycat ballot initiatives against land-use regulation. This is the first book to tell the story of Oregon's unique land-use planning system from its rise in the early 1970s to its near-death experience in the first decade of the 2000s. Using participant observation and extensive original interviews with key figures on both sides of the state's land use wars past and present, this book examines the question of how and why a planning system that was once the nation's most visible and successful example of a comprehensive regulatory approach to preventing runaway sprawl nearly collapsed. Planning Paradise is tough love for Oregon planning. While admiring much of what the state's planning system has accomplished, Walker and Hurley believe that scholars, professionals, activists, and citizens engaged in the battle against sprawl would be well advised to think long and deeply about the lessons that the recent struggles of one of America's most celebrated planning systems may hold for the future of land-use planning in Oregon and beyond. © 2011 by The University of Arizona Press All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban pollution governance requires the joint participation of government, society, and enterprises, with the environmental information disclosure policy serving as a novel tool to promote multi-stakeholder engagement. This study aims to delve into the impact of the environmental information disclosure policy on regional environmental quality by using data from Chinese cities. Through analysis, the study gets the following conclusions. Firstly, the environmental information disclosure policy not only effectively reduces urban environmental pollution but also exhibits an apparent spatial spillover effect. The impact of this policy on air pollution in neighboring cities shows an inverted U-shaped pattern of first rising and then falling, with the optimal radius of this external effect estimated at 250 km. Secondly, the results of the mechanism test indicate that government regulatory efforts and clean industry alternatives are essential channels for curbing urban environmental pollution. Lastly, the heterogeneity test shows that the inhibitory effect of the environmental information disclosure policy on environmental pollution is more pronounced in civilized cities, cities in the “two control zones”, sulfur dioxide control zones, and cities with high Pollution Information Transparency Index scores. © 2024 The Economic Society of Australia (Queensland) Inc.

AB  - Wang employs Foucault’s governmentality framework to problematize the making of an urban ecotopia in China, using the International Low-Carbon City in Shenzhen as a case study. Following earlier scholars writing about eco-governmentality, Wang tries to interrogate three questions. Firstly, what are the underlying mentalities that underpin and condition the growing eco-city movement in China in the past decade? Secondly, how to characterize the specific visions of eco-ness and sustainable development that are promoted in current discourses and practices of eco-city building in China? And if there is a gap between rhetoric and reality, how to account for it? Thirdly, how to understand the power dynamics embodied in the discourses and practices of eco-cities in China?. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In 2015, China initiated the Sponge City Program (SCP), an integrated urban stormwater management strategy, to mitigate the paradoxical challenges of urban flooding and water shortages. Very few studies have attempted to examine the willingness to participate of multi-level stakeholders in the case of storm-water management initiatives. To address this gap in the existing body of knowledge, this study took Guyuan city, Ningxia Province, a Stage 2 pilot city located in the arid northwest region of the People's Republic of China, as a case study. Members of three key stakeholder groups were surveyed, i.e., government, commercial entities and communities, and a total of 687 valid questionnaires were obtained in the SCP. Via a logistic regression model, the results showed that: (1) the stakeholders reached a consensus during the participation process that they were motivated by personal benefits and expected to improve water usage through the participatory process; (2) the government represented the public interest by prioritizing the overall improvement of the urban water environment and improving standards of living by contributing to the program; (3) the commercial entities prioritized the acquisition of knowledge and technical issues relevant to their business operations, and expressed concerns about how these operations might be affected by stakeholder participation; (4) both the commercial and community groups were more willing to participate if they perceived that the SCP would affect their daily lives, and the general public were willing to participate for multiple reasons. This study will help to guide future studies to continuously explore the diverse factors that influence the stakeholder participation of diverse stakeholders. The findings can also benefit the design of future projects with a view to enhancing stakeholder participation. Recognizing the quantifiable benefits of the SCP, this paper demonstrates how the evaluation of diverse stakeholders' priorities and the assessment of the drivers for their willingness to participate can further benefit the implementation of sustainable urban water initiatives, as in the case of this megaproject, and their enduring success. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The contradiction between resource depletion and economic growth in resource-exhausted cities is becoming prominent. The role of ICT has been reflected in many policies to promote sustainable urban development. It is necessary to clarify the mechanism of ICT for urban green transformation efficiency (UGTE) in resource-exhausted cities. In this research, 39 resource-exhausted cities in China were selected as the research samples, and panel data were collected for 20 years to assess their ICT development level and their UGTE. The panel regression model, PVAR model, heterogeneity test, and moderating effect test were used to analyze the relationship between the two. The main findings are as follows: (1) ICT has a facilitating effect on UGTE in resource-exhausted cities, with a regression coefficient of 0.170⁎⁎⁎. (2) The improvement of ICT significantly promotes the UGTE in these cities, and the promotional effect reaches a peak after a lag of 6 periods; the original UGTE also has a negative impact on the future ICT development level, and the negative impact reaches a peak after a lag of 6 periods. (3) The promotional effect of ICT on UGTE in resource-exhausted cities consists of being strongest in the eastern region (0.477⁎⁎⁎), then in the central region (0.233⁎⁎⁎), weaker in the western region (0.167⁎⁎), and weakest in the northeastern region (0.080*). (4) The improvement of energy structure, green innovation structure, and urban-rural consumption structure strengthens the promotional effect of ICT on UGTE in resource-exhausted cities. Finally, targeted policy recommendations were proposed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: New urbanization is a powerful support for regional economic growth and green transformation. Methods: In this paper, we select data from 237 cities at prefecture level and above in China from 2010 to 2021 for quasi-experimental design, and investigate the effects of new urbanization policy pilots on urban green total factor productivity (GTFP) and its mechanism by constructing a multi-period difference-in-differences model. Results: The study finds that: a) the construction of new urbanization has a positive impact on promoting urban GTFP, and this result is verified by a series of robustness tests; b) the promotion of industrial structure upgrading, the facilitation of green technological innovation, and the reduction of the degree of resource mismatch all partially mediate the relationship between new urbanization and urban GTFP; c) environmental regulation and market integration both modulate the relationship between the construction of new urbanization and urban GTFP in positive directions; d) heterogeneity analysis shows that, in terms of the two-dimensional city attributes of ‘location-characteristics’, the increase in GTFP is more significant in eastern and central cities, and in non-resource cities; e) further analysis shows that the pilot policies of new urbanization have a spatial spillover effect on GTFP, and the policy spillover effects are mainly affected through mechanisms such as industrial structure upgrading in neighboring municipalities. Discussion: This study provides new ideas for the next stage of sustainable regional green development in China, thus promoting China's high-quality development with theoretical and practical significance.

AB  - The escalation of ground-level ozone (O3) pollution presents a significant challenge to the sustainable growth of Chinese cities. This study utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to investigate the intricate interplay between urban socioeconomic growth and O3 levels. Surpassing traditional environmental chemistry, it assesses the effectiveness of these algorithms in interpreting socioeconomic and environmental data, while elucidating urban development’s environmental impacts from a novel socioeconomic perspective. Key findings indicate that factors such as urban infrastructure, industrial activities, and demographic dynamics significantly influence O3 pollution. The study highlights the particular sensitivity of urban public transportation and population density, each exerting a unique and substantial effect on O3 levels. Additionally, the research identifies nuanced interactions among these factors, indicating a complex web of influences on urban O3 pollution. These interactions suggest that the impact of individual socioeconomic elements on O3 pollution is interdependent, being either amplified or mitigated by other factors. The study emphasizes the crucial need to integrate socioeconomic variables into urban O3 pollution strategies, advocating for policies tailored to each city’s distinct characteristics, informed by the detailed analysis provided by machine learning. This approach is essential for developing effective and nuanced urban pollution management strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - In the context of rising energy demand, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity in G7 countries, the prime objective of this research is to explore the role of green innovation technologies, economic progress, and urbanization in energy demand. The long-standing relationship between green innovation technologies, urbanization, trade, and G7 countries from 1990 to 2020 was analyzed using the Kao and Pedroni cointegration test, panel causality, and dynamic and fully modified ordinary least squares methods. Empirical findings suggest that trade, gross domestic product per capita, and urbanization enhance energy demand, whereas environmental technology reduces energy consumption. The econometric results support promoting environmental technologies (“smart technology,” renewable energy, carbon dioxide removal, and electric vehicles) as policy tools to reduce energy demand and achieve sustainable development goals related to clean energy, a pollution-free climate, and green growth. Moreover, an energy conservation policy is recommended to ensure efficient energy use in G7 countries. In addition, novel implications in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-7, 13) are discussed. © 2023 International Association for Gondwana Research

AB  - The new energy demonstration city policy (NEDC), an essential economic system aiming to implement innovative development strategies and energy structure transformations in China, is crucial for solving the current plight of resource-based cities. This paper studies the effect of the implementation of the NEDC on the green total factor productivity (GTFP) of resource-based cities in China; understanding this relation is of great significance for the further promotion of the NEDC. For this purpose, the SBM-undesirable model is employed to measure GTFP. The propensity score matching and difference-in-difference (PSM-DID) model and the mediation effect model are also utilized to empirically examine the impact of the NEDC on GTFP across a dataset of 106 resource-based cities between 2005 and 2016. The empirical results indicate that the NEDC can significantly improve the GTFP of resource-based cities. After both counterfactual and common trend tests are performed, the research conclusion of this paper is still robust. Moreover, the NEDC promotes the GTFP of resource-based cities through structural effects, technological innovation effects, and fiscal support effects. Furthermore, the effect of the NEDC on GTFP is also affected by the regions, sizes, and types of the different resource-based cities. This research provides evidence for the ability of the NEDC to improve GTFP and optimize the spatial layout of new energy demonstration cities in resource-based cities. © 2021 Newcastle University.

AB  - Conducting Marine Ecological Civilization Construction (MECC) will help to form the coordination of socio-economic, marine ecosystem, and stable marine society. How to evaluate the performance of MECC precisely is an urgent problem in the development of coastal areas. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation indices system consisting of 41 indicators and five dimensions was constructed to reflect the performance of MECC in three coastal cities of Jiangsu Province. Entropy and AHP methods were integrally used to determine the weight of each index, and then, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method was applied to depict the relative performance level of marine ecological civilization. The results showed that: (1) From 2011 to 2021, the MECC of Jiangsu coastal regions has gradually increased from 0.3649 to 0.5933, indicating that the development of Jiangsu is undergoing a transformation from resource intensive to environmentally friendly. (2) Different cities had different strengths in marine subsystem layer, with Lianyungang dominated by resource endowment, Yancheng capitalizing on its environmental strengths, and Nantong being significant in marine economic. (3) A decade long dynamic showed that Yancheng achieved the largest improvement by 84.82% from 2011 to 2021, followed by Nantong (69.48%) and Lianyungang (38.15%). (4) For further promoting MECC process, Jiangsu should strategically prioritize land-sea coordination, undertake comprehensive governance and waging a resolute battle for comprehensive marine governance in critical areas. The comprehensive performance evaluation indices system of MECC proposed in this study would be robust and reliable for application in other areas. Meanwhile, the results and recommendations of Jiangsu Province could be valuable for further enhancing MECC development and providing scientific bases for local decision-makers. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid urbanization and population increase, along with remarkable technological advances, have accelerated the speed of digital transformation, or at least the need for it, in our cities. Whilst being smart and sustainable is seen somewhat as an ideal city quality globally, a new city concept has emerged—the so-called City 4.0—that combines Industry 4.0 and Society 4.0 in the context of smart cities. While there is growing literature on the topic, there is limited understanding of City 4.0. This communication piece aims to bring clarity to City 4.0 by elaborating it from three diverse but interrelated perspectives—namely, societal, environmental, and economic lenses or domains (also know as the triple bottom line approach)—and highlights the key City 4.0 themes—namely, circularity, adaptability, livability, accessibility, authenticity, and responsibility. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current City 4.0 literature. This communication paper informs researchers, local and regional authorities, and urban planners on the rising importance of the notion of City 4.0 and its prospective research areas. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In the context of China's rapid urbanization and pressing environmental challenges, this study evaluates the effectiveness of the New Energy Demonstration Cities initiative in fostering sustainable urban development. Employing a quasi-experimental design, the study specifically analyzed the impact of this initiative on urban green development, quantified through the metric of Green Total Factor Productivity (GTFP). The findings reveal significant improvements in GTFP, indicating enhanced air pollution control and energy use efficiency through targeted government intervention and industrial upgrading, moderated by financial development. These results not only challenge the efficacy of broad, non-specific policies but also underscore the importance of precision in policy targeting. The study highlights how well-crafted, localized energy policies can drive substantial gains in sustainable urban growth, offering crucial insights for global policymakers and urban planners. This research extends the discourse on policy effectiveness in environmental management, suggesting pivotal areas for future investigation. © 2024

AB  - In the past two decades, great efforts have been made to develop sustainability solutions for the built environment. One way to measure the efficacy of such solutions is by using sustainability indicators. Greater use of underground space is one of the proposed solutions. However, a detailed review of the current construction sector sustainability indicator systems, such as the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method and Civil Engineering Environmental Quality Assessment and Awards Scheme, shows that there is a need for a bespoke sustainability indicator framework system tailored to urban underground space. The aim of this paper is to extend previous discussions about the role of underground space in urban areas, with the intention of addressing this shortfall. A new framework is proposed, called Uspear, developed on the basis of the Sustainable Project Appraisal Routine framework revised and restructured specifically for application on urban underground space projects. By the use of an innovative weighting system adopted through extensive stakeholder engagement, the new framework represents a comprehensive indicator framework for addressing sustainability in underground urban space projects. © 2018 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.

AB  - Incorporating the internationally recognized Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into national strategies is essential for achieving these goals within the specified timelines. To this end, China is advancing the construction of ecological civilization, aiming to promote economic growth while safeguarding the environment. This study seeks to establish a connection between the SDGs and China's efforts in Ecological Civilization Construction (ECC) by developing a set of practical performance evaluation indicators consistent with the global SDG framework. The research employs various methods, including entropy weighting, coupling coordination models, the Dagum Gini coefficient, and Kernel density estimation, to assess SDGs indicators based ECC performance in China from 2011 to 2022. It explores the spatiotemporal variations in ECC performance across different regions and provinces, evaluates the coupling and coordination between subsystems, examines regional disparities, and investigates the dynamic evolution of these disparities. The results show that: (1) overall, ECC performance in China has been on the rise, with the eastern region performing notably better than other regions; (2) the coupling coordination among subsystems is still in its early stages, indicating considerable progress is required to reach a higher level of ecological civilization; (3) although there are disparities in ECC performance, they are not severe and are mainly due to inter-regional differences; (4) absolute disparities in ECC performance between regions and provinces are gradually diminishing. These findings are crucial for China to enhance its ecological civilization comprehensively, promote sustainable development, and achieve the SDGs within the designated time frame. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - In China, how to guide residents on actively participating in decision-making activities related to urban settlement regeneration is critical and must be addressed. Referring to the theory of planned behavior (TPB), combined with the characteristics of regeneration decision-making, the external environmental factors affecting residents’ participation in such decision-making activities, through impacting psychological environmental factors, were determined by establishing the structural equation model (SEM) and conducting a survey. The guidance measures of enhancing external pressure and providing regeneration information were selected. Participation guidance experiments were designed, and the typical communities located in the development zone and city center of Harbin, China were selected as the experiment regions. Forty-eight subjects were screened in each experimental region and divided into six groups; three participated in the experiments regarding the leading role of representatives, enhancing communication, and incentives, and three in the experiments on policy advocacy, regeneration technology popularization, and regeneration case sharing. Guidance measures’ effects for introversion or extraversion, regardless of region are, from large to small, incentives, regeneration case sharing, leading role of representatives, enhancing communication, policy advocacy and regeneration technology popularization. There are significant differences in the effects of enhancing external pressure measures between different personalities, and enhancing external pressure measures are more effective for extraversion. Although the differences in the effects of providing regeneration information measures are statistically insignificant, providing such measures is more effective for introversion. The results reflect the analysis of the influencing factors. TPB application is enriched and the guidance experiments used to verify guiding measures’ effectiveness are provided. Practically-significant implications include: communities and proprietor committees should organize neighborhood-relationship to enhance community activities, with the proprietor committee solving residents’ daily problems to win authority and trust, positively guiding residents’ participation. Community staff can also understand, via daily participation, residents’ personality traits, so as to implement the above-mentioned guidance measures. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Spatial planning is broadly acknowledged for its pivotal role in local climate change adaptation. Nevertheless, variations persist among countries in their perceptions and practices concerning the effectiveness and feasibility of utilizing spatial planning for climate change adaptation. Chinese cities confront the challenges of global warming, rapid urbanization, and intensified extreme weather events. Climate change adaptation agreements, frameworks, and policies have predominantly emphasized the national scale, often overlooking local adaptation efforts. However, the ongoing reform and restructuring of China’s territorial and spatial planning system encompasses the categorization, hierarchical management, control of comprehensive national land resource development, and conservation. This process is gradually establishing spatial planning strategies that synergize with the impacts of climate change, thereby offering an opportunity to integrate climate change adaptation objectives into spatial planning. This endeavor is supported by a series of regulatory standards and guidelines to ensure its effective implementation. The study scrutinizes the public draft of territorial and spatial master plans for 368 Chinese cities to assess the integration of climate change concerns at the local level and to identify disparities among cities. Employing the Awareness, Analysis, and Action Framework (3A Framework), which draws from prior scholarship and integrates relevant existing research, we identified and assessed 30 criteria for recognizing and appraising climate change adaptation strategies in territorial and spatial planning. The study’s findings indicate that: (1) The role of territorial and spatial planning in integrating climate change issues at the city level requires enhancement, as reflected in the generally low “awareness” of climate change concerns, limited “analytical capacity” regarding climate change, and a certain foundation for “action response” to climate change adaptation; (2) Large cities, characterized by robust economies and population concentrations, generally outperform small and medium-sized cities. They exhibit a superior ability to delineate quantifiable climate adaptation indicators and measures. In conclusion, the study provides prospective recommendations concerning technical approaches, spatial governance, mechanisms, and actions to more effectively incorporate climate change adaptation objectives into local-level territorial and spatial planning. © 2023 by the authors.
