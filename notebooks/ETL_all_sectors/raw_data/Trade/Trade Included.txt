AB  - Multiple knowledge systems are crucial to understand human-environment interactions of the biodiversity of agriculture and food systems (agrobiodiversity). This article synthesizes these knowledge systems to formulate the novel Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework comprised of four themes: (1) ecology and evolution; (2) governance; (3) food, nutrition, and health; and (4) global environmental and socioeconomic changes. Resulting characterization of these knowledge themes, joined with cross-theme integration, demonstrate advances of agrobiodiversity research, management, and policy amid the accelerated global environmental and socioeconomic transformations of the Anthropocene. Framework results guide the presentation of new data from the Agrobiodiversity, Food, and Nutrition project (AFN) in Peru. These results integrate an emphasis on factors of global change, including climate change. The combination of the new knowledge framework and project results is utilized to point toward future directions for research, policy, and management. The Agrobiodiversity Knowledge Framework is essential to address the transformative planetary challenges of the Anthropocene that include sustainable development with nutritional security, biodiversity conservation, social justice, climate change, and nutrient pollution. Strengthening the focus on and analysis of the complex human-environment interactions of biodiversity in agriculture and food is vital as a nexus of science, scholarship, management, and policy in the era of Earth systems dominated by human activity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research's problem statement centers on balancing economic development with environmental protection and social well-being. As mineral resources represent a crucial driver of economic growth in these regions, examining how their exploitation impacts economic indicators and the broader dimensions of sustainability and equity is imperative. Over the past decade (2010–2020), the role of mineral-based industrialization in fostering economic growth has garnered significant attention, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This study delves into the complex interplay between mineral-based industrialization, environmental sustainability, and social equity in these regions, employing the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model as a critical analytical tool. The results of this study reveal multifaceted insights. While mineral-based industrialization has indeed contributed to economic growth in these regions, the environmental implications are significant. Often, the extraction and processing of minerals come at the cost of environmental degradation, posing challenges to sustainability. Moreover, the distribution of benefits from this growth is often unequal, exacerbating social inequities. This research underscores the complex dynamics surrounding mineral-based industrialization in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It highlights the need for a nuanced approach considering economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social equity. Policymakers and stakeholders must carefully navigate these challenges to ensure that mineral resources serve as catalysts for comprehensive and inclusive development in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Since subsidies for fossil-fuel producers entail “carbon locked-in” risks, phasing out the subsidies is widely agreed to be critical for progress on climate change towards carbon neutrality. However, due to the uncertainties and irreversibilities associated with environmental degradation and economic losses, delaying removal efforts allows us to benefit from cheaper abatement options and less total abatements owning to self-regeneration of pollution stock. Therefore, whether the removal action should be taken currently or be delayed becomes vital for policy making. We develop a real option model of policy timing using a green social welfare as the objective, consisting of the standard Hotelling model of exhaustible resource extraction, and a stochastic state variable to capture uncertainties over the social costs of environmental damage. Analytic solutions are derived to show the implication of these uncertainties for policy adoption, and the results are presented: (i) a higher volatility of economic costs per emissions leads to a positive incentive for delaying removal in some bounds of uncertainties; (ii) amount of subsidies, pollution stocks, depletion of fossil fuel production and its marginal costs have negative impacts on the timing threshold, which implies that adopting currently is better than waiting; and (iii) discount rate increases the option value of delaying the policy. Our study provides a valuable framework to determine the energy and environmental policy timing with uncertainties for regulators. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - With the ongoing global climate change and energy structure transformation, green energy efficiency has become one of the key indicators for achieving sustainable development. This study uses panel data from 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province, China, from 2012 to 2022 to explore the spatiotemporal evolution and driving factors of green energy efficiency. The study employs the super-efficiency Slack-Based Measure (SBM) method to measure the green energy efficiency of each region. It uses the Gini coefficient and kernel density estimation methods to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of green energy efficiency. Furthermore, based on a fixed effects model, the study delves into the main driving factors influencing green energy efficiency. The results show that green energy efficiency in Jiangsu Province is generally on an upward trend. The Gini coefficients of both the southern and northern regions of Jiangsu have increased, but the gap in green energy efficiency between the two regions has gradually widened. The degree of government intervention and the level of industrialization are unfavorable to the growth of green energy efficiency. In contrast, foreign investment levels, financial development, and urbanization show significant positive effects. Finally, based on the empirical findings, targeted recommendations are provided to promote green energy efficiency, offering important theoretical support and empirical evidence for the country’s strategic goals of achieving green and low-carbon development.

AB  - With the deterioration of the greenhouse effect, countries around the world have introduced all kinds of carbon emission reduction policies to cope with the challenge of global climate change. In this background, the development of fresh produce supply chain in China has also encountered new challenges, and there is a large amount of carbon emissions in each link from production to transport to final sales of agricultural products, so the study of fresh produce supply chain decision-making problems considering carbon emissions is conducive to promoting its low-carbon and efficient operation. This paper introduces the policy of government subsidy for unit products, uses the conflict analysis method based on graph model to determine the object of government subsidy, constructs a three-stage game model under these two mandatory policies respectively, solves and numerically analyses the problem, and finally makes suggestions for the low-carbon and fresh produce decision-making of the enterprises as well as the government’s formulation of relevant policies. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Carbon trading is considered a strategy for reallocating carbon permits and reducing abatement costs that may also change energy consumption and the distribution of atmospheric pollution emissions, resulting in environmental health benefits or damage on a regional scale. In this research, we use an agent-based model to construct a national carbon emissions trading market of the power sector based on the year of 2013, and simulate the key atmospheric pollution emission patterns and the corresponding environmental health effects. We find that compared with a command and control policy, the carbon trading policy is able to reduce the CO2 emissions and save abatement costs by approximately 63.53 RMB/ton. Meanwhile, the results show the carbon trading policy would synergistically reduce PM2.5 emissions by 1.55 million tons. Addition, we use a simplified exposure-response model to estimate health benefits by synergistically reducing PM2.5 emissions, and find that the carbon trading policy would decrease 45,200 cases of all-cause mortality and generate 307.07 billion RMB in environmental health benefits. The co-benefit accounts for 0.52% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013. However, compared with the command and control policy, carbon trading changes the pollution emission distribution among the different provinces, and results in unintended environmental health damages in some provinces. Setting reasonable trading directions and exchange ratios, increasing stringency of environmental regulations in some provinces with worsening air pollution should be implemented to complement the carbon trading policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Logistics operations are considered essential for transporting commodities from one location to another, helping to promote global economic activity. On the other hand, its negative impact eclipses its positive impact, namely the rise in healthcare expenditures due to its ecological footprint. Globally, rising out-of-pocket health expenses result from logistic-induced carbon emissions, posing a danger to the long-term viability of healthcare. Methods: Based on this critical fact, this study examined the impact of logistics operations on healthcare costs by controlling for carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic development across a large cross-section of 131 nations by using the Robust Least Squares Regression. Results: The findings demonstrate a U-shaped association between logistical operations and healthcare expenditures, i.e., if there is a 1% increase in logistics operations, healthcare expenditures decrease by −2.421% initially, while at later stages, healthcare costs would increase by 0.139%. On the other hand, increased fuel imports and economic growth due to logistics activities are increasing healthcare expenditures with an elasticity estimate of 0.087% and 0.147%, respectively. According to the forecasting predictions, logistics-induced carbon emissions, fuel imports, and economic expansion will increase healthcare expenses. Conclusions: A sustainable logistics operation is critical for strengthening healthcare infrastructure and meeting the global carbon neutrality goal. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Subsidies for fossil fuels are one of the major financial barriers to the shift to renewable energy in the world. A sustainable and safe world is based on renewable energy, which is derived from natural resources that are abundant and continuously replenished. This study investigates the impact of natural resources on renewable energy consumption in N-11 countries. It moderates the roles of economic growth, stock market capitalization, and technology from 1990 to 2020. This study involves the development of an empirical analysis, the application of advanced econometric methodologies, and the development of a comprehensive policy report. Technology and the stock market are negatively related to renewable energy consumption in the short and long run. There is a positive relationship between natural resources and renewable energy consumption both in the short and long term. A positive relationship exists between economic growth and renewable energy consumption over the long term. Energy policies must be clear, robust, transparent, supported by public support, and backed up by modern energy transmission systems implanted in N-11 countries to accelerate wind and solar energy adoption. In addition to reducing emissions, shifting subsidies to renewable energy supports sustainable economic growth, job creation, improved public health, and greater equity is recommended.

AB  - Identifying cropping systems with small global warming potential (GWP) per unit of productivity is important to ensure food security while minimizing environmental footprint. During recent decades, double-season rice (DR) systems in central China have progressively shifted into single-crop, middle-season rice (MR) due to high costs and labor requirements of double-season rice. Ratoon rice (RR) has been proposed as an alternative system that reconciliates both high annual productivity and relatively low costs and labor requirements. Here we used on-farm data collected from 240 farmer fields planted with rice in 2016 to evaluate annual energy balance, environmental impact, and net profit of MR, DR, and RR cropping systems in central China. Energy factors, emission values, and commodity prices obtained from literature and official statistics were used to estimate energy balance, GWP, and economic profit. Average annual yield was 7.7, 15.3. and 13.2 Mg ha −1 for MR, DR, and RR systems, respectively. Average total annual energy input (36 GJ ha −1 ), GWP (9783 kg ha −1 ), and production cost (3057 $ ha −1 ) of RR were 35–48% higher than those of MR. However, RR achieved 72–129% higher annual grain yield (13.2 Mg ha −1 ), net energy yield (159 GJ ha −1 ), and net economic return (2330 $ ha −1 ) than MR. Compared with DR, RR produced statistically similar net energy yield while doubling the net economic return, with 32–42% lower energy input, production costs, and GWP. Consequently, RR exhibited significantly higher net energy ratio and benefit-to-cost ratio, and substantially lower yield-scaled GWP than the other two cropping systems. In the context of DR being replaced by MR, our analysis indicated that RR can be a viable option to achieve both high annual productivity and large positive energy balance and profit, while reducing the environmental impact. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The change of digital technology has ushered in a new era of digital infrastructure (DI) development. Facilitating the synergistic of DI and inclusive green growth (IGG) is essential for achieving sustainable development at the regional level. This study draws on panel data from 107 cities within China's Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) and employs a variety of research methodologies, including the entropy method, the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM), exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), the Dagum Gini coefficient, the GM (1.1), and an optimal parameters-based geographical detector (OPGD). The aim is to explore the coupling coordination degree (CCD) and drivers between DI and IGG from 2011 to 2020. The findings reveal: (1) Throughout the study, the CCD within the YREB remained generally low, achieving only low coordination by 2020. However, the system demonstrates greater harmonization and improved quality each year. Spatially, the distribution pattern exhibits a distinct “high in the east and low in the west” trend. (2) The CCD exhibits a positive spatial correlation, particularly with High-High clusters concentrated in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). (3) Utilizing difference analysis and gray model predictions, the CCD level of the YREB shows considerable potential for development, with regional disparities gradually narrowing. (4) While the dominant driving factors of CCD vary across different sub-regions of the YREB, information supportability and economic driving force generally emerge as the primary drivers across different spatial sub-regions, with their impact significantly enhanced when interacting with other factors. Consequently, this study accurately identifies the driving factors in different spatial sub-divisions and suggests tailored development strategies and measures to provide more scientifically grounded policy insights. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Lancang-Mekong River Basin is facing booming water resources infrastructure development, long-term transboundary conflicts and trade-offs between economic goals and ecosystem services provision. Optimizing the pathway towards sustainable infrastructure operation has lacked multisector-coordinated and decision behaviour-based perspectives for transboundary water systems. In this study we quantified how, and to what extent, transboundary cooperation generates economic and environmental co-benefits by jointly using a coupled simulation–optimization approach and cooperative game theoretical analysis. We found that full cooperation outweighs partial or non-cooperation modes to promote economic benefits by 3 to 21% and to minimize the losses in fishery and sediment transport from 23% and 60% to 12% and 22%, respectively. Full cooperation becomes more beneficial and stable alongside infrastructure expansion, climate change and satisfying the hydrological needs of river ecosystems. These findings underscore the importance of full cooperation for sustaining socio-environmental systems and highlight the need for a benefit reallocation mechanism and designed flow management to stabilize basin-level full cooperation in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.

AB  - Sustainable production and consumption in the rural regions remains a barely tried yet important issue for contributing to rural sustainability these days. In particular, the sustainable livelihood of rural farmers has not been fully investigated for those in rural areas with high agricultural pollution emissions and a poor ecological quality of agricultural production in China. Also affected are farmers with a low living standard and output, or suffer from social inequity. The sustainable livelihood security (SLS) index therefore provides a useful means of identifying the existence of the conditions necessary for sustainable livelihood or sustainable development. Using the fuzzy comprehensive method, this paper aims to assess the level of sustainable livelihood security of China's provincial farmers and its three components of ecological security, economic efficiency and social equity. A SLS index is established and the entropy weight method used to determine the weight of the indices and analyze spatial distribution. The results indicate that the sustainable livelihood security index and its components vary between provincial regions, with the western provinces being most adversely affected, sustainable livelihood, economic efficiency and social equity being the least secure (or relatively insecure) in the western provinces while economic efficiency is most secure (or relatively secure) in the eastern and middle provinces, and social equity most secure in the eastern provinces. Concluding remarks suggest policies designed to improve the sustainable livelihood security of farmers according to local regional circumstances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Water scarcity and carbon emissions are two of the most pressing issues facing the world. Water rights trading (WRT) and carbon emissions trading (CET) can alleviate pressure on resources and the environment and promote sustainable development. However, the relationship between water scarcity and carbon emissions results in a complex water-carbon nexus between sectors. To explore the mechanisms of interaction among related sectors in the context of WRT and CET, this study built a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes the agriculture, industry, and forestry sectors (AIFSs) to simulate the strategic evolution process and interactions between stakeholders based on replicated dynamic equations. Four cities in the Dongjiang River Basin (DRB) in southern China were analyzed to quantify the influence of key parameters on the strategic evolution process and reveal the relationship between sectors under the effect of WRT and CET. The results indicated that There is a significant impact of agricultural net benefits in the DRB on the choice of AIFS strategy, which in turn leads to better WRT that promotes the mutual coupling of AIFS strategies. In addition, strategy coupling brings higher relative returns and risks to the game system, and multiple markets enable AIFS to hedge losses that may result from single market failures in the mutual game. Furthermore, AIFS' behavioral strategies are not necessarily aligned with market expectations, which has implications for us as we guide the development of WRT and CET. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Realizing water usability and management sustainability represents one of the Sustainable Development Goals. Since grain cultivation consumes tremendous amounts of water, the inter-regional grain trade causes virtual water flow, increasing water stress in certain water-scarce regions. As the second-longest river in China, the Yellow River bears increasingly severe water stress. Considering water and food security, this study proposes a spatial equilibrium model (SEM) that combines partial equilibrium theory and transport models to maximize net social revenue and to balance grain supply and demand, thereby optimizing inter-regional grain trade to relieve water stress. According to different natural, technical and social conditions, we conceived five scenarios to predict regional water stress characterized with different water supplies, demographic structures, food demand compositions and water-saving technologies. Our simulation results suggest that the developed SEM can realize spatial equilibrium of food and water resources within the Basin, which is capable of resolving the problem of food demands in regions with varying extents (13%-55%), optimizing inter-regional grain trade and mitigating water stress. Finally, we recommend some constructive policies for different scenarios to relieve water stress. © 2022 IWA Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Resource-dependent cities face the significant challenge of industrial transition under resource and environmental constraints. However, the interplay between industrial and environmental variables and their resilience trajectories have received insufficient attention to date. A constraint–adaptation framework was established to quantify the constraint–adaptation trajectory and resilience transitions of the industry–environmental system in the transition pilot of Baiyin City, western China. In this framework, an environmental performance index (EPI) was employed to reveal constraints of seven resource and environmental variables on local industrial development, combining with industrial indicators (i.e., industrial structure entropy and the shift-share method) to reflect the industrial structure adaptation. The resilience trajectories of seven resource and environmental variables were simulated to depict the industry–environmental system resilience dynamics using the four-phase adaptive cycle theory. Results from 1990 to 2016 in Baiyin City demonstrate that: (1) heavy dependence on mineral and energy resources, and resulting solid waste and atmospheric pollution, undermined local industrial competitiveness; (2) The competitiveness of secondary industry experienced a descending trend since 2011, while the total increase fell dramatically with total deviation of −30.64%; (3) the system underwent a vulnerable resilience transition to great adaptive capacity, with most resilience values greater than 0.5 (ascending adaptive capacity with resilience values from 0 to 1) in the past five years; (4) aggressive transition measures must be adopted to enhance adaptive capacity in the local industry–environmental system and foster co-benefits. This study provides a model to explore the transitions of resource-dependent cities in and beyond China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - China is simultaneously the world's biggest polluter, largest victim of pollution, and most ferocious fighter against pollution. So the question is: How can pollution be reduced to pave the way for the ecological civilisation of the future moderately affluent Chinese society? For China to play a leading role in escaping the global environmental crisis, for the benefit of its own population and the rest of the world, technological improvements and the greening of the economy, important as they are, will not suffice. More is needed in terms of limiting resource consumption, namely a reorientation from economic growth towards sustainable consumption and sufficiency. Improving efficiencies on all levels by technological and social innovations is a condition for this, as is a change of consumer aspirations from more to better, towards sufficiency and a good life. Chinese philosophical traditions and values offer anchoring points for such a green enlightenment. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - Strategies to reduce carbon emissions are set to be a powerful force of economic restructuring, creating new economic opportunities, and also disruption and divestment for some firms and sectors. A pressing issue for ‘just transitions’ is whether low carbon economic restructuring will challenge or reinforce prevailing geographies of spatial inequality and labour market (dis)advantage. In this article we return to the economic restructuring literature of the 1980s and 1990s to provide a theoretical framework for understanding ‘spatial divisions’ of low carbon work and how they might be shaped to ensure economically just transition. Our approach foregrounds questions of skills, training and pathways to employment across supply chains as key dimensions of just transition, providing a framework for analysis and intervention. The paper, therefore, brings new critical perspectives on low carbon transitions by conceptualising decarbonisation as a form of spatial economic restructuring and its potential implications in reinforcing and/or working against the existing patterns of uneven spatial development. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This study explores the intricate relationship between agricultural productivity and the pursuit of a just energy transition in China. As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and a nation grappling with environmental degradation and socio-economic disparities, China faces the imperative to transition toward a more sustainable and equitable energy system. This paper investigates the role of agriculture in this transition, recognizing its pivotal position as a significant emitter of greenhouse gases while also being vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. By examining the potential synergies and conflicts between agricultural productivity enhancement and the goals of reducing emissions and promoting social justice, this study aims to shed light on strategies that can effectively align agricultural development with the objectives of a just energy transition. The result indicates substantial internal disparities and strong agglomeration effects (referring to areas with similar agricultural total factor productivity) within China's agricultural total factor productivity distribution. Over the past 17 years (2005–2021), the average agricultural productivity has shown a commendable upward trend, marking a 2.8% growth rate. This increase signifies ongoing efforts and advancements in the agricultural sector, leading to improved productivity levels. Our results also show a significant positive spatial correlation in agricultural total factor productivity, suggesting a tendency for spatial agglomeration. The years 2005 and 2021 stand out as periods marked by significant adverse effects resulting from the interplay of diverse factors on agricultural productivity. By integrating findings from various sectors, this study provides insights into the complex interplay between agriculture and energy transition, emphasizing the need for integrated, holistic approaches that prioritize sustainability, fairness, and resilience in China's pursuit of a just energy future. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Energy poverty and climate change are global challenges. While the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has fostered energy cooperation and alleviated energy poverty in BRI countries, its impact on climate change requires careful examination. This study investigates the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions in BRI countries and analyzes the underlying mechanisms. In particular, this study constructs an integrated energy poverty assessment framework that includes three dimensions of energy accessibility, cleanliness, and affordability and utilizes the entropy-TOPSIS method to assess the status of energy poverty in 70 BRI countries. Subsequently, an empirical analysis using the Gini index as an instrumental variable was conducted to explore the impact of energy poverty alleviation on carbon emissions and the specific mechanisms. It is found that alleviating energy poverty in BRI countries will lead to an increase in per capita carbon emissions. However, improving energy cleanliness is effective in reducing per capita carbon emissions, while improving energy affordability has no significant impact on carbon emissions. This study shows that energy poverty alleviation and carbon emission reduction are two non-conflicting sustainable development goals. BRI countries can synergize energy poverty alleviation and carbon emissions reduction by focusing on clean energy development and providing energy subsidies. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Cereal crop production in sub-Saharan Africa has not achieved the much-needed increase in yields to foster economic development and food security. Maize yields in the region’s semi-arid agroecosystems are constrained by highly variable rainfall, which may be worsened by climate change. Thus, the Tanzanian government has prioritized agriculture as an adaptation sector in its intended nationally determined contribution, and crop management adjustments as a key investment area in its Agricultural Sector Development Programme. In this study, we investigated how future changes in maize yields under different climate scenarios can be countered by regional adjusted crop management and cultivar adaptation strategies. A crop model was used to simulate maize yields in the Singida region of Tanzania for the baseline period 1980–2012 and under three future climate projections for 2020–2060 and 2061–2099. Adaptation strategies to improve yields were full irrigation, deficit irrigation, mulch and nitrogen addition and another cultivar. According to our model results, increase in temperature is the main driver of future maize yield decline. Increased respiration and phenological development were associated with lower maize yields of 16% in 2020–2060 and 20% in 2061–2099 compared to the 1980–2012 baseline. Surprisingly, none of the management strategies significantly improved yields; however, a different maize variety that was tested as an alternative coping strategy performed better. This study suggests that investment in accessibility of improved varieties and investigation of maize traits that have the potential to perform well in a warmer future are better suited for sustaining maize production in the semi-arid region than adjustments in crop management. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This article assesses current and proposed European Union (EU) climate and environmental law, and the legal instruments associated with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), to see whether soil carbon sequestration is sufficiently promoted as a promising example of 'climate-smart agriculture'. The assessment shows that current and proposed policies and instruments are inadequate to stimulate large-scale adoption of soil carbon projects across Europe. Given the identified structural flaws, it is likely that this is true for all climate-smart agricultural practices. An alternative approach needs to be developed. Under EU climate policy, agriculture should be included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) by allowing regulated industries to buy offsets from the agricultural sector, following the examples set by Australia and others. The second element of a new approach is aimed at the CAP, which needs to be far more focused on the specific requirements of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet, such stronger focus does not take away the need to explore new income streams for farmers from offsets under the ETS, as the CAP will never have sufficient funds for the deep and full transition of Europe's agriculture sector that is needed. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Sufficiency aims at a total reduction of resource consumption, which is urgently needed to achieve our climate and sustainable development goals. This paper explores individual attitude towards a sufficiency-oriented lifestyle as a driver of a low carbon footprint. Survey data of 310 participants was analyzed to test whether individual sufficiency attitude manifests in people's carbon footprint. The results provide evidence for this relationship but its strength varies between behavioral domains – that is, heating, electricity, food consumption, everyday mobility, air travel. Potential structural and individual barriers to reducing CO2 emissions are discussed as possible factors that could explain differences between the behavioral domains. We argue that intrapersonal factors matter for sustainable lifestyles but that policy-making and structural change should complement and facilitate voluntary endeavors to achieve low-carbon lifestyles. ©2019 C.

AB  - Over the last decade, ‘responsible sourcing’ has become a topic of broad interest. Policymakers, consumers and companies refer to ‘responsible sourcing’ as a way to address sustainability risks in globalized mineral supply chains, but the term is used to refer to a wide range of sustainability objectives pursued by a variety of approaches. To address the need for a definition and structuring of the topic, a review was performed of the existing literature and of company policies on ‘responsible sourcing’ of minerals. The study develops a framework for responsible sourcing, here defined as ‘the management of social, environmental and/or economic sustainability in the supply chain through production data’. We propose that ‘responsible sourcing’ should be used as an umbrella term encompassing all sourcing designed to be ‘socially responsible’ ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’. Two approaches to managing responsible sourcing of minerals were identified: supply chain due diligence and sourcing via sustainability schemes. This study maps the sustainability requirements of such schemes and uses these to categorize them as socially responsible sourcing, sustainable sourcing or green sourcing. It also identifies the extent in the supply chain to which the schemes provide assurance or certification and how far traceability extends. The study provides a framework for future research and a springboard for further development of approaches to responsible sourcing that can be used by both companies and academics. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Climate change, food security, and energy crisis are becoming more intense in our world. Oil palm can be utilized in both the food and biofuel industries. To respond to the crisis, it is necessary to develop palm oil products besides vegetable oil and biodiesel. This article focuses on the development of strategies to research oil palm throughout the supply chain in Thailand. The SWOT factors (the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) are recognized via interviews with stakeholders. These stakeholders are feedstock producers, crude palm oil (CPO) producers, government agencies, biodiesel producers, palm oil refinery producers, and researchers. The results obtained from the data collection were analyzed and led to the formulation of strategies for future research on oil palm by the TOWS matrix. According to this analysis, future palm oil research framework strategies should consist of four categories: (1) oil palm management policy, developing regulation and economic instruments of various forms to systematically manage the oil palm industry, and applying big data and smart innovation to analyze market behavior; (2) oil palm breeding and production technologies, developing smart innovation in line with farmers’ lifestyles, and supporting research on oil content analysis and harvesting technology; (3) oil palm biomass conversion technologies, assessing environmental impacts through life cycle technology, evaluating the potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing the consumption rate of palm biomass; and (4) palm-based oleochemical products, developing oleochemical technology at the industrial level, expanding the potential capacity of producing oleochemical derivative products, and increasing the consumption rate and value added of CPO. All four frameworks were detailed and revised in line with the information obtained from seminars, comments, and interviews to meet the needs of all stakeholders. This framework will help drive the Bio-Circular-Green economy model in the future. Copyright © 2022 Usapein, Tuntiwiwattanapun, Polburee, Veerakul, Seekao and Chavalparit.

AB  - This book explores the emergence and development of the legal concept of fair and equitable benefit-sharing, and its application in agriculture. Developed in the 1990s, the concept of fair and equitable benefit-sharing has been deployed in an ever-wider variety of international instruments, including those on biodiversity, climate change and human rights. A lack of clarity persists, however, on what fair and equitable benefit-sharing requires and entails, and whether its implementation supports or eventually undermines equity and justice. This book examines these questions in the area of land, food and agriculture, addressing for the first time several instances of the agricultural production chain, including research and development, land governance and land use and access to markets. It identifies challenges regarding implementation of the concept as enshrined in environmental treaties and soft-law instruments, with a focus on the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, the Voluntary Guidelines on Tenure and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants. It investigates its role, enabling conditions and limitations, in a contradictory policy context involving environmental, food security and human rights objectives but also a growing web of multilateral and bilateral trade and investment agreements. Linking international law research with a socio-legal analysis, the book addresses four grassroots examples, which offer ideas for institutional and legal innovation from the local to the global level. This interdisciplinary title will be of great interest to students and scholars of international environmental law, agriculture, land law, development studies and global governance, as well as policymakers and practitioners working in these fields.

AB  - Today, the circular economy is regarded as a promising alternative for modern economies to preserve “virgin” natural resources for future generations by valorizing waste materials. The concept is also used to promote the goals of sustainable development, where, apart from the environmental dimension, the economic and social dimensions are also integrated. So far, the largest part of the related research has emphasized the environmental and economic dimensions, while little attention has been paid to the social dimension of circular economy. Thus, this paper develops a framework to evaluate the social impacts of circular products and materials throughout their life cycle, which is based on social life thinking, circular economy principles and strategies and social responsibility principles. Moreover, computational examples are presented to show the functionality and applicability of the proposed framework. Finally, critical points for future research are pinpointed in order to assist scholars in applying and improving such frameworks through case studies, helping them to better understand the social aspects of circular economy. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - To solve the energy crisis and protect the ecological environment has been the central concern of the sustainable development debate. The reproducibility and lower environmental impacts of bioenergy have attracted increasing attention in the debate. This research investigates the potentials of growing rapeseed in winter fallow fields across the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) to serve the goal of boosting bioenergy production and improving edible oil security in China. It first quantifies the extent of winter fallow fields in the Basin and identifies the accurate starting and ending dates of the fallowing at the grid-cell level. It then matches the fallowing periods with the growing period grid-by-grid and assesses the current and future potentials of rapeseed production across the matched grid-cells in the region. The assessments take into consideration of climate change adaptations on sowing dates and on the choice of varieties with suitable growth cycle length. Finally, by coupling the Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ) model and CHINAGRO-II economic model, this research simulates economically meaningful levels of rapeseeds production and trade for 2020 and 2030. A 60% realization of the production potential would increase total rapeseed supply by 9.1 million tons, reduce China's rapeseed import to zero and further reduce soybean import by 8.1 million tons in 2020. In 2030, the import of rapeseed would be reduced from 15 million tons under baseline to 7.3 million tons. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the American West water is becoming an increasingly scarce resource. Obligations to bordering states, endangered species protection, and long-term resource sustainability objectives have created a need for most western states to reduce the consumption of irrigation water. In Nebraska specifically, the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources (NDNR) and local Natural Resource Districts (NRDs) are meeting a large part of this need by using a regulatory approach, commonly called groundwater allocation. The cost of allocation, which occurs in the form of reduced economic returns to irrigation, could be greatly reduced by using an integrated cap and trade approach. Much like environmental cap and trade programs which are used to reduce the cost of limiting environmental pollution, the trading of capped groundwater allocations can reduce the cost of limiting water use. In an analysis of a typical case in the Nebraska Republican Basin, we found that the impact of a water market to trade groundwater allocations depended on the size of the allocation and on the characteristics of the land and irrigation systems involved in the trade. Potential economic benefits from trade ranged from US$0 to US$120 per 1,000 cubic meters traded, from US$25 to US$250 per 1,000 cubic meters of reduction in consumptive use, and from US$16 to US$50 per hectare of irrigated land in the region. The highest benefits occurred at relatively high allocations, which capped withdrawals at 65-75% of the expected unrestricted pumping level. These gains from trade would be split between buyers and sellers based on the negotiated selling price. © 2009 American Water Resources Association.

AB  - The economic and leadership importance of South Asia is rising as the centre of global economy is shifting towards Asia from the west. This growing importance provides an opportune crossroads for South Asia to meet the challenges of poverty, peace and environmental degradation that is facing its region and the world, and increase its economic and political standing in the global economy. For its economic standing, economic integration is of the utmost importance, as it will enable South Asia to rival China economically and it will account for one of the largest trading blocks in the world. South Asia is made up of eight nations, along with seven South Asian Association Regional Co-operation (SAARC) states and Afghanistan. Recent evidence indicates that South Asia has shown strong growth over the past decade. In Table 18.1, it is clear that India is leading the growth by doubling its GDP from US$478 billion in 2001 to nearly US$911.2 in 2006. However, South Asia is the home to over one-�?fth of the global population living in an area half the size of China. It has the largest concentration of the world’s poor in absolute terms. In 2004 there were an estimated 445.6 million who lived below US$1 a day and 1,115.3 million people who lived below US$2 a day, which comprised nearly 30.8 per cent and 77.1 per cent of the total population respectively (see Table 18.2). The incidence of poverty is much higher in South Asia compared with East Asia and the Paci�?c and Latin America and the Caribbean. Given its sheer size South Asia could play an important role in poverty reduction. The number of people who live on less than US$1 a day declined between 1999 and 2004, suggesting some poverty alleviation (Table 18.2). Despite high growth for the past decade in some South Asian countries, the prevalence of poverty indicates the extent of income inequality in the region. Its health conditions are also quite diverse with, for example, one of the highest proportions of underweight children in the world. In terms of education, Pakistan has one of the lowest primary school enrolment ratios in the whole of Asia Paci�?c region. In Bangladesh, the Maldives and Pakistan the enrolment in secondary schools is low compared with primary school enrolment (Table 18.3). Despite positive steps being taken for widespread primary education and targeted programmes for secondary education in South Asia, there exists wide gaps across countries in enrolment ratios between females and males. © 2011 Raghbendra Jha.

AB  - Modelling and optimization techniques for water resources allocation are proposed to identify the economic value of the unsatisfied municipal water demand against demands emerging from other sectors. While this is always an important step in integrated water resource management perspective, it became crucial for water scarce Countries. In fact, since the competition for the resource is high, they are in crucial need to trade values which will help them in satisfying their policies and needs. In this framework, hydro-economic, social equity and environmental constraints need to be satisfied. In the present study, a hydro-economic decision model based on optimization schemes has been developed for water resources allocation, that enable the evaluation of the economic cost of a deficiency in fulfilling the municipal demand. Moreover, the model enables efficient water resources management, satisfying the demand and proposing additional water resources options. The formulated model is designed to maximize the demand satisfaction and minimize water production cost subject to system priorities, preferences and constraints. The demand priorities are defined based on the effect of demand dissatisfaction, while hydrogeological and physical characteristics of the resources are embedded as constraints in the optimization problem. The application to the City of Amman is presented. Amman is the Capital City of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, a Country located in the south-eastern area of the Mediterranean, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. The main challenge for Jordan, that threat the development and prosperity of all sectors, is the extreme water scarcity. In fact, Jordan is classified as semi-arid to arid region with limited financial resources and unprecedented population growth. While the easy solution directly goes to the simple but expensive approach to cover the demand, case study results show that the proposed model plays a major role in providing directions to decision makers to orient their policies and strategies in order to achieve sustainability of scarce water resources, satisfaction of the minimum required demand as well as financial sustainability. In addition, results map out national needs and priorities that are crucial in understanding and controlling the complexity of Jordan's water sector, mainly for the city of Amman. © Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The core idea of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is that the human condition is tightly linked to environmental condition. This assertion suggests that conservation and development projects should be able to achieve both ecological and social progress without detracting from their primary objectives. Whereas "win-win" projects that achieve both conservation and economic gains are a commendable goal, they are not easy to attain. An analysis of World Bank projects with objectives of alleviating poverty and protecting biodiversity revealed that only 16% made major progress on both objectives. Here, we provide a framework for anticipating win-win, lose-lose, and win-lose outcomes as a result of how people manage their ecosystem services. This framework emerges from detailed explorations of several case studies in which biodiversity conservation and economic development coincide and cases in which there is joint failure. We emphasize that scientific advances around ecosystem service production functions, tradeoffs among multiple ecosystem services, and the design of appropriate monitoring programs are necessary for the implementation of conservation and development projects that will successfully advance both environmental and social goals. The potentially bright future of jointly advancing ecosystem services, conservation, and human well-being will be jeopardized unless a global monitoring effort is launched that uses the many ongoing projects as a grand experiment. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

AB  - Climate-resilient irrigation is a necessity for sustainable development, aligning with broader goals of poverty alleviation, food security and environmental stewardship. By embracing adaptive strategies and fostering collaborative efforts, communities can navigate the challenges posed by a changing climate, safeguarding livelihoods and ecosystems. Climate-resilient irrigation can improve coping measures and build resilience for communities through pathways which help improve agriculture. The relationship between agriculture, irrigation, water resources and climate change calls for an evolution of traditional irrigation practices towards climate-resilient irrigation approaches, such as farmer-led irrigation development; innovation and modernization to ensure the long-term viability and functionality of irrigation systems and infrastructure; financing mechanisms to support the transition towards climate resilience; partnerships between governments, international organizations and the private sector to mobilize resources effectively; and efficient service delivery mechanisms, promoting equitable access and effective management of water resources. Emphasizing the need climate-resilient irrigation to balance food production and water security, this essay advocates a paradigm shift towards sustainable water management, ensuring resilience in the face of climate uncertainties while safeguarding agricultural productivity and environmental integrity for a livable planet. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - It is widely recognized that many African economies are being transformed by rapid economic growth driven largely by rising demand for the abundant natural resources scattered across the African continent. I critically review the mainstream gamechanging dynamics driving this process, with special reference to a set of influential policy-oriented documents. This is followed by an analysis of less-recognized game-changing dynamics that have, in turn, been affected by the mainstream game-changing dynamics. These less-recognized game-changing dynamics include energy infrastructure challenges in a context of climate change, securing access to water, access to arable soils, slum urbanism, and food security responses. These mainstream and less-recognized game-changing dynamics provide the context for analyzing a range of African actor networks engaged in social and system innovations. I use a transdisciplinary framework to discuss these actor networks and how they construct their understanding of the game changers affecting their programs and actions. Based on a case study of the iShack initiative in Stellenbosch, South Africa, I conclude that social and system innovations will need to be driven by transformation knowledge co-produced by researchers and social actors who can actively link game-changing dynamics that operate at multiple scales with local-level innovations with potential societal impacts. © 2016 by the author(s).

AB  - Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) represent 22% of global greenhouse gas emissions. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, the AFOLU sector greenhouse gases must be dramatically reduced and eventually transformed to net negative CO2e within this century. The decarbonisation choices will have significant environmental, social and economic impacts, yet few analytical frameworks exist able to account holistically for AFOLU mitigation strategies and their sustainable development impacts in a way that combines advantages of global and national approaches to decarbonisation pathways. This paper proposes a pathway design framework for AFOLU decarbonisation strategies that can help governments set targets across four types of levers (increasing sequestration; improving the emissions efficiency of agriculture; incentivising dietary changes; and displacing fossil fuels with bioenergy) and help them navigate potential synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development objectives (notably food security, biodiversity preservation, poverty alleviation and job creation), in a way that facilitates co-construction and discussion with main stakeholders. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - In the growing economy, the transport sector emerges as the primary generator of the most prevalent greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The medical sector is witnessing a significant expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) to uncover health insights and in transportation sectors to avoid traffic congestion. In general, truck transportations cause delay in deliveries and it emits more carbon. In the context of rural healthcare, the improper delivery of medicinal drugs and surgical equipment has resulted in disruptions for patients. To precise these issues and to promote sustainability, this study aimed to design a circular inventory system to control the waste through circular economy practices, reduce emissions by investing in AI technology, green technology, source reduction technology. Thus, this study uses AI-Drone transportation as an alternative to traditional truck-based delivery system for fast delivery and to reduce carbon foot prints. Green technology reduces anthropogenic GHG emissions by controlling the carbon under the carbon tax and carbon allowance system. This study employs reverse logistics to collect and remanufacture the waste and damaged items. Rather than landfilling, recycling of medical waste reduces emission and waste while conserving resources. Drones equipped with an AI smart capsule track the location and monitor the temperature of certain medical commodities. Taking this into consideration, Baghmara healthcare is used as a case study to develop the model and analyse the necessity of drone deliveries. This research is crucial to provide a support to people in rural areas with the fastest resources during emergency medical crises. Altogether, the study utilizes an appropriate algorithm to generate the optimal profit and ordering quantity for the buyer, manufacturer and integrated total profit by improving efficiency in emission reduction and waste reduction. Numerical and sensitivity analysis is demonstrated graphically using origin software to depict the impact on total profit and ordering quantity. This study can be concluded with the implementation of these 4 technologies, and with the government support, medical product supply chain can sustain with green environment and be profitable for all the participants in that chain. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Success in economic development over the past half-century was based on manufacturing-led export growth. Because the share of global employment in manufacturing is set to continue to decline, manufacturing will not play the same role in the future. The author deconstructs what enabled manufacturing to generate growth and structural transformation. The strategy proposed is multi-pronged, addressing separately, in different sectors, the challenges of learning, foreign exchange, and employment. A carefully designed, coordinated multi-sector strategy, with sectoral policies in agriculture, natural resources, manufacturing, and especially services, has the prospect of attaining the same success as the old manufacturing-led export strategy. To implement it, countries will require active industrial policies based on a new understanding of dynamic comparative advantage. The creation of a global reserve system could help provide the finance required for success. New development strategies will require greater balance among the market, state, and community-a perspective articulated in the Stockholm Statement. © United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER) 2021.

AB  - One of the major global trends linked to the process of globalization is the expansion of agro-industry into the humid tropics. Although agro-industry is an important source of income for Brazil, it is also leading to the displacement of local populations and extensive clearing of native vegetation. In this context, we focus on a second trend resulting from globalization in which financial institutions have demonstrated increasing concern with environmental and social responsibility, notably through the inclusion of environmental and social conditions in loans to the agricultural sector. In this article, we provide an assessment of the potential for this type of economic instrument to help reduce the negative impacts of agro-industrial expansion, and how the different actors who are shaping this debate (non-governmental organizations, industries, the finance sector, government) can best help to realize this potential. We evaluate this broader question through the lens of two International Finance Corporation loans to Brazil's Grupo Maggi, the world's largest independently-held soybean exporter. We identify four areas in which private sector self-regulation can improve to realize environmental and social performance goals: (a) Financial institutions and firms can increase the clarity, quality, timeliness, and regularity of monitoring and reporting; (b) Civil society can develop a more sophisticated approach to distinguishing between companies and initiatives that essentially maintain the status quo and those that are trying to improve; (c) Civil society can help to develop simple, standard measures of environmental and social performance of agricultural lands for use by financial institutions and firms in establishing environmental and social management systems; and (d) Governments can develop strong regulations that capitalize on voluntary regulation mechanisms' flexibility and efficiency, as well as developing incentive systems for producers and firms that demonstrate high social and environmental performance in their operations. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

AB  - The EU has spearheaded innovative legislation in 2019 to promote the financing of economic activities to tackle climate change. But the social aspects of tackling climate and environmental problems have received inadequate attention in the legislation. This has resulted in inconsistent legal definitions and unelaborated processes to ensure all economic and climate tackling activities are socially sustainable. In many cases climate changing activities have resulted from, or been combined with, breaching social and human rights. Providing opportunities to citizens and communities to (financially) redress environmental problems is important for a just transition. An integrated approach whereby ESG risks and long term impacts are integrated in all banking and investment decision-making should be urgently taken up by the Commission. Building on existing international standards, voluntary codes and expertise in the EU’s social sector would help to meet the existing challenges. Such EU policy should also be integrated in the EU’s international trade and investment treaties that create the competition from financial players outside the EU which might not integrate an ESG approach. © Cambridge University Press 2021.

AB  - Since 2008, energy and food markets ?those most fundamental to human existence ?have remained in turmoil. Resource scarcity has had a much bigger global impact in recent years than has been predicted, with ongoing volatility a sign that the world is only part-way through navigating a treacherous transition in the way it uses resources. Scarcity, and perceptions of scarcity, increase political risks, while geopolitical turmoil exacerbates shortages and complicates the search for solutions. The New Politics of Strategic Resources examines the political dimensions of strategic resource challenges at the domestic and international levels. For better or worse, energy and food markets are shaped by perceptions of national interest and do not behave as traditional market goods. So while markets are an essential part of any response to tighter resource supplies, governments also will play a key role. David Steven, Emily O'Brien, Bruce Jones, and their colleagues discuss what those roles are and what they should be. The architecture for coordinating multilateral responses to these dynamics has fallen short, raising questions about the effective international management of these issues. Politics impede here too, as the major powers must negotiate political and security trade-offs to cooperate on the design of more robust international regimes and mechanisms for resource security and the provision of global public goods. This timely volume includes chapters on major powers (United States, India, China) and key suppliers (Russia, Saudi Arabia). The contributors also address thematic topics, such as the interaction between oil and state fragility; the changing political dynamics of climate change; and the politics of resource subsidies © 2015 the brookings institution.

AB  - The relationship between human health and well-being, energy use and carbon emissions is a foremost concern in sustainable development. If past advances in well-being have been accomplished only through increases in energy use, there may be significant trade-offs between achieving universal human development and mitigating climate change. We test the explanatory power of economic, dietary and modern energy factors in accounting for past improvements in life expectancy, using a simple novel method, functional dynamic decomposition. We elucidate the paradox that a strong correlation between emissions and human development at one point in time does not imply that their dynamics are coupled in the long term. Increases in primary energy and carbon emissions can account for only a quarter of improvements in life expectancy, but are closely tied to growth in income. Facing this carbon-development paradox requires prioritizing human well-being over economic growth. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Biomaterials, used here to signify 100% biobased and biodegradable materials, can offer a promising solution for transitioning away from fossil-based resources, addressing the climate crisis, and combating plastic pollution. To ensure their environmental benefits, biomaterials must derive from regenerative, non-polluting feedstocks that do not compete with food or feed production. From this perspective, agricultural residues and by-products present a favorable feedstock option for biomaterials production. Although this is an improvement over sourcing them from primary crops, the sustainability of underlying agricultural systems must be considered. Furthermore, the nutrient value of biomaterials for specific soil ecosystems is often overlooked despite their compostability. In this research, we investigate the linkages between biomaterials development and regenerative agriculture, a set of farming practices that can effectively sustain the growing human population while enhancing, rather than degrading, ecosystem health. We explore interdependencies between biomaterials’ production and regenerative agriculture for biomass sourcing and nutrient return and suggest a methodological framework to identify mutual benefits. The extent to which regenerative farms can provide biomaterial feedstocks without compromising crop cultivation and ecosystem health is analyzed together with the potential of biomaterials to deliver beneficial nutrients and services to regenerative systems. Applying this framework to the Great Lakes Region, Michigan, USA, an agricultural hub facing environmental degradation and plastic pollution, reveals synergistic linkages that unlock novel circular economy opportunities, including local production of renewable biomaterials for various applications, enhancing food security and bolstering socio-ecological systems. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Unlike the situation in the European Union, where wheat breeding is almost exclusively in the hands of the private sector, public breeding of disease-resistant wheat with high baking quality has a long-standing tradition in Switzerland. Important increases in yield potential are still possible here. After World War I, wheat yield in other European countries increased rapidly due to a focus on mass production and a demand for high baking quality. The current annual breeding progress in mass-produced wheat remains at 1%, and large investments would be necessary to raise this rate to the 2.5% required for global food security. However, investment does not pay back when seed rotation is reduced to 50% as it is the case in some countries. Therefore, significant yield leaps cannot be expected in the near future. As the harvest index-the driving trait of the Green Revolution-is close to its theoretical maximum above 50% and thus no longer drives progress, smart-breeding may allow fast and precise breeding. Smartbreeding combines cheap and efficient molecular tools with new phenotyping techniques to produce novel varieties, such as hexaploid bread wheat. The theoretical possibility of doubling the photosynthetic efficiency is a silver line at the horizon, but it demands fundamental changes to an age-old breeding system. In the face of climate change and ongoing globalization, the reasonable use of new breeding tools will help us develop new productive wheat varieties that are tolerant to rapid changes from hot to cold or flooding to drought and are resistant to pests and diseases.

AB  - The Moroccan agricultural sector is facing emerging challenges. First, the country is characterized by a significant water stress, as the volume of renewable water per capita does not exceed 750cubic meters per year. In addition, climate change scenarios predict a decrease by 10 to 15% of average rainfall and a rise of 2°C in temperatures over the next decades. As a consequence, water scarcity will be exacerbated. Second, the current national agricultural strategy, namely the ‘Green Morocco Plan’, aims to increase the overall production of the agricultural sector. To do so, public authorities encourage the adoption of drip irrigation coupled with financial support for drilling boreholes and for pumping` equipment, e.g., to irrigate fruit trees and vegetables. As a consequence, in many areas of the country, groundwater depletion is of growing concern. Third, domestic markets have become saturated and fruit prices have plummeted, particularly citrus, hindering the original hypothesis of improved economic water productivity by horticultural crops. Moreover, the current agricultural strategy has neglected rain-fed staple crops, such as cereals and pulses, and farmers growing these crops receive limited support. Fourth, the whole economic growth of the country appears to remain highly vulnerable to the annual rainfall variability. Because of demographic growth, the country has become a net importer of food and feed, e.g., soft wheat, edible oils, dairy products (butter and cheese), maize, and soya meal, and this may be harmful for its food security. Fifth, Morocco remains a rural country, since 40% of its inhabitants are still considered as employed in the agricultural sector. This is already generating increased tensions on agricultural land. In particular, the numerous land tenure statuses often impede investments in agricultural activities that would be made on the long term. Despite these challenges, the growing domestic demand for food products constitutes a strong opportunity for improved livelihoods for the people employed in this sector. As a consequence, young farmers engage in innovative learning processes in order to achieve higher crops and livestock yields, as well as improved farms’ profitability. Altogether, these elements suggest that the Moroccan agricultural sector will need to actively face new challenges, especially in relation to water management in a context of climate change, sound extension services and improved labor remuneration, as well as the satisfaction of growing food demand. These challenges may require new governance standards, which impose not only to produce higher quantities of food products but also of better quality and to do so in an environmentally sustainable way. Priority should be hence set to capacity-building of human resources and to promoting rain-fed systems that integrate crops and livestock rather than focusing only on support to heavy investments in irrigation, with limited attention to market and environmental issues. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Coffee consumption is concentrated in the “Global North”, while production is mainly located in the “Global South”. This trade-driven dependency leads to the exploitation of natural resources. As an export-oriented cash crop, such dependency jeopardizes the existence of a fair distribution of the risks and revenues among all the actors taking part in its globalized supply chain. Coffee trees are mainly rain-fed and only partly irrigated. However, the increasing global coffee demand led to higher consumption of freshwater, which can exacerbate the stressed condition of already stressed water basins. This study quantifies the impact of global coffee consumption on water scarcity, considering the larger system made of producer and consumer countries. The global displacement of such impact is driven by consumer preferences. We found that the US, EU and Asian countries’ coffee consumption create impact on water scarcity mostly in African and South American countries, which is also representative of the economic disparities existing behind the global trade flows. Climate change will likely affect the varieties currently preferred by global consumers. Therefore, immediate environmental sustainability actions including water resource preservation are necessary to face current and future challenges. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent times arguments for conservation allying with corporations have been prominent and not least in the advocacy of ‘new conservation’. This has set up a false dichotomy between traditional conservation and concern for humanity. The supposed intrinsic/instrumental, human/non-human conflict in conservation appears as a diversion from the actual problem which is the modern organisation of society as a capital accumulating machine based on competition and shifting costs on to others. This is particularly evident in the corporate and financial forms of capitalism which have been taking over conservation, and more broadly environmental policy debates. Pragmatism in the form of ‘new conservation’ is argued to involve contradictions going back to Pinchot and encapsulated in modern ideas of sustainable development. This has accelerated environmental destruction and social inequity, exploitation and injustice. The loss of biodiversity will accelerate with the financialisation of Nature via a range of new instruments (e.g. biodiversity banking, trading, offsetting, green/blue bonds, species credits, extinction futures markets and climate catastrophe bonds) that are being promoted by major conservation NGOs (e.g. WWF, TNC). Preserving, empowering and developing alternative social-ecological forms of running economies is then seen as the central issue for protecting both humans and non-humans alike. Divisions in conservation are argued to be real conflicts over the form and function of economic systems and the currently dominant role of capitalism in its corporate and financial forms. © 2022

AB  - Today's engineers are not only expected to develop new products and technical solutions to everyday problems. Against the background of sustainable development (SD) they should also be involved in developing comprehensive long-term solutions for global interrelated socio-economic and environmental problems. These comprise poverty, climate change, energy supply, drinking water scarcity, and other features. Besides, even useful technologies that were developed for the improvement of the standard of living can have short-or long-term irreversible negative impacts on human life or the environment (e. g., cooling systems with non-explosive CFC gases were developed to improve safety at home and ended up being banned for their ozone-depletion poten tial). Therefore, engineers need to consider social and environ mental side effects as well as potential unintended impacts that could be caused by technological developments. Conse quently, methods for inter-and transdisciplinary impact assess ment (IA) should play a key role in engineering education (EE) right from the start. This paper points out some key questions for further research related to IA-relevant courses in EE.

AB  - With increasing textile consumption and limited sorting and recycling capacities, the EU faces major challenges in terms of managing its textile waste. This study investigates the environmental and socio-economic impacts of explorative policy scenarios for a more sustainable textile waste management system in Europe. These scenarios differ substantially in the amounts of textile waste generated and separately collected, closed-loop recycling capacities and textile waste exports. Our results show that sustainable textile waste management remains highly relevant for the sector. Still, without addressing in parallel prevention of textile waste generation via production and consumption patterns, a climate-neutral and circular textiles sector will be hard to achieve. Interventions in the waste management of textiles could reduce global warming impacts by up to 22.3 Mt CO2 per year, which translates to an 18% sector-wide impact by 2035. Depending on the intervention(s), the estimated required investment at present amounts to between 7 and 33 billion EUR. The study provides a valuable starting point for evidence-based decisions on future textile policymaking in Europe. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The immediate and long-term requirements of energy policy in Germany and the wider EU are widespread. In addition to meeting decarbonisation targets to mitigate climate change, energy policy must be designed in such a way that is socioeconomically advantageous, delivering multi-policy objectives of energy security, a stable environment for energy system operation, affordable energy prices for consumers and industry, and an environment conducive to economic growth. There has been much debate about the merits and weaknesses of alternative policy frameworks to deliver on emissions targets. Introduced in 2005, the EU emissions trading system (ETS) was designed to monetise the externalities associated with GHG emissions, with many citing the carbon price as providing the most efficient and cost-effective means of achieving a certain emissions target. By contrast, subsidies for renewable electricity generation and energy efficiency measures, when implemented alongside an emissions trading scheme, are often criticized for increasing the costs of emissions abatement and producing no additional environmental benefits. This chapter re-assesses the merits and weaknesses of this policy mix and explores the socio-economic impacts of alternative policy scenarios that achieve the same emissions target. We use E3ME, a global macro-econometric model, to show that environmental regulation and subsidies for energy efficiency and renewable investment at European level, when implemented alongside a carbon price, lead to improved long-term environmental and socio-economic outcomes compared to when a carbon price is the sole policy instrument. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Feeding 9-10 billion people by 2050 and preventing dangerous climate change are two of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Both challenges must be met while reducing the impact of land management on ecosystem services that deliver vital goods and services, and support human health and well-being. Few studies to date have considered the interactions between these challenges. In this study we briefly outline the challenges, review the supply- and demand-side climate mitigation potential available in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use AFOLU sector and options for delivering food security. We briefly outline some of the synergies and trade-offs afforded by mitigation practices, before presenting an assessment of the mitigation potential possible in the AFOLU sector under possible future scenarios in which demand-side measures codeliver to aid food security. We conclude that while supply-side mitigation measures, such as changes in land management, might either enhance or negatively impact food security, demand-side mitigation measures, such as reduced waste or demand for livestock products, should benefit both food security and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Demand-side measures offer a greater potential (1.5-15.6 Gt CO2-eq. yr-1) in meeting both challenges than do supply-side measures (1.5-4.3 Gt CO2-eq. yr-1 at carbon prices between 20 and 100 US$ tCO2-eq. yr-1), but given the enormity of challenges, all options need to be considered. Supply-side measures should be implemented immediately, focussing on those that allow the production of more agricultural product per unit of input. For demand-side measures, given the difficulties in their implementation and lag in their effectiveness, policy should be introduced quickly, and should aim to codeliver to other policy agenda, such as improving environmental quality or improving dietary health. These problems facing humanity in the 21st Century are extremely challenging, and policy that addresses multiple objectives is required now more than ever. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The shift towards energy is now a priority in Indonesia's efforts to promote sustainable development. With a growing recognition of the effects of climate change and the limitations of energy sources, the urgency to transition to clean and renewable energy options is on the rise. This study aims to investigate how transitioning to energy can enhance the well-being of communities. We aim to highlight critical insights by examining and thoroughly reviewing the literature. Firstly, ensuring energy practices is crucial for attaining development objectives. Energy plays a role in providing services like electricity, transportation, and household heating. Secondly, challenges related to infrastructure and energy accessibility remain hurdles in Indonesia's journey towards an energy transition. Despite advancements in energy initiatives, many remote areas still need access to electricity. Lastly, governmental intervention plays a role in steering a transition towards sustainable energy solutions. Private sector investment in renewable energy sources must be supported and directed through relatively strict policies, fiscal incentives, and regulations. Finally, the energy transition is an essential social and economic event, and appropriate policies need to be developed to promote a just transition and ensure the best outcomes for all stakeholders and society. To conclude, the energy transition in Indonesia requires a combination of government, private sector, civil society, and international stakeholder involvement. By working together across sectors, investing in renewable energy gen technology, and implementing advanced policies, Indonesia promotes transitioning to a more sustainable energy system and improving the overall welfare of society. © 2024, Malque Publishing.

AB  - Ecological practices such as intercropping maize (Zea mays) with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) have been promoted to combat parasitic weeds like Striga (Striga asiatica). Intercropping has been promoted across Africa as a Striga control practice (SCP) and food security measure. Despite past efforts, millions of smallholder farmers (cultivating < 2 ha of maize) still struggle to implement SCPs. Social and ecological factors that prevent SCP implementation are well documented in the literature, but their underlying interactions have remained elusive. System dynamics modeling can uncover these interactions and assess their effect on intercropping rates as well as Striga emergence. This study presents a participatory mixed methods approach to build a system dynamics model based on two theories: diffusion of innovations and resource pool dynamics. The model estimates the population of fields where Striga emerged in response to intercropped fields when various interventions were implemented. According to model simulations, if new policies are not enacted to support intercropping, Striga is likely to spread to 2,625,000 maize fields, parasitizing almost 75% of smallholder farms across Central Malawi by 2036. The participatory approach allowed us to evaluate several policies, one of which sustained enough adopters to limit Striga emergence to < 500,000 fields, reducing the weed’s threat to food security. This policy considers how input costs and erratic rainfall can lead to disadoption, therefore, supporting the implementation of five to six consecutive years of intercropping by providing both fertilizer subsidies and demonstration plots. In this study, our participatory approach has shown to develop a model that can highlight interactions in social ecological systems, their leverage points, and how they can be exploited to develop effective food security policies. © 2024 by the author(s).

AB  - Successfully managing climate change will require a broad policy focus that encourages the adoption and implementation of all viable net-zero pathways. Solutions that focus on the elimination of hydrocarbon fuels, rather than on managing green-house gas emissions, could have enormous unintended economic, security, and social justice consequences. The Net-Zero Producers Forum, with Canada as a founding member, is intended to provide a platform to advance a set of pragmatic and effective solutions to global climate challenges by fostering international cooperation among major hydrocarbon producers. The aim is to help achieve the necessary reduction in emissions in a sustainable manner. The objectives of the forum include support for development of net-zero strategies, promoting and implementing best practices, advancing carbon management technologies, and fostering cooperation on abatement of methane and fossil fuel combustion emissions. Transparent measurement and benchmarking tools will play an important role in carbon management and are critical to ensuing that technology and policy solutions are working as intended. © 2022 NPSIA.

AB  - To mitigate climate change while ensuring that the substantial benefits of a green economic transition are widely shared, the concept of a just transition has emerged as a pivotal element in climate strategies. Although the effectiveness of climate policies has been a subject of ongoing debate, the integration of just transition principles is often overlooked as a key component. This study employs China’s Low-Carbon City Pilot policy (LCCP) as a quasi-natural experiment and uses a time-varying difference-in-differences (DID) methodology to assess the impact of LCCP on wage distortions within firms. Using data from listed companies between 2006 and 2022, our analysis shows that the low-carbon policy itself may be a source of inequity, disproportionately benefiting capital at the expense of labour, thus exacerbating wage distortions and preventing labour from receiving fair compensation. This inequity undermines the principles of a just transition, as the allocation of policy resources tends to favour large firms, enhancing their pricing power and diminishing labour market flexibility. The economic outcomes of LCCP are mixed: while it accelerates the growth of capital share, it also leads to an unequal distribution between capital and labour. Furthermore, our exploration of the role of export trade in mitigating these distortions reveals that exports actually widen the disparity in wage distortions. Our study underscores the urgent need to prioritize equity in climate policies and improve labour allocation efficiency within climate action frameworks. We aim to provide decision-making support for the design and implementation of more equitable low-carbon policies in developing countries. Key policy insights Empirical evidence suggests that LCCP has led to unfair compensation for workers. These findings aim to guide the design of more equitable low-carbon policies in developing countries. We recommend that while mitigating climate change, governments prioritize reforms in factor markets to maintain order and protect workers’ rights. Policy evaluation should account for regional and firm-specific impacts, balancing regulatory oversight of large firms with targeted support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Addressing wage distortions requires confronting the systemic biases in policy execution that favour large firms and marginalize smaller ones. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article considers the particular features of the development of the agro-industrial complex (AIC) in the conditions of mining regions. The Kuzbass (Kemerovo region) has been chosen as the object of analysis. A conceptual approach to the food security of the industrial region is presented, in the framework of which the main goals and objectives, principles and directions of development of the agricultural sector of industrial regions are shown. The article systematizes the results of previous studies of the authors related to the conditions and development factors of the AIC of the Kemerovo region. It has been established that the Kemerovo region as an industrial region is characterized by specific features of the AIC development which have evolved under the influence of climate, the available natural resources and the results of local economic activity. The current state of the Kuzbass agro-industry suggests that the region cannot ensure high competitiveness in the main types of agricultural products and their processed products. In the current economic conditions, introduction of deep processing of agricultural products on an innovative basis, production of functional products, integration and cooperation of producers, and improvement of production technologies may become the promising areas for the development of the agro-industrial complex of the Kemerovo region. The development of these areas will make it possible to produce agricultural products and food products with higher added value, and therefore, to increase the competitiveness of the agricultural sector in the region. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.

AB  - Purpose: In recent times, sustainable investment gaining much attention within the investors’ community and it is broadly driven by environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. This study aims to examine the ESG-based sustainability index and economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Design/methodology/approach: Corporate sustainability assessment procedure yields Dow Jones sustainability indexes (DJSIUS) and ESG compliant firms become a member of such indexes. To uncover the effects of policy uncertainty as follows: the study considers EPU index, equity market policy uncertainty index, economic and political events for the period 2000–2017. The authors present the study using a conditional volatility framework. Findings: The correlation between the DJSIUS and policy uncertainty appears to be negative and statistically significant. It is apparent from the results that policy uncertainty does contain important ESG factors that explain the sustainable investment in US firms. Moreover, the stock market boom, credit crunch, Lehman collapse and fiscal crises have shown significant adverse effects on the sustainability index. More importantly, it is seen that investors’ sustainable investing considers presidential election years for portfolio planning; the uncertainty associated with the election years has also shown a negative impact on the sustainable returns. Practical implications: First, sustainability is essential for the long-term stakeholders’ wealth maximization under governments’ policy uncertainty such as constrained resources, demographic and climate-change-policy, societal expectations, public-policies, regulatory structure. Second, EPU creates new opportunities and risks for sustainable firms and sustainable investing. Originality/value: The study is novel in which the authors present the effects of uncertainty on socially responsible investing. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The combination of limited fresh water supplies, poor soils and hyper-arid environment (dryland system), and climate change impact in Gulf States (GS) constrains the local economic agricultural production of many crops grown for food and fodder. The difference between the Ecological Footprint of Consumption and the Biocapacity of GS, suggests a net deficit between the eco-resources generated and those consumed and wasted. Given these existing and predicted challenges, it would be hard for the GS to achieve food security unless there are considerable technological innovations in agriculture and water research to boost local production. To meet food security, GS may be seeking options of acquiring land abroad for agriculture. Leasing prime land in poor developing countries is questioned by many actors, so the sensible option is to acquire marginal (saline) lands in these developing countries, over one billion ha available globally, or acquire prime land in countries where there are resources surpluses (abundant soil and water resources) concentrated in ecological creditors' countries, which currently do not utilize their full biocapacity and the production cost is lower. In the former case, ICBA can significantly support GS in growing salt-tolerant crops (Biosaline Agriculture) in the marginal land acquired abroad and by bringing them into crop production through an integrated approach of reclamation of salt-affected lands, thus, paving the way forward for food security. Over the last 13 years ICBA has developed a world-wide reputation for its expertise in the development of salt-tolerant germplasm and applied research and development in many of the 57 IDB-member countries including the GS. The groundwater in the GS is mostly saline or brackish and biosaline agriculture is the best approach. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. All rights are reserved.

Its contribution to environmental degradation intertwines with socio-economic inequality and labour exploitation. There are increasing calls for a green new deal (GND) to counter these dangers. This article argues that a GND for agriculture must combat environmental degradation, social inequality and labour exploitation, rather than aim to re-boot capitalist economies. This article identifies a number of areas for discussion and political action - reorientation of state subsidies, workers' rights, agrarian reform, the decommodification of food, agroecology, possibilities for urban agriculture, the application of new technologies, and rewilding. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Wheat, a staple crop, faces numerous challenges due to climate change and the increasing demand for sustainable practices. Biostimulants, which enhance plant growth and resilience, have gained attention for their potential to improve wheat productivity in an environment-friendly manner. This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of field-based research on wheat's response to biostimulants under field conditions from 2000 to 2024. Analyzing 222 studies, the bibliometric analysis reveals a significant rise in research publications on biostimulants, with an annual growth rate of 15.6%. Asia leads with the largest share of publications (59.4%), followed by Europe (18.1%) and Africa (11.6%). North America, South America and Oceania have fewer contributions. Additionally, research institutions in Pakistan, India and Egypt rank as the most productive on this topic. Saudi Arabia stands out with the highest percentage of international collaboration, at 91.7% between countries and 100% among institutions. The findings reveal that biostimulants significantly improve wheat's ability to withstand abiotic stress, optimize nutrient uptake, and enhance overall plant health. Research is transitioning from traditional organic methods and microbial inoculants to advanced biostimulant formulations, improved nutrient management, and reduced environmental impact. However, gaps remain, particularly in understanding the combined effects of multiple biostimulants and their long-term impact on wheat and soil health. This synthesis of research trends lays the groundwork for advancing sustainable wheat production, supporting food security and agricultural resilience amidst environmental challenges.

AB  - This paper examines the contradiction of economic globalization and environmental health. Despite the emergence of a significant environmental movement, the ecological health of many democratic industrial nation-states remains poor and the overall environmental health of the planet is declining rapidly (Brown 2000). The first section of this paper reviews literature that suggests that the inability of democratic industrial nation-states to reduce environmental degradation results from compromising environmental health in the interests of capital accumulation by regulating rather than eliminating environmentally destructive behaviors. The failure of democratic industrial nation-states to achieve environmental health is being exacerbated further by the creation of a globalized capitalist system managed by a variety of international free-trade agreements and the World Trade Organization. In the second section, we examine decisions made by these new managers of capital over the interests of environmental health. In the last section of this paper, we deconstruct the ideological tenets of global capitalism as they pertain to achieving environmental health and social justice.

AB  - Increasing the importance of sustainability in supply chain has motivated companies to redesign networks considering social and environmental responsibilities along with economic concerns. Food shortage, food waste and air pollution introduced as the main issues of global food and environmental problems. We propose a new mathematical model for redesigning food network in all aspects of sustainability. The objectives of the model are to minimize costs, transportation emissions, and unsatisfied foodbanks' demand. Foodbank as the main pillar of social responsibility has been introduced in food chain. In this paper, returned products divide into usable and recoverable products based on health security, in which usable products are not sellable but beneficial for those who do not care about appearance and can cover foodbank demand. Finally, computational study is made based on an Iranian food company data. The results reveal that more geographical diversity, using new distribution centers, and adding foodbanks helps to a sustainable network. © 2021, Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

AB  - To improve food security, plant biology research aims to improve crop yield and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, as well as increasing the nutrient contents of food. Conventional breeding systems have allowed breeders to produce improved varieties of many crops; for example, hybrid grain crops show dramatic improvements in yield. However, many challenges remain and emerging technologies have the potential to address many of these challenges. For example, site-specific nucleases such as TALENs and CRISPR/Cas systems, which enable high-efficiency genome engineering across eukaryotic species, have revolutionized biological research and its applications in crop plants. These nucleases have been used in diverse plant species to generate a wide variety of site-specific genome modifications through strategies that include targeted mutagenesis and editing for various agricultural biotechnology applications. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas genome-wide screens make it possible to discover novel traits, expand the range of traits, and accelerate trait development in target crops that are key for food security. Here, we discuss the development and use of various site-specific nuclease systems for different plant genome-engineering applications. We highlight the existing opportunities to harness these technologies for targeted improvement of traits to enhance crop productivity and resilience to climate change. These cutting-edge genome-editing technologies are thus poised to reshape the future of agriculture and food security. © 2019 Sedeek, Mahas and Mahfouz.

AB  - The rapid expansion of global food trade over the last decades has intensified the debate about its environmental impacts and the role of trade policies in resource conservation. This paper examines whether trade restrictions can effectively address environmental pressures by analyzing the complex linkages between international trade and natural resource exploitation. Through a critical review of the existing evidence, the paper shows that while trade-induced specialization does not always lead to a more efficient and sustainable use of resources, trade restrictions alone often represent a second-best solution. Because they do not address the market failures that shape resource exploitation in the first place, such restrictions risk being not only ineffective but potentially counterproductive. Successful environmental protection requires integrated policy approaches that recognize the intricate relationships between trade liberalization, resource management, and food security. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Climate change and food security are two of humanity’s greatest challenges and are highly interlinked. On the one hand, climate change puts pressure on food security. On the other hand, farming significantly contributes to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This calls for climate-smart agriculture—agriculture that helps to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Climate-smart agriculture measures are diverse and include emission reductions, sink enhancements, and fossil fuel offsets for mitigation. Adaptation measures include technological advancements, adaptive farming practices, and financial management. Here, we review the potentials and trade-offs of climate-smart agricultural measures by producers and consumers. Our two main findings are as follows: (1) The benefits of measures are often site-dependent and differ according to agricultural practices (e.g., fertilizer use), environmental conditions (e.g., carbon sequestration potential), or the production and consumption of specific products (e.g., rice and meat). (2) Climate-smart agricultural measures on the supply side are likely to be insufficient or ineffective if not accompanied by changes in consumer behavior, as climate-smart agriculture will affect the supply of agricultural commodities and require changes on the demand side in response. Such linkages between demand and supply require simultaneous policy and market incentives. It, therefore, requires interdisciplinary cooperation to meet the twin challenge of climate change and food security. The link to consumer behavior is often neglected in research but regarded as an essential component of climate-smart agriculture. We argue for not solely focusing research and implementation on one-sided measures but designing good, site-specific combinations of both demand- and supply-side measures to use the potential of agriculture more effectively to mitigate and adapt to climate change. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - The political economy of Pakistan’s water is a complex interplay of interests that in the modern era, beginning in the nineteenth century, emerged from within the context of colonialism. The foundation of the irrigated economy that was laid during British rule privileged particular norms of water control that, to large extents, persist and shape current policies. Given the rising and changing demands on the uses of water that have naturally arisen through the passage of time, coupled with a rapidly changing climate, prevailing water policy and allocation are hard-pressed to meet evolving societal, environmental, and economic goals. Particular and longstanding challenges arise from the political economy of interprovincial water-sharing and are further compounded by the changing geopolitics of transnational infrastructure finance within the prevailing narrative that privileges increasing supply over reducing or managing demand. Within and across sectors, a host of challenges arise from the failure to value water for its proper and integrated environmental, social, economic, and political uses. Meanwhile, the growing role of the private sector, in areas such as commercial groundwater extraction for drinking water as well as in beverage and industrial production more broadly that significantly impair water quality and the environment, remains a largely under-governed space. Since the British era, agriculture remains the foundation of the economy and with rising demands from a growing population, food and commodity security for both crops and dairy and livestock production within the context of global food production and trade flows have become ever more complex. These forces are playing out within the context of global climate change and evolving norms of water storage that take into account methane emissions from large dams as part of international climate pledges, further compounding Pakistan’s overall water, food and energy security goals. An improved understanding of local contexts as they interact with global trends will need to be developed to improve Pakistan’s political economy of water. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Increasing population demand has triggered the enhancement of food production, energy consumption and economic development, however, its impact on climate change has become a global concern. This study applied a novel environmental sustainability assessment tool using dynamic Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) simulations for model estimation of the relationships between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy, biomass, food and economic growth for Australia using data spanning from 1970 to 2017. The study found an inversed-U shaped relationship between energy consumption and income level, showing a decarbonized and services economy, hence, improved energy efficiency. While energy consumption increases emissions by 0.4 to 2.8%, biomass consumption supports Australia's transition to a decarbonized economy by reducing GHG emissions by 0.13% and shifts the demand for fossil fuel. Food and energy consumption underpin socio-economic development and vice versa. However, food waste from production and consumption increases ecological footprint, implying a lost opportunity to improve food security and reduce environmental pressure from agricultural production. There is no single path to achieving environmental sustainability, nonetheless, the integrated approach applied in this study reveals conceptual tools which are applicable for decision making. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The convergence of global crises sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental degradation, and supply disruptions due to regional conflicts in Europe and the Middle East has underscored the imperative for analyzing the drivers of green growth in emerging economies. While considerable research has focused on green growth in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) nations, there still is a significant gap in understanding Africa’s transition to a green economy. Fundamental questions about the key variables propelling Africa’s green growth, their interconnectedness, potential obstacles to green economy development, and the trajectory of future research in this area remain largely unaddressed in the extant literature. This review paper aims to evaluate the state of Africa’s green economy by synthesizing recent scientific literature on green growth in WEIRD nations from an African perspective. Employing an analytical approach grounded in holistic frameworks and systems thinking, the study conducts a thorough multidisciplinary assessment of existing research. Using the PRISMA systematic review approach, the search terms, databases, inclusion and exclusion criteria were designated for the study.In addition to exploring the challenges of green industrialization, the research investigates the driving forces and essential elements necessary for achieving Africa’s progress towards achieving net zero emissions. Common hurdles such as susceptibility to extreme climate events, natural disasters, and ecological degradation are found, alongside the potential benefits of attaining net zero emissions, including equitable distribution of climate benefits, reduction of adverse health impacts, and addressing social inequalities, particularly among low-income and vulnerable populations and communities. The contributions of this paper are as follows: firstly, it broadens knowledge about the possible forces propelling the green sector and how policy makers in Africa may be guided to design strategies for achieving net-zero economy in their particular context. secondly, Important gaps are found, common themes are recognized and addressed, and notable scholars and their own conceptual and theoretical contributions are all highlighted by this analytical examination. It is hoped that this paper will offer a theoretical and empirical foundation to inspire future researchers to take on the significant research tasks related to how environmental policy imperatives and domestic green growth interact with the global climate. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This work exhibits an extensive panel dataset and data descriptor on the crowdfunding-renewable energy nexus. This new source of data may find large use in energy economics, econometrics and policy, as well as financial and microfinance analysis. The referred dataset is made of 4704 observations to related to crowdfunding campaigns from 2009 to 2021. Data can be used for diverse energy econometrics studies and data analysis, especially for socioeconomic and environmental aspects of energy innovation and efficiency investigations. The contribution offered by this paper is the correlation between two salient aspects for the first time. We have cross-referenced the data related to crowdfunding campaigns with the sustainable orientation of the countries. The extrapolated data from two datasets—i.e., Zephyr Bureau Van Dijk and the World Bank’s World Development Indicators—form a new dataset that serves as a tool, as well as a guide, for future studies related to renewable energy, fintech, economic, innovation and entrepreneurship issues. Moreover, this contribution may stimulate the development of new policies and strategies aimed at supporting the transition towards the circular economy and sustainable development by creating positive externalities on a large scale by increasing social welfare and resilience applications. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - It is not difficult to make the case for greater World Bank Group involvement in improving the rural economy. The mandate of the World Bank Group is to help its clients reduce poverty and improve living standards through sustainable, broad-based growth and investment in people. Sustainable rural development can make a powerful contribution to four critical goals: 1) Poverty reduction, 2) Widely shared growth, 3) Household, national, and global food, security, 4) Sustainable natural resource management. The Bank's objectives of poverty reduction, widely shared growth, food security, and sustainable natural resources management cannot be met unless rural development in general, and a thriving agricultural economy in particular, are nurtured and improved. This premise is at the core of the recommended strategy for improving the rural economy. Four enormous challenges must be met: reducing poverty and hunger, riasing economic growth, increasing global food production, and halting natural resource degradation.

AB  - The transition to a bioeconomy holds promise for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and advancing sustainable development but also presents complex challenges. This perspectives article critically examines the environmental, social, and economic implications of shifting from fossil-based to bio-based resources, addressing key concerns such as land use competition, biodiversity loss, and social equity. Rising biomass demand poses sustainability risks, especially for the Global South, where it may exacerbate food insecurity and ecosystem degradation. Without careful management, this transition could lead to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and increased carbon emissions, undermining its intended benefits. To navigate these challenges, the article outlines pathways for an inclusive and sustainable bioeconomy transition. It emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate diverse knowledge systems and values to ensure the equitable distribution of benefits and risks. Policymakers should adopt governance frameworks that align sustainable development goals with local realities, fostering a just transition that mitigates socioecological challenges while maximizing long-term sustainability. © 2025

AB  - This chapter examines water security in the broader relationships governing the Food-Water-Energy-Climate Nexus. It particularly stresses the role of the great global transmissions of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in presenting intractable barriers to returning to less complicated eras of resource conflicts. These transitions are manifest in total and urban populations’ growth and shift to urbanization; radical shifts in the nutrition demanded by the new economic and social developments; the radical changes in land use and chemicals in agriculture; a rapid shift in emphasis on renewable energy resources and reduced reliance on fossil fuels; and finally the great challenge of climate change. All of these transitions have major implications for water security both globally, and regionally. Globally this is well articulated by DuBois (The case for “energy-smart food for people and climate”. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Food Day-Oct 16, 2015): Our agrifood systems currently consume 30 percent of the world’s available energy-with more than 70 percent occurring beyond the farm gate, and produce about 20 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. More than one third of the food we produce is lost or wasted, and with it about 38 percent of the energy consumed in the agrifood chain. To this we can add that the greatest loss of water in the overall national water balances is that of the water used to grow the food that is wasted. While the water security situation for the Arab Middle East Region is generally considered bleak, the paper is fairly optimistic that, at least water resource use, until 2050 will be still manageable if the eleven “technical fixes," outlined in the paper are pursued. These technical fixes are not to be construed as purely engineering the water supply, but fixes to many of the economic and social barriers to a more secure water future. They cover major national policy choices such as international trade in virtual water, traditional water engineering of traditional and non-traditional sources, improving efficiency in use via agronomic research, improvement of post harvest food and value chains, and softer optionssuch as trading among users, pricing, rationalizing property rights and legal protection for third parties. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Perennial grasslands, including prairie and pasture, have declined with tremendous environmental and social costs. This decline reflects unequal policy support for grasslands and managed grazing compared to row crops. To create a resource for community partners and decision-makers, we reviewed and analyzed the policy tools and implementation capacity that supports and constrains grasslands and managed grazing in the U.S. Upper Midwest. Risk reduction subsidies for corn and soybeans far outpace the support for pasture. Some states lost their statewide grazing specialist when the federal Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative lapsed. The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service support for lands with prescribed grazing practices declined after 2005 but remained relatively steady 2010–2020. These results reveal the policy disadvantage for grasslands and managed grazing in comparison with row crop agriculture for milk and meat production. Grassland and grazing policies have an important nexus with water quality, biodiversity, carbon and outdoor recreation policy. Socially just transitions to well-managed, grazed grasslands require equity-oriented interventions that support community needs. We synthesized recommendations for national and state policy that farmers and other grazing professionals assert would support perennial grasslands and grazing, including changes in insurance, conservation programs, supply chains, land access, and fair labor. These policies would provide critical support for grass-based agriculture and prairies that we hope will help build soil, retain nutrients, reduce flooding and enhance biodiversity while providing healthy food, jobs, and communities.

AB  - In recent years, a greater level of integration of the world economy and an opening of national markets to trade has impacted virtually all areas of society. At the same time, water scarcity and the phenomena of a 'global water crisis' have become part of our vocabulary. With most of the water worldwide being used for irrigated agriculture, and an increasing share of irrigated production being traded, trade policy has become intrinsically linked with both water and food security. While the process of globalization has the potential to generate long-term benefits for developing-countries, the distribution of those benefits is lessclear. Whereas countries with competitive (agricultural) production sectors and strong export potential have called for more open markets, those less competitive and fearful of adverse consequences on their farmers have been reluctant to increased liberalization efforts. Moreover, while the implications from changes in trade policy on national food production levels are often analyzed - albeit result of studies sometimes differ - impacts on water supply and demand, and water security are seldom studied and usually not known. This paper will analyze various alternative trade scenarios and their impact on food supply, demand, and water and food security using the recently enhanced IMPACT-WATER modeling framework.

AB  - World population growth has increased the demand for food and shelter, thus threatening environmental sustainability and expanding the gap between resource availability and the ability to meet human needs. Humans are fulfilling their needs by depleting natural resources. Currently, exploring plant species that can fulfill the life requirements of both humans and animals without degrading natural resources has become a major challenge. Therefore, research on underutilized crops is of high interest among plant scientists. Ramie, an ancient plant with a long history, is being researched because of its vigorous growth, high nutritional value and multipurpose applications in Textiles, livestock feed, environmental conservation and medicine. It can be cultivated in versatile conditions including tropical, subtropical and temperate regions. The present review article provides a detailed discussion on the multipurpose utilization and nutritional importance of ramie as well as potential applications and constraints, and the outlook for the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite our pretensions to science, modern industrial society is as myth-bound and mystical as any that has preceded it. Our prevailing cultural myth includes a dangerous vision of global sustainability and poverty reduction centered on unlimited economic expansion, "free" trade and technological fixes. This paper dissects the modern myth, exposing its conceptual flaws and practical failings. It then proposes an alternative conceptual framework for development derived from ecological economics and ecological footprint analysis. The new framework recognizes that the human enterprise is a subsystem of the ecosphere whose growth is constrained by biophysical limits. If humanity is to seize control of its destiny it must arise above wishful thinking and tribal instinct. Global society needs a new cultural myth rooted in humanity's unique claim to intelligence and self-awareness in the face of danger. Human security depends on equitable development-not growth-within the means of nature. Sustainability with social justice can be achieved only through an unprecedented level of international cooperation rooted in a sense of compassion for both other peoples and other species.

AB  - Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change-IPCC (2001, 2007a, 2007b) warns that the progress in human develop ment achieved over the last decade may be slowed down or even reversed by climate change, as new threats emerge to food and livelihood security, agri cultural production and access, and nutrition and public health. Agriculture constitutes the backbone of most developing economies throughout the world and in turn, food and fi ber production is essential for sustaining and enhancing human welfare (Rosenzweig and Parry 1994, Fischer et al. 1996). Consequently, agriculture has been a major concern in discussions on climate change. Agronomic and economic impacts from climate change depend primarily on two factors, i.e., (i) the rate and magnitude of change in climate attributes and the agricultural effects of these changes, and (ii) the ability of agricultural production to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Temperature, precipitation, atmospheric carbon dioxide content, the incidence of extreme events and sea level rise are the main climate change-related drivers which impact agricultural production (Adams 1998). Climate change, however, is considered as posing the greatest threat to agriculture and food security in the 21st century, particularly in many of the poor, agriculture-based countries with their low capacity to cope effectively (Darwin and Kennedy 2000, Adams et al. 1995). Mountain agriculture is already under stress as a result of population increase, industrialization and urbanization, competition over resource use, degradation of resources and insuffi cient public spending for rural infrastructure and services. The impact of climate change is likely to exacerbate these stresses even further. The outlook for the coming decades is that agricul tural productivity needs to continue to increase and will require more water to meet the demands of grow ing populations. Ensuring equitable access to water and its benefi ts now and for future generations is a major challenge as scarcity and competition increase. The amount of water allocated to agriculture and water management choices will determine, to a large extent, whether societies achieve economic and social development and environmental sustainability (Iglesias et al. 2000, Easterling et al. 1993). © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The rising temperatures impact the environment, economy, public health, and global climate. This rise can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions, urbanization, deforestation, and changes in oceanic currents. Higher temperatures pose a health risk and can result in dehydration and heat stroke while also affecting agricultural yields, aggravating water scarcity, increase in the frequency and intensity of hydroclimatic extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding, or droughts in different regions. Further, it can affect the construction, energy generation, and tourism industries. This paper highlights the fundamental factors behind the summer temperature rise in India and its impacts. The recommendations aim to improve the adaptation to the changes on individual and governmental levels. There is a need to encourage a carbon-neutral economy and tap into the resources for research and development of technologies. The paper also underscores the relationship between increased temperatures and the possibility of a pandemic in the future, as increased temperatures have the ability to change the pathogen behavior, and understanding the relationship between both is essential to formulate policies and future interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Port cities are on the front-line of a changing global urban system. There are problems from restructuring of trade, logistics and ship-building, creating economic dependency, social exclusion and cultural destruction. Meanwhile, there exists new opportunities in heritage tourism, cultural industries and ecological restoration, but these opportunities often have negative impacts. This paper addresses the question of how port cities can steer from negative to positive development paths and outcomes. It sets out a way of working with inter-connected economic, social, political and technological factors-a =synergistic' approach to mapping of problems and design of policy responses. Looking at three contrasting examples of port cities-Liverpool, Dubai and Mauritius-we can compare the inter-connected dynamics of growth and decline. Then we can understand the inter-connected factors of successful regeneration and sustainable prosperity, not as linear =policy fixes', but more like synergistic processes of learning, innovation and capacity building. These call for new models for creative innovation in social and community enterprise: cultural heritage both old and new; new social finance and investment; socio-ecological restoration with participative governance, etc. Such pathways and opportunities are now emerging in many different locations; this paper provides methods and tools to understand them and promote them. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Environmental innovation is pivotal in tackling climate change by offering diverse and practical solutions to reduce carbon footprints, promote resource conservation, and enhance ecological sustainability. As anthropogenic activities continue to accelerate global environmental degradation, innovative solutions are imperative for mitigating the impacts of climate change and fostering sustainability. However, the effectiveness of these innovations is threatened by global uncertainties and rising income inequalities. Uncertainties in geopolitical landscape and economic disparities may impede the development and widespread adoption of eco-friendly technologies and practices. Given the above background, this study empirically investigates the influences of environmental innovation, world uncertainty and income inequality on renewable energy generation for a balanced panel of 58 countries between 1990 and 2020. The estimated models also control for the effects of globalisation and economic growth. After diagnosing for necessary panel diagnostic tests including cross-sectional dependence, heterogeneity, and panel unit-root, the Westerlund cointegration test confirms a significant long-run relationship between the variables of the study. Using panel Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimation, the results reveal that while environmental innovation continues to promote the renewable energy generation, global uncertainty and income inequality hamper it. More importantly, the moderating effects of world uncertainty and income inequality reduce the favourable impact of environmental innovation on renewable energy generation. Besides, economic growth and globalisation continue to play critical roles in speeding up the quest for renewable energy. The PCSE estimation technique confirms the significance of these baseline findings. Potential policy implications are also discussed. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In India, where agriculture plays a major part in the economy, the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) has completely transformed crop management. By giving farmers real-time data on weather, soil quality, and environmental factors, they can now make more informed decisions, leading to reduced losses due to disease and increased productivity. The use of IoT technology extends beyond field monitoring to include underground soil sensing, machinery management, and sensor-based irrigation systems, creating a comprehensive support network. This network connects farmers, experts, and advisors, promoting sustainable and profitable farming techniques. With challenges like climate change and resource limitations becoming more prevalent, modern agriculture increasingly relies on technology to boost efficiency and output. The explores the role of various platforms, sensor networks, satellite imagery, cloud computing, and big data analysis in digital agriculture. These technologies facilitate data exchange and communication between devices, streamlining operations. The integration of technology and data analysis emerges as a crucial force in farming, helping farmers overcome obstacles and identify new opportunities amidst global food security concerns. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - The use of plastics has become deeply ingrained in our society, and there are no indications that its prevalence will decrease in the foreseeable future. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the global plastic waste disposal landscape, examining it through regional perspectives, various management technologies (dumping or landfilling, incineration, and reuse and recycling), and across different sectors including agriculture and food, textile, tourism, and healthcare. Notably, this study compiles the findings on life-cycle carbon footprints associated with various plastic waste management practices as documented in the literature. Employing the bio-circular-green economy model, we advocate for the adoption of streamlined and sustainable approaches to plastic management. Unique management measures are also discussed including the utilization of bioplastics combined with smart and efficient collection processes that facilitate recycling, industrial composting, or anaerobic digestion. Moreover, the integration of advanced recycling methods for conventional plastics with renewable energy, the establishment of plastic tax and credits, and the establishment of extended producer responsibility are reviewed. The success of these initiatives relies on collaboration and support from peers, industries, and consumers, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making and fostering sustainable practices in plastic waste management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agricultural commodities including fresh and processed foods are highly perishable in nature and resulting in the generation of significant agro-waste during harvesting, processing, and post-consumption. In recent years, agro-waste has received growing interest from the domestic and global perspectives, due to the growing concerns about food security and environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions attributed to intensified effects of global warming. Agricultural wastes are considered as hidden treasury for various bioactive compounds (e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), and potential sources of high-value products such as biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel, organic acids, enzymes, phenolic, and flavoring compounds. A novel approach for addressing the agro-waste is biorefinery which emerged as a sustainable way of valorization. Bio-refining food waste might help achieve sustainable zero-waste growth. Agro-waste biorefinery techniques urgently need a circular economy and contribute to a low-carbon, cleaner environment that is ecologically beneficial, economically, and technically feasible, and widely accepted. This chapter will comprehensively explain agro-waste with their sources, agricultural waste valorization status, and possible novel and green technology in an integrated biorefinery approach to recovery of the bioactive compounds and their application in the agro-processing sector. In addition, prospective research for managing waste and valorization approaches will be explored, along with their technical bottleneck and limitations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Following the actual pace of industrial development, due to the ever-growing tech- and resource-savvy society, unprecedented waste amounts are generated on a daily basis. Therefore, “waste-to-energy” (WtE) techniques appear as a possible approach to convert solid residues into energy, within more energy-efficient processes to emit less or no CO2. Plasma gasification constitutes a proficient and clean alternative with multiple environmental gains, simultaneously reducing or eliminating toxicity and pollution issues while avoiding the landfilling of huge amounts of residues. To evaluate the performance of this WtE treatment, the life cycle thinking (LCT) methodology gathers useful impact assessment tools, providing quantifiable indicators on multiple domains. The lack of works reporting the combined assessment of the environmental, technical, economic and social spheres of WtE has been previously noticed and, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no such review so far for plasma gasification. This work proposes a deep review of literature on the life cycle assessment, life cycle costing and social impact assessment of plasma gasification, to evaluate how LCT tools are applied to the energetic valorization of solid residues by this technique, as a measure of sustainability. This provides insights on the contribution of energy recovery as a circular strategy, diverting waste from open dumps or landfills, while producing renewable energy and/or by-products that will replace the use of virgin materials. Herein, an attempt to complement the knowledge in the sectors of renewable energies and waste management is conducted, to support the fulfillment of circular economy goals and contribute to a more sustainable society and way of living. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This book discusses social innovations by cooperatives from the Asia and Pacific region. Social innovations emerge when the state and market in developing countries find it difficult to solve problems such as poverty, hunger, ill health, poor education systems, inadequate drinking water and poor sanitation. These countries also face barriers to economic growth such as climate change, poor governance, unequal opportunities and social exclusion. This volume therefore addresses the following questions. What are the distinctive features of social innovations by cooperatives? How social innovations bring in changes in the process and outcome of development? After presenting theories of social innovation and a critical review of cooperatives and social innovation, the book presents 15 chapters on social innovations by cooperatives in the Asia Pacific region. These social innovations are related to health insurance, community based tourism, disaster response, climate smart agriculture, use of social media for youth empowerment, training for the emergence of second-line leaders in cooperatives, social inclusion through innovative finance, profitable marketing of organic produce to strengthen economic status of small farmers, digital auction and value addition for income security of farmer members, collaboration between cooperative members and workers for the mutual benefit, worker cooperatives, women leadership and participation, building union-cooperative partnership in finance and rating of cooperatives to promote transparency and accountability. A chapter on innovative services of cooperatives during the time of Covid19 is also included. This volume will be quite significant for co-operators, researchers, teachers, practitioners and policy-makers at the global level. The theme is relevant for international development community and national cooperatives with concern for their communities, which is the seventh cooperative principle of International Cooperative Alliance and the Sustainable Development Goal of the UN. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

AB  - Entrepreneurship, sustainability, and the creation of a resilient, green economy are intricately linked, particularly as conventional economic models grapple with existential challenges. However, empirical research addressing the connection between entrepreneurship and sustainability for a more balanced and resilient future is notably scarce. This chapter aims to bridge this gap by investigating the role of entrepreneurship in advancing sustainability and establishing a resilient, green economy. Through comprehensive research utilizing critical discourse analysis (CDA), three research questions were explored to draw insightful managerial and practical implications. In the intersection of entrepreneurship, sustainability, and a green, resilient economy, opportunities are seized by entrepreneurship amid limitations, while sustainability presupposes responsible management of resources for current needs without compromising the future. A green economy ensures adaptability, growth, and ecological stability even in resource-scarce conditions. The CDA affirms the influential role of entrepreneurship in pursuing sustainability and a green, resilient economy, drawing from 18 cases across public, private, and social sectors to highlight environmental, social, and economic impacts. Furthermore, the CDA uncovers power dynamics, ideologies, and social structures affecting entrepreneurship's role in fostering sustainable and resilient, green economies. Collaborations between governments, corporations, and social ventures in diverse countries promote sustainability within existing social structures, fostering comprehensive development. However, imbalanced power dynamics pose challenges, risking potential social exclusion. This chapter concludes by addressing practical implications and limitations, aiming to contribute to an ecologically balanced and socially equitable future by understanding entrepreneurship's role in promoting sustainability and green resilience within the context of power dynamics, ideologies, and social structures. © 2024 by Lukman Raimi.

AB  - South Asia faces a tremendous challenge in ensuring food security for its growing population. Poverty, climate change, and resource limitations threaten food production and access. Information and communication technology (ICT) provides a variety of techniques to increase food security. This research examines ICT’s effect on food security by regulating CO2 emissions, energy use, and economic growth in South Asian (SA) nations. It takes panel data from 1997 to 2021 and applies the 2nd generation unit root and Westerlund cointegration tests. For this reason, it is necessary to use 2nd generation Westerlund cointegration tests and the “Dumitrescu-Hurlin (D-H) causality test” to ensure the validity of the “Second-generation estimation technique(s) the Driscoll and Kraay method.” The outcomes of the bootstrap cointegration test support the existence of long-run cointegration. The Driscoll and Kraay results show a symmetric relationship between ICT and food security, linked to higher CO2 emissions, whereas economic growth and renewable energy consumption increase the latter. As a result of the significant positive stimulus it has on food security, developing ICT is vital to raising food security in South Asian countries. The results from the Driscoll and Kraay estimates are consistent with those from the GLS, proving the Driscoll and Kraay results are reliable. The D-H causality also confirms the GLS and Driscoll and Kraay results. To enhance environmental quality and food security, governments can fund green ICT R&D. Policymakers consider financial incentives such as tax breaks, grants, and subsidies to incentivize ICT companies to adopt sustainable practices and technology. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - There is extensive literature that defines eco-efficiency as the efficiency with which ecological resources are used to satisfy human needs. It ensures production while consuming fewer natural resources and thus reduces the environmental impact. The aim of this work is to fill the gap in the literature by defining eco-efficiency in terms of production and deaths due to pollution. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist Index (MI) are used for this purpose. Both techniques are applied to 20 European countries during the period 2014–2018. In addition, the spatial dependence of eco-efficiency obtained in the DEA analysis is studied using geostatistical techniques. The results reveal the good performance of almost all European countries, which are conditioned neither by their wealth nor by their economic growth. Eastern European countries show the most room for improvement. Finally, the spatial dependence of eco-efficiency in Europe during the period 2014–2018 was confirmed by detecting a significant cluster of low eco-efficiency countries in Eastern Europe. Researchers and policymakers can benefit from the results to provide country-specific investment policies to achieve higher benefits towards eco-efficiency in Europe. © 2022

AB  - Tropical tuber crops such as cassava, sweet potatoes and elephant foot yam play vital roles in global food security and economic development, particularly in deve-loping nations. The present study examines the current scenario of tuber crop production and trade dynamics, focusing on India's role both as a producer and an ex-porter. Using empirical data from various sources includ-ing Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, the study analyses production trends, trade patterns and policy frame-works, to elucidate potential pathways for enhancing productivity, sustainability and competitiveness in the tuber crops sector. The analysis reveals significant growth in cassava and sweet potato production globally, with India emerging as a key player. However, climate change, pests and diseases, soil degradation, and trade barriers pose hurdles to the growth of the sector. This study also recommends comprehensive strategies, includ-ing climate-resilient agricultural practices, integrated pest management, soil health enhancement and infra-structure development, to address these challenges and promote the sustainable growth of tuber crops. © (2024), (Indian Academy of Sciences).

AB  - The impact of digitization in the context of globalization on the formation and preservation of social capital, natural resources, and the environment has been considered. In examining state strategies towards digitization and its influence on social capital, principles such as specificity, integrity, historicism, and rationality were employed, along with methods of comparison and constructive criticism, as well as categories of essence, necessity, and measure. Historical, anthropological, ontological, political, axiological, and dialectical methods played a significant role in reflecting the characteristics of the information age, defining strategies, and priorities for the development of states and social capital. Countries that vigorously integrate digitization into human existence tend to develop faster, reap economic benefits, thereby contributing to the preservation of social capital. Additionally, the processes of digitization become essential for creating a digital space for the formation of digital social capital and the digital individual, each possessing unique characteristics. The digitization of social capital processes entails the introduction of digital technologies into the ontological environment of individuals, where they become part of human reality. Both positive and negative aspects of digitization have been identified, with the impact of digitization on social capital formation being complex and multifaceted, depending on the state’s development strategy in this direction. Digital technologies facilitate communication, increase access to information and resources, promoting the development of social connections and cooperation, ultimately enabling quick responses to environmental challenges for the preservation of the environment. Digitization is one of the characteristics of a society of sustainable development. Within the concept of this society, it allows accumulating social capital, developing the economy, taking into account environmental requirements. From a practical point of view, digitalization is a condition for structural changes in organizations, as a result of which the processes of internal and external communication and management change. The development of a digitalized society, in which the accumulation of social capital takes place, has a positive effect on the implementation of the principles of sustainable development: the combination of nature conservation and social development; satisfaction of basic human needs; achieving equality and social justice; ensuring social self-determination and cultural diversity; maintaining the integrity of ecosystems. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - Agroecosystems are vital for supplying ecosystem services to human society, but most modern farming practices impact detrimentally on the environment. Public agricultural support policies have been critically important in influencing the transformation of the farm sectors; however, few of them have been dedicated to enhancing ecosystem services beyond agricultural commodities. The largest agricultural support system worldwide, the European common agricultural policy (CAP), has now come to a critical point, as major decisions concerning its design and implementation after 2013 are about to be taken. The debate on this reform process presents a unique opportunity to trigger a transition from commodity-based subsidy policies to policies centered on efficient provision of ecosystem services from agricultural land. To prompt such discussion, we formulate key recommendations informed by a review of ecosystem services literature and address verifiable links to human well-being, nonmarket valuation for balanced services provision, treatment of ecosystem services bundles, site-specific and regionalized approaches, matching spatial scales for different ecosystem services, funding permanence for payment schemes, strong monitoring and adaptive approaches to tackling uncertainties, and coherent cross-sectoral policy design. If these issues were to be considered in formulating and implementing future CAP, it might become an exemplar for redirecting agricultural policies elsewhere in the world toward sustainability. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The challenge of this century is without a doubt to counter global warming. Land management, agriculture, and forests are responsible for 23% of total greenhouse gases (GHGs). In developing countries, such as those in African territories, where economic capacities are sometimes small and socio-cultural and linguistic perceptions are different, this requires a transition that is just and respectful of local culture and language, while at the same time helping to create labor conditions that respect gender and minors. This article describes a socio-technical ecological transition in the cocoa chain production in Côte d’Ivoire, which is not only the world’s leading producer of cocoa beans (45%) but also one of the African countries most prone to deforestation. Linguistic and multicultural aspects come together in Côte d’Ivoire, where more than 70 local languages are spoken. Intelligent digital approaches, agroecological issues, new methods, and sociocultural questions are embedded in a context of collaboration and co-creation, a living lab approach, to ensures sharing and co-creation among NGOs, farmers, companies, and researchers. A framework of socio-technical transition is presented, and this research aims to not only achieve the goals of a just ecological transition and reduce carbon footprint and deforestations but also to create diverse labour conditions, gender respect and inclusion. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The European Green Deal (EGD), launched by the European Commission in December 2019, is a major policy package addressing climate change and aiming at a “just and inclusive” transition. Several shortcomings can be identified in the EGD: it lacks a vision of a just, post-carbon economy for Europe; available resources are inadequate to reach stated objectives; and implementation tools are limited. We argue that making Europe’s production systems carbon neutral would require a broader range of “green” industrial policies that need to jointly address environmental sustainability, structural change, and fairness of economic outcomes in Europe. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Climate change, food security, and environmental sustainability are pressing issues faced by today’s global population. As production demands increase and climate threatens crop productivity, agricultural research develops innovative technologies to meet these challenges. Strategies include biodiverse cropping arrangements, new crop introductions, and genetic modification of crop varieties that are resilient to climatic and environmental stressors. Geography in particular is equipped to address a critical question in this pursuit—when and where can crop system innovations be introduced? This manuscript presents a case study of the geographic scaling potential utilizing common bean, delivers an open access Google Earth Engine geovisualization application for mapping the fundamental climate niche of any crop, and discusses food security and legume biodiversity in Sub-Saharan Africa. The application is temporally agile, allowing variable growing season selections and the production of ‘living maps’ that are continually producible as new data become available. This is an essential communication tool for the future, as practitioners can evaluate the potential geographic range for newly-developed, experimental, and underrepresented crop varieties for facilitating sustainable and innovative agroecological solutions. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Chapter 1 introduces the phenomenon of the bioeconomy, primarily through the economic and social context. The introductory theme is embedded in the history of economic thought, where concerns about the exploitation of resources and capital have existed since the beginnings of the science. For centuries, however, they have remained on the periphery of economics. The facts regarding the overshoot of planetary boundaries and unmet social needs in the current economic paradigm prove the need to change the approach to production and consumption. The circular bioeconomy is part of the answer to the above problems. Its importance stems from the assumptions of sustainable development. The second part of the chapter discusses the sources and concept of the bioeconomy and defines the context in which the bioeconomy is understood in this book. The final parts of the chapter deal with the economic and social conditions of the functioning of the bioeconomy, including the potential global risks associated with its unsustainable development in a global sense and its situation in the European Union. The potential of the bioeconomy and the emerging differences between countries are presented. The last part of the chapter deals with the aspect of financing sustainable development with a special focus on the bioeconomy. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Małgorzata Pink and Agnieszka Józefowska; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Climate change could have far-reaching effects on agriculture, trade patterns, development and food security. This article examines quantitatively the impact of climate change on food production and numbers at risk of hunger, allowing for factors such as latitude and farming practice. Globally, a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) level may lead to a small to moderate decrease in food production, but developing countries would bear the brunt of the consequences. To prevent widespread hunger, the agricultural industry should develop management programmes for hot and dry conditions, in conjunction with measures to slow the growth of the human population and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article aims to advance understandings of food systems functioning at a national level and explore ways for its transformation towards sustainability and social justice. Integrating food regime theory from political economy with social metabolism from ecological economics, and surplus/reproduction from feminist economics, we develop a novel research framework which combines six dimensions—food systems governance, monetary agrifood chain, socio-metabolic agrifood chain, surplus/reproduction, socioecological impacts, and conflicts & levers of change—encompassing 34 elements linked through six key connections. The research framework highlights the role of cheap food for the social reproduction of the labouring population in capitalism. Since national states play important roles in maintaining food regimes, we conducted a critical literature review through which we identified the main contributions and limitations of studies of food regimes at the national level aimed at foreseeing exit ways beyond the current corporate food regime. This regime is one of the main drives of the overcoming of planetary boundaries. An agroecological transition and food system change is needed to address this socio-ecological crisis, and this requires new food polices at a national level as well. This is why we consider it essential to integrate social metabolism with the approaches of food regimes and surplus/reproduction. © 2024

AB  - Currently, trade enables regions to have a higher provisioning ecosystem services (ES) demand than that provided by ecosystems in the same region. This practice leads to a supply and demand provisioning ES scale mismatch, which may affect the provision of other ES. To address such an issue from the sub-national scale, an ES approach implementation step to provide realistic, context-specific pathways toward sustainability is necessary. This paper provides a detailed quantitative assessment of ecosystem services over time in Biscay, Basque Country, Spain. The aim is to identify ways of balancing the local provisioning ecosystem service supply and demand and to enhance sustainable land use. We studied the ecological footprint evolution of the province for 11 years and its relation to ecosystem services. We determined that the replacement of the current forest plantations' monocultures to a multifunctional landscape reinforces food security and enhances biodiversity and essential ES. This place-based ecosystem services assessment, which integrates ecological footprint calculations into an ecosystem service framework, demonstrated that provisioning ES-scale mismatches may be confronted locally by implementing sustainable landscape management strategies, including actions focusing on the supply and demand of ES. The current globalised economy promotes a global reduction in ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services. Reducing the ecological footprint at the local scale would contribute to the reduction of provisioning ecosystem services' demand at the global scale. Thus, maximising a mosaic approach to land use locally would help improve the provision of ecosystem services and therefore also contribute to the global footprint reduction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Horticultural products, like all food products, are currently faced with three challenges concerning sustainable development. The first is to protect the environment The second challenge regards nutrition and health. Variety, transport conditions (temperature and duration), the type of technology used in processing (cold break, hot break) and the conditions of use of the final product are highly responsible for nutrient loss. The third challenge is the economic and social impact. Every segment of the food chains must guarantee an improvement in human wellbeing and social justice. Furthermore, consumers have changed and have replaced the traditional price-quality criteria used in making choices. They require information on environmental, nutritional and social aspects of the whole production and distribution systems Like all other products, industrial tomatoes must mirror these new market requirements and customer demands. Professionals are unable to cope with all three challenges simultaneously. With this in mind, an on-going national research programme in France (FLONUDEP) is aiming to create a decision-making tool adapted to this new context for the impact of both fresh and processed tomato production chains. A life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology has been applied to all stages of the product's life cycle, from the extraction of raw ingredient to the production system, processing, commercialisation, consumption and end of life, taking into account environmental, nutritional, economic and social considerations. Three countries have been studied: France, Turkey and Morocco. Results show considerable differences among the 3 countries, not only in terms of values, but also in terms of the most polluting stage across the LCA (whether agriculture, logistics, factory etc.). However, in general, the production methods, the organization of logistics circuits, and the choice of packaging seem to be crucial to environmental impact. In nutritional terms, product processing times are essential as is the ambient temperature which can alter nutrients. Logistics are therefore fundamental. Consumers must also modify their behaviour with regard to conserving products.

AB  - Sustainable development and climate change mitigation have become guiding policy principles in many welfare states. However, the traditional role of a welfare state is to guarantee the economic stability, jobs and welfare for its citizens. Sustainable development leans on the idea that we can have economic, social and environmental sustainability at the same time. This would require decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. Decoupling should be studied globally, because within nations, the economy can grow while local environmental impacts decrease, but at the same time, global environmental impacts may increase due to international trade. In this study, we examine the consumption-based carbon and material footprints of a Nordic welfare state, Finland. We focus on the environmental impacts of public spending, which has received little attention previously. In welfare states, the reallocation of public funds to services and individuals are at its core. In the study, we examine how this affects the carbon and material footprints of various income groups and household types. We find that the share of public services and investments is 19% of the carbon footprint and 38% of the material footprint per capita. Building of infrastructure plays a major role in composing the material footprint. We also find that the welfare state has important features that improve the carbon equity between the citizens. To achieve absolute decoupling, required to reduce environmental impacts caused by economic activities, we suggest policies promoting public and private green investments. In addition, increased carbon pricing would enhance green investments and drive environmental innovation. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Wheat provides about 19% of the food calories and 21% of the protein to the world population. In 2008, the total wheat area grownwas about 224 million ha and with a harvest of 690 million t of grain.The Green Revolution in wheat production, spawned by the development of short-stature, photoperiod-insensitive, high yielding wheat cultivars with host plant resistance to rusts and other pathogens, was able to increase wheat productivity at a 3.6% annual rate in the 1960s and 1970s. However, yield growth in wheat slip to 2.8% from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, and to 1.1% since the mid-1990s. In the period leading up to 2020, demand for wheat for human consumption in developing countries is expected to grow at 1.6 % per annum, and for feed at 2.6 % per annum. The global average of wheat yield will have therefore to increase in the coming years at least to 3.5 t ha-1. This yield increase, essential to maintain global food security, requires a continuing supply of improved germplasm and appropriate agronomy in order to sustain enhanced productivity and preserve the natural resource base of the wheat farming. Global warming, as a result of climate change, may negatively affect wheat grain yields -potentially increasing food insecurity and poverty. Wheat breeders will depend on the croṕs genetic diversity and modern genetic enhancement methods (both genomics and transgenics) for improving wheat yield and its stability. They should conservewheat germplasm, study it, add value to it, and share it in enhanced form with clients worldwide. While changes in plant architecture (dwarfism and harvest index), photoperiod response and breeding for host plant resistance (especially for rusts) led to the productivity gains of the Green Revolution, adaptation to climate change (water and heat stresses, emerging pathogens and pests), efficient input use, food safety and quality, are additional global challenges to be tackled to fit newly bred-genotypes into sustainable and improved wheat farming in this 21st Century. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This article discusses how by voluntarily adopting new dimensions of corporate responsibility-for the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by its products-global retailers not only position their organizations as responsible in the battle to win the hearts, minds, and wallets of their consumers, but also articulate a new solution for the mitigation of climate change aligned with their commercial interests. As part of this solution, retailers (and other brands) reimagined how GHG emissions should be allocated-shifting from a productionist-based to a consumptionist-based perspective-and redefined what they are responsible for and what their supply chains must care about. The article argues that the complexity involved in engaging tens, hundreds, or even thousands of individual organizations across numerous products' supply chains means that requirements to measure and reduce a product's carbon footprint cannot, and are not, simply pushed down a supply chain. Rather through a confluence of the practices of translation, observation, and normalization retailers are creating, fostering, and articulating new regimes of responsibilization within which actors across successive tiers of a product's supply chains must measure, monitor, and reduce their own carbon footprints independently, conscientiously, and diligently, thereby enabling retailers to achieve carbon reductions at a distance. Seen through the Foucauldian-inspired lens of the technologies of the self and self-government under neoliberal governance regimes, this article suggests that, through the control of what is in a product's carbon footprint, how this should be measured, and how it should be reduced-what are called here carbon truths-global retailers are working to consolidate their socioeconomic powers as sustainability leaders that fundamentally direct society's response to, and mitigation of, climate change. © 2015 Clark University.

AB  - The concept of regenerative agriculture has received increasing attention worldwide as a method to restore and conserve natural resources while maintaining crop productivity. However, there remains a lack of consensus as to what conditions define regenerative agriculture, making it difficult for decision-makers, researchers, the agricultural sector, and the public to adopt regenerative agri culture practices. Here, we present the initial process to create a unified, cross-sectoral definition for regenerative agriculture in India that considers the viewpoints of multiple stakeholders and addresses the current challenges faced by the Indian agricultural sector. To this end, we compiled interactions with individuals from across India to identify the most pressing concerns for India’s human and environmental ecosystems. We conducted over 30 hours of workshops to discuss these concerns with 50 experts from five sectors and four countries. We summarize these discussions and propose a common framework to collaboratively develop region-specific techniques that employ existing and supplementary resources to generate evidence for regenerative agriculture and foster conducive practices. © Olsson, Ameen, Bajpai, Gudasalamani, Gajjar, Gupta, Hvilshøj, Krishnakumar, Lobo, Mukerjee, Naik, Raghavan, Singh and Subaharan 2022.

AB  - Aquaculture is one of the fisheries sub-sectors that play a strategic role in national development. Currently, the aquaculture sector contributes significantly to both food security and national economic growth. This study aims to analyze the performance of aquaculture in 6 major islands located in Indonesia at the period of 2010 to 2018. The research was carried out with quantitative and qualitative approaches using descriptive analysis, taking into account economic and social aspects. Economic aspects were measured by five variable indicators, namely Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and aquaculture production volume, budget value, aquaculture land area and the number of fish farmer households. Social aspects were measured based on five variables of fish cultivator exchange rate (NTPi), budget value, price index received by fish cultivation, household consumption index, production cost index. The results showed that the contribution of aquaculture was fairly significant toward the achievement of national development goals, although not all indicators were able to achieve the set targets. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This study contributes to the Sustainable Development Goal 15 by examining the dynamics of balancing the ecological footprint and meeting fundamental human needs in terms of food and shelter. The analysis utilizes a panel dataset comprising 9 countries with ecological deficits, covering the period from 1971 to 2022. The estimators employed in the study are robust to cross-sectional dependence and allow for heterogeneous slope coefficients. The findings, based on the FE-DK and MMQR models, provide empirical evidence supporting the ecological deficit hypothesis. The validity of the ecological deficit hypothesis is verified by the inverted U-shaped nexus between economic growth and ecological deficits. Finance plays a mitigating role in reducing the ecological deficit for food, but it is associated with higher levels of deficit for shelter, particularly at the upper quantile. Trade openness exacerbates the ecological deficit for food, but it helps reduce the deficit for shelter. Robustness analysis, conducted using the half-panel jackknife multivariate Wald-type test, confirms that the covariates exhibit Granger-causal relationships with the ecological deficit. Bidirectional causal relationships are observed between the ecological deficit for food and squared economic growth. Additionally, bidirectional relationships exist between trade and urban population and the ecological footprint for shelter. The findings offer useful insights for policymakers and stakeholders that are working towards achieving sustainable development. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) activities continue to grow in many resource-endowed countries with ASM-generated revenues serving as a precursor to socio-economic growth especially in mineral-rich rural communities. However, the rapid proliferation of this extractive activity into new frontiers often extends to territories where, traditionally, agricultural activities may already be present. Considering the destructive effects of the ASM life cycle on the environment, concerns have been raised regarding the negative agricultural impacts of ASM. Thus in this paper, we review the Janus-faced nature of ASM as discourses have developed in the burgeoning literature. Our review reveals an emerging narrative suggesting that in some instances ASM and agriculture complement each other with beneficial consequences. Nevertheless, this highly informal type of mining can have deleterious effects on agriculture through three main mechanisms: land degradation and farm invasions, water and mercury pollution, and the Dutch disease phenomenon – the shift of labour from the agriculture sector to the ASM sector. As most of the operations of small-scale mineral extractors take place in rural communities where agriculture is the main source of livelihood, we find the creation of vulnerabilities in the agrarian economy through these mechanisms. Considering the economic importance of the two sectors to livelihoods, stakeholders would need to recast resources policy to ensure the proper accommodation of both sectors especially in the rural economic space. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The status of green marketing implementation and achievements in Africa point to a bleak future. There is general consensus in extant literature that the African continent is lagging behind in attaining environmental sustainability targets (Asongu & Odhiambo, 2021; Aluko et al., 2023). Empirical evidence also suggests that the African continent is warming more rapidly as compared to other continents (Avom et al., 2020; Aluko et al., 2023). This, according to Avom et al. (2020), is manifested by the escalation of climate change-induced grand problems such as droughts, floods, poverty, forced migration, health pandemics and social inequalities. Moreover, the growing rate of unemployment characterised by de-industrialisation and rapid informalisation of African economies is at odds with the green marketing promise of green economic growth (Asongu & Odhiambo, 2021). This further raises doubt about the potential of green marketing as a driver of economy growth in Africa. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - In today's world, agriculture is not only about food production but also a critical factor in global environmental change, economic stability, and human health, among other aspects. With population growth and increasingly scarce resources, exploring sustainable development of food systems has become crucial. Achieving this goal requires striking a delicate balance among food security, economic development, ecological environment, and human health. Traditional approaches to sustainable agricultural development research often focus solely on singular domains, overlooking the inherent connections and interactions among environmental, socioeconomic, and health dimensions. This perspective limits our comprehensive understanding of food systems. Environmental footprint assessments can be integrated with economic, systemic, and decision models to analyze environmental, socioeconomic, and health issues within food systems. This integration accurately captures the diversity, overlap, accumulation, and heterogeneity of environmental pressures resulting from human and natural factors. Therefore, we propose an innovative conceptual framework that considers environmental, socioeconomic, and health dimensions as crucial components, with the environmental footprint indicators at its core, to link various stages from farm to table. This framework constructs an evidence gap map, integrating dispersed data and perspectives from existing literature, thus showing knowledge gaps across these domains. Such an interdisciplinary approach not only provides a more comprehensive perspective on the multidimensional complexity of sustainable food systems but also reveals potential synergies and conflicts among environmental, socioeconomic, and health domains, thereby guiding more comprehensive and cautious policy-making. Importantly, it provides direction for future research to achieve the sustainable development of food systems, emphasizing the necessity of a comprehensive, integrated research perspective, particularly in strengthening studies on composited footprints, viewing the entire farm-to-table continuum holistically. Stakeholders must collaborate and coordinate environmental, socioeconomic, and health objectives to drive the sustainable development of food systems. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: The original principles of the hierarchy of resource use seem to have been forgotten. The purpose of this paper is to address the necessity of these principles in order for a circular economy (CE) to be sustainable. Design/methodology/approach: This is a general review paper explaining today’s shortcomings in a CE and in the waste hierarchy. Its theoretical contribution is illustrated using the example of marine plastic waste in the Arctic, as well as the EU’s action plan for a CE: “Closing the loop”. Findings: There is a need to reduce raw materials into the economy directly and not only as a potential result of recycling. This is supported theoretically and by illustrating that the EU’s action plan is closing the loop primarily from the output side. Research limitations/implications: The theoretical possibility of complete recycling rests on a premise that is now at odds with a sustainable development. Social implications: The power of existing raw material production cycles must be challenged to allow reduction to be a real option. If not, a CE may exacerbate a moral trade-off by the current generation reducing the safe operating space of future living beings. Originality/value: The theoretical possibility of recycling everything, also known as the technology-optimist view, has played the role of a safety net for humanity. As we are now exceeding planetary boundaries for a safe and just space for humanity, this theoretical safety net is no longer valid. Instead, we must reinforce the basic principles of the hierarchy of resource use. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Food production depends upon the adequate provision of underpinning ecosystem services, such as pollination. Paradoxically, conventional farming practices are undermining these services and resulting in degraded soils, polluted waters, greenhouse gas emissions and massive loss of biodiversity including declines in pollinators. In essence, farming is undermining the ecosystem services it relies upon. Finding alternative more sustainable ways to meet growing food demands which simultaneously support biodiversity is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. Here, we review the potential of urban and peri-urban agriculture to contribute to sustainable food production, using the 17 sustainable development goals set by the United Nations General Assembly as a framework. We present new data from a case study of urban gardens and allotments in the city of Brighton and Hove, UK. Such urban and peri-urban landholdings tend to be small and labour-intensive, characterised by a high diversity of crops including perennials and annuals. Our data demonstrate that this type of agricultural system can be highly productive and that it has environmental and social advantages over industrial agriculture in that crops are usually produced using few synthetic inputs and are destined for local consumption. Overall, we conclude that food grown on small-scale areas in and near cities is making a significant contribution to feeding the world and that this type of agriculture is likely to be relatively favourable for some ecosystem services, such as supporting healthy soils. However, major knowledge gaps remain, for example with regard to productivity, economic and employment impacts, pesticide use and the implications for biodiversity. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Degradation of natural resources is a threat to sustainable development in many developing countries. Solving this requires an understanding of the factors affecting the extraction of and the dependence on the resources as well as the impacts on rural welfare. In this study, we identify the factors affecting the extraction of and the dependence on forest and water resources and examine the impacts of the extraction on rural household welfare in Laos. We address our research questions with an econometric framework that models the extraction and its implications simultaneously. We use the data of 430 rural households from a survey undertaken in 2013 in 38 villages of Savannakhet Province. Our findings show that extracting forest and water resources is a shock-coping strategy of rural households but contributes to reducing household income inequality. For extracting households, the extraction increases household income, consumption, and food security. However, for nonextracting households, although participating in the extraction would increase food security, it would reduce their income and consumption. We suggest that promoting rural education and off-farm employment opportunities and enhancing investments in physical infrastructures would reduce the extraction of and the dependence on the resources of extractors and prevent nonextractors from being forced to extract the resources. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study relates agricultural income and agricultural carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the context of environmental Kuznets curves for South Africa. We posit likely relationships between UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 1, 2 and 13, relating food production to climate change action. CO2 emissions, income, coal energy consumption and electricity energy consumption time series data from 1990 to 2012 within the South African agricultural sector were used. The autoregressive distributive lag bounds-test and the error correction model were used to analyse the data. The results show long-run relationships. However, agricultural income was only significant in the linear and squared models. Changes in agricultural CO2 emissions from the short run towards the long run are estimated at 71.9%, 124.7% and 125.3% every year by the linear, squared and cubic models, respectively. Exponentially increasing agricultural income did not result in a decrease in agricultural CO2 emissions, which is at odds with the Kuznets hypothesis. The study concludes that it will be difficult for South Africa to simultaneously achieve SDGs 1, 2 and 13, especially given that agriculture is reliant upon livestock production, the largest CO2 emitter in the sector. The sector needs to shift to renewable energy consumption with fewer CO2 emissions. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - A new financing mechanism known as REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) is being established to achieve large-scale reductions in GHG emissions from tropical forestry and land use. Can REDD+ successfully integrate an emphasis on sustainable development benefits (as with Official Development Assistance, ODA) with a focus on delivering emission reductions (as with the Clean Development Mechanism, CDM)? It is argued that there is a real risk that REDD+ will stay too close to ODA and fail to move beyond its 'readiness' phase. Moreover, as with the CDM, there could be an over-emphasis on results in terms of emission reductions, which would only make it attractive for a small set of activities in relatively few countries. In order to balance sustainable development with cost-effective emission reductions, REDD+ needs to involve the private sector in project implementation and financing, its rules for reference levels and crediting arrangements need to be flexible, and forest countries need to proactively direct activities.Policy relevance REDD+ has the potential to deliver funding at an unprecedented scale for forestry and land use activities in developing countries. However, this will only occur if the mechanism can successfully transition from its current readiness phase (which is similar to ODA) to a results-based REDD+phase (which implies similarities with the CDM). A framework for analysing the attractiveness of results-based REDD+ for both forest and funder countries is provided. It is argued that the interests of forest and funder countries coincide when there are activities that score well with respect to financing and co-funding requirements, socio-economic impacts, and governance implications, within the context of each forest country's policy environment and capabilities. An early case study of a results-based REDD+ transaction, the Indonesian logging moratorium, suggests this conceptual framework provides an effective decision support tool to help design future REDD+ policy interventions to avoid the various pitfalls of ODA and the CDM. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Fair pricing used to refer to the problem of the buyer’s judgement of a seller’s price decision. Nowadays, when sustainability becomes a vital and fundamental consideration of tourism development, fair pricing should be discussed in a much wider context. The ethical context of fair pricing in tourism should be emphasised, as it is recognised as one of the transparent and ethical practices of tourism enterprises. In consequence, fair pricing is a significant element of corporate social responsibility and supports other goals like the beneficial partnerships of tourism enterprises with local communities and suppliers, providing equal opportunities and remuneration for the employees of tourism enterprises, as well as increasing the sustainable treatment of scarce natural resources. Fair pricing relates not only to the judgement of tourists (price versus value), but also to the opinion of the employees of tourism enterprises (price related to salaries), suppliers (price of finished product related to prices of raw materials and services), local communities (price versus income), and other stakeholders dependant on tourism industry in different ways. Finally, fair pricing must solve the issue of so-called “cheap nature”. This means that fair pricing relates to a valuation of ecosystem services, as tourism “consumes” environmental assets and significantly influences the cultural landscape. In consequence, fair pricing might contribute to the protection of bio-and geodiversity, climate, and cultural landscape. The aim of the chapter is to: (1) define fair pricing and discuss the evolutionary changes of the definition; (2) highlight the emerging importance of fair pricing in tourism; (3) review the theoretical concepts, empirical results, and practical applications of fair pricing; and (4) discuss the contribution of fair pricing to achieving sustainable development goals for tourism. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Alastair M.

AB  - The Middle East and North African (MENA) countries are subject to natural and anthropogenic stressors that inhibit environmental conservation, economic development and social stability, creating a potential for socio-economic disparities between them. The current parochialistic approach adopted by majority of the MENA countries continues to foster competition, despite the complementary relationships that can potentially arise between their resource systems. Consequently, food security is one area which is vastly suffering at unprecedented scales threatening the prosperity in the MENA region. On the other hand, the MENA countries share similar socio-economic and geo-political characteristics, and therein lies an opportunity to create a novel strategic ecosystem for enhancing cooperation between them to achieve greater resilience in regional food security. In this paper, the tools used to model competition and the enabling mechanisms for cooperative approaches were reviewed, including applications of non-cooperative and cooperative game theory in EWF nexus systems. A real-life example of the usefulness of game theoretic models is illustrated through a transboundary EWF nexus-based cooperative framework which links the available resources and assets in the MENA region and offers a fertile field to enhance food security and greater socio-economic and environmental resilience in the region. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Hundreds of millions of people are now facing food insecurity as challenges from climate change, the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and strife and conflicts make availability of food at reasonable prices challenging. International trade has enabled the reallocation of agricultural products, essential for nutrition, from countries with supply markets to other points of demand and has been the subject of an increasing number of policy interventions by governments. In this paper, a multicommodity international trade network equilibrium model is constructed with the inclusion of nutritional minimal standards to support food security, accompanied by consumer subsidies, for which explicit formulae are provided. The theoretical and computational framework is based on variational inequalities. Numerical examples focusing on Ukraine and MENA (Middle Eastern and North African) countries and a staple commodity of wheat demonstrate the modeling and policy framework. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Equity issues have long been debated within international climate politics, focused on fairly distributing reductions in territorial emissions and fossil fuel consumption. There is a growing recognition among scholars and policymakers that curbing fossil fuel supply (as well as demand) can be a valuable part of the climate policy toolbox; this raises the question of where and how the tool should be applied. This paper explores how to equitably manage the social dimensions of a rapid transition away from fossil fuel extraction. Fossil fuel extraction leads to benefits for some people (such as extraction workers) and harms for others (such as pollution-affected communities). A transition must respect and uphold the rights of both groups, while also staying within climate limits, as climate impacts will fall most heavily on the world’s poor. This paper begins by reviewing how extraction affects economies and communities and the different transitional challenges they face. Based on that review, it then examines three common equity approaches–economic efficiency, meeting development needs, and effort-sharing. Drawing lessons from the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, the paper proposes five principles as a basis for equitably curbing fossil fuel extraction within climate limits: (1) Phase out global extraction at pace consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C; (2) Enable a just transition for workers and communities; (3) Curb extraction consistent with environmental justice; (4) Reduce extraction fastest where doing so will have the least social costs; (5) Share transition costs fairly, according to ability to bear those costs. Key policy insights: Fossil fuel extraction is unlikely to be a viable path to development because the Paris Agreement goals require most fossil fuel use to be ended within a generation; Extraction should be phased out fastest in diversified, wealthier economies that can better absorb the transitional impacts; Governments of extracting countries should enact ambitious industrial policy to diversify their economies, alongside economic and employment policies to enable a just transition; The costs of a just transition should be borne by those most able to bear it: poorer countries can reasonably demand financial support. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Environment degradation and augmentation of poverty are causing a serious peril not only for the present but also for future generations. The situation is aggravated day by day. This is mainly due to the distortion in the market systems. Environmental Fiscal Reform (EFR), through decentralisation measures, can rationalise tax arrangement and distribute resources effectively and efficiently. The devolution of power is a step forward, but it requires corresponding fiscal decentralisation, institutional development, and political will. The lower tiers of government have meagre resources and poor skills, infrastructure, and institutions, which need improvement. EFR can generate benefits in terms of fiscal revenue, environmental outcomes, and poverty reduction in local districts. It can also produce greater opportunities for empowering and serving the poorest people, and, as a result, also support sustainable development. © The Pakistan Development Review.

AB  - Since the late 20th century, there has been an increasing focus on the impact of climate change on various sectors, including agriculture. Consequently, it is crucial to assess how the negative effects of climate change can be mitigated to ensure food security. This study evaluated the relationship between agriculture, food security, and CO2 emissions. In particular, a correlation analysis was conducted between selected indicators for three countries: Kazakhstan, the United States of America, and Germany, as a representative of European Union countries. The study demonstrated that rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and the increased frequency of extreme weather events significantly disrupt agricultural productivity, posing substantial risks to global food security. These issues were compounded by the need to adapt agricultural methods and technologies to new climatic realities, which often require significant financial and human resources, particularly in developing countries with limited resources. Conclusions drawn from statistical data revealed mixed results: for Kazakhstan, the positive impact of agriculture on food security was confirmed, while CO2 emissions had an ambiguous effect on food security indicators. The findings of this study can be used to inform strategies for future development, both by enterprises and by the state as a whole. Copyright © The Author(s).

AB  - The improvement and application of pest models to predict yield losses is still a challenge for the scientific community. However, pest models were targeted chiefly towards scheduling scouting or pesticide applications to deal with pest infestation. Thysanoptera (thrips) significantly impact the productivity of many economically important crops worldwide. Until now, no comprehensive study is available on the global distribution of pest thrips, as well as on the extent of cropland vulnerability worldwide. Further, nothing is known about the climate change impacts on these insects. Thus the present study was designed to map the global distribution and quantify the extent of cropland vulnerability in the present and future climate scenarios using data of identified pest thrips within the genus, i.e., Thrips, Frankliniella, and Scirtothrips. Our found significant niche contraction under the climate change scenarios and thrips may reside primarily in their thermal tolerance thresholds. About 3,98,160 km2 of cropland globally was found to be affected in the present scenario. However, it may significantly reduce to 5530 Km2 by 2050 and 1990 km2 by 2070. Further, the thrips distribution mostly getting restricted to Eastern North America, the North-western of the Indian sub-continent, and the north of Europe. Among all realms, thrips may lose ground in the Indo-Malayan realm at the most and get restricted to only 27 out of 825 terrestrial ecoregions. The agrarian communities of the infested regions may get benefit if these pests get wiped out, but on the contrary, we may lose species diversity. Moreover, the vacated niche may attract other invasive species, which may seriously impact the species composition and agricultural productivity. The present study findings can be used in making informed decisions about prioritizing future economic and research investments on the thrips in light of anticipated climate change impacts. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This chapter explores the impacts that rapid growth in biofuel demand has on agricultural prices, the consumption levels of key staple commodities, and the resulting impacts on food security and nutrition. The results clearly show a “food-versus-fuel” tradeoff that any national plan for biofuel expansion should take into account. Intensified biofuel production would likely increase the number of malnourished people. Rapid biofuel expansion also has a significant impact on international trade, particularly the global trade balance of maize. In addition, the results indicate that expansion of biofuels would increase the stress on regional water supplies only marginally; however, a significant expansion of biofuel production in areas facing water scarcity could exacerbate the problem. Aside from food security concerns, the expansion of biofuels entails additional tradeoffs with environmental sustainability, and the goals of overall economic growth and poverty reduction. © 2010, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Cities are the largest structure humans build. An "ecocity" is an ecologically healthy city. Born from urban ecology and rooted in bioregionalism, the ecocity movement quest to evolve ecocities is three-fold: (i) reduce overall demand for energy and materials within a city through social innovation coupled with intelligent design, (ii) improve access to resources by all who need it, and (iii) re-generate natural habitat to secure local and global ecosystem integrity. This book represents the state of practice in ecocity development utilizing case studies from Africa, Asia, North and South America. The content revolves around a core theme of building socially just and ecologically sustainable cities and then drills into three sub-themes addressing: climate action, circular economy, and informal solutions for sustainable development. The chapters illustrate concepts from the Ecocity Standards, a diagnostic tool evolved from a holistic understanding of Earth's socio-ecological systems for maintaining homeostasis. Ecocity Standards help cities assess their progress on the path to becoming ecocities. The chapters provide an orientation to the importance of engaging people, where they live, in ecocity transformations as well as emerging opportunities for affordable and accessible technologies that build capacity for implementation of ecocity initiatives. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license.

AB  - Negotiations around Sustainable Development Goals and the post-2015 development agenda should go beyond just re-writing goals and targets that adhere to 'sustaining' the same old economic and social models. Instead, societies and governments should take this as an opportunity to advance more radical conceptual and practical approaches that challenge this reductive understanding of 'sustainability'. The paper argues that we should turn our attention to prosperity rather than to development per se, recognising the critical role political and social innovation should have in unleashing individuals' potential to flourishing in a context of finite resources. The interwoven, interdependent and ever-evolving nature of socio-ecological systems, together with the uncertainties and 'unknowns' that characterise contemporary reality, questions the relevance of one-size-fits-all goals. There is no single route to prosperity; diversity of objectives is essential and fundamental. Learning from initiatives in the Global South, such as the case of agroecology, might pave the way towards this paradigm shift. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This article examines the relationship of free trade with agriculture in view of agriculture's distinctive features in the following three ways. First, agriculture produces a wide array of local and national nonmarket goods and services (in addition to market commodities) collectively known as multifunctionality of agriculture. Second, agriculture is intimately associated with global public goods of grave importance to humanity such as climate change, sustainability, and food security (poverty/hunger) in developing countries that require transnational cooperation to minimize free-rider and consequent under-provision problems. Third, embodying the first and second problems, agriculture plays distinctively different roles across countries. Specifically, this article views the global agriculture as consisting of four broad groups of countries with widely divergent needs from agriculture. This article concludes that the above agriculture-related problems are too diverse and complex to be left to free trade. When the global community is too much preoccupied with the illusive mission of agricultural trade liberalization, the great danger is that such preoccupation may distract it from effectively addressing the agriculture-related problems of the 21st century in a timely manner that pose imperative challenges to humanity. The governance for global agriculture should prioritize managing/taming such global problems rather than squandering time for unworkable liberalization of agricultural trade. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cooperatives are considered as potential organizational vehicles for sustainable development due to their multiple objectives and diverse roles. In particular, a lot is expected from agricultural cooperatives since they depend mainly on natural resource-based activities where sustainability issues are central concerns. Using household survey data of 305 coffee farmers from Ethiopia, the impacts of cooperative membership on farmers social and environmental performances are examined. Findings, based on propensity scores matching, show a significant positive impact of cooperatives on members social capital including trust, commitment and satisfaction, and on human capital such as training sessions received and experiences gained. However, farmers environmental performance is negatively associated with membership contrary to expectations. The findings suggest further efforts that need to be made by agricultural cooperatives to improve the environmental performance of farmers, while the accumulated human and social capitals are encouraging and can ease future collective actions toward cares for the environment and future generations. © 2015 Taylor and Francis.

AB  - Diana Mitlin INTRODUCTION This chapter explores the impact of regulation and competition policy on the poor. There are a number of anticipated influences both in regard to the poor as consumers and as producers and/or suppliers of goods and services. Potential areas of influence include the impact of regulation and competition policies on the price of basic commodities and services; the quality of commodities and services; opportunities for access to markets for commodities and services; changes in market opportunities for employment and enterprise development (both positive and negative); and changes in externalities such as environmental degradation, and health and safety. Such areas have an evident impact on the well-being of the poor, their capacity to avoid poverty and their development options. The study focuses on a single sector, water services, and considers the impacts for the urban poor. Water was selected because it is a basic need in maintaining life and improving well-being in the short, medium and long term. For the poor, the objective is access to affordable and adequate supplies of water to meet a multitude of needs. The significance of politics and policy in influencing outcomes such as access and affordability is emphasised by Spiller and Savedoff (1999, pp. 1-2): why is it so difficult to properly manage and operate water systems in the region, and more generally in the developing world? The problem is not related to project finance or lack of technical or manpower capabilities, but rather to the political economy of the sector…. © Paul Cook, Colin Kirkpatrick, Martin Minogue, David Parker 2004.

AB  - Sustainability transitions are required to address challenges of climate change, economic development, ecological integrity, and social justice. Driving sustainability transitions is difficult but necessary work. We discuss sustainability challenges and the need for transitions, with a focus on the vital roles that change agents can play. These change agents exhibit a desire to make change happen. They encourage others to join them in their efforts. After discussing the work of change agents in driving sustainability transitions, we present a case study of change in Perth, Australia, where change agents have attained considerable success in placing that city on a path toward sustainable water management practices. We suggest sustainability transitions can be effectively enabled when change agents: (1) Clarify the problem and articulate a clear vision; (2) Engage others to identify workable solutions and implementation pathways; (3) Secure support from influential stakeholders; (4) Establish effective monitoring tools and learning systems; (5) Foster long-term relationships of trust and mutual support; and (6) Develop narratives that support on-going action. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Food security debates have only recently emerged in Australia with the prediction that Australia's population could reach 35 million by 2050. In a country with limited productive arable land and a heavy reliance on inputs, the question is raised: 'Can and should Australia continue to export food and feed itself in the face of changes in the use and ownership of agricultural land, tighter water regulations, increasing input costs, declining numbers of farmers and rural labour, environmental degradation and a changing climate?' This paper examines the relative importance of these changes, using current information and future scenarios. A brief introduction to Australian agriculture describes the current production and trade environment. Land use and social and environmental changes are then analysed in terms of their impact on the role and future productive capacity of Australian agriculture. We conclude that despite recent declines in farmer populations, available agricultural land and water restrictions, Australia will continue to produce enough food for domestic and export markets at least in the short term with import substitutions as required. Longer term food security for Australia and its trade partners is likely to be threatened by climate impacts (e.g. droughts, flooding and cyclones), lack of planning controls over urban development and mining on productive land, shortages of skilled labour and underinvestment in agricultural research and development. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Climate disruption today represents a threat to the environment and sustainable development. Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an appropriate adaptation approach to climate change. It allows producers to improve their production and act on their food security, despite the conditions of climate change while limiting the causes arising from agriculture. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of CSA, through the use of harvest residues in cassava fields, on the income and food security of cassava producing households in Savalou. The three-stage sampling method made it possible to draw a random sample of 360 cassava producers including 180 users of pigeon pea, mucuna and peanut harvest residues. The average income from cassava production during the last 12 months (until July 2023) is 366,400 FCFA with 387,340 FCFA for beneficiaries compared to 322,060 FCFA for non-beneficiaries. The impact analysis was done with the matching method based on propensity scores. The results of this impact study showed that this adoption contributes to improving income from cassava production by 35,135 FCFA and household food security by 0.10 points, on average per household per year. It would therefore be useful to promote and improve this type of agriculture, in order to ensure sustainable development of the agricultural sector and improve food security. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Tunisia is characterized by water scarcity, growing water demand and considerable waste of this resource especially in the agricultural sector. To cope with this situation and enhance water productivity, appropriate utilization of advanced irrigation methods such as drip irrigation is highly needed. Hence, this research aims to evaluate the profitability of drip irrigation systems compared with surface irrigation systems at the perimeter of Echraf, which is located in the northeastern of Tunisia. Primary data were collected from 25 adopters of the Drip Irrigation System and 13 non-adopters. The results of the partial budget analysis revealed that the average total cost for adopters was higher than that for non-adopters. However, the net margin was higher for adopters than for non-adopters. This is due to the greater increase in gross revenue for adopters than for non-adopters. Additionally, drip irrigation resulted in more efficient water use and water values than did the surface irrigation system. Economic profitability analysis via the benefit cost ratio and net present value tools revealed that the drip irrigation system is profitable. The benefit cost ratio is equal to 1.65, and the net present value is approximately 2938 Tunisian National Dinar. Finally, the sensitivity analysis reveals the extent to which profitability is sensitive to the scenarios of subsidy levels. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The Zapatosa Marsh Complex (ZMC) is a strategic ecosystem in Colombia, under threat from human-driven factors such as population growth and subsistence extraction activities. Local residents experience high poverty levels and low educational attainment, exacerbating conflicts between their socio-economic needs and marsh conservation efforts. This study aimed to present a participatory approach to prioritize actions for sustainable development in Chimichagua, the municipality encompassing the largest part of the ZMC. We identified and characterized local stakeholders, engaging them in a participatory action research project to determine barriers and opportunities for economic growth and food security. The insights gathered were collaboratively used to formulate actions that balance the sustainability of the ZMC with local economic development. Stakeholders identified the ZMC as an opportunity for employment and raw materials, while pointing to poor support from territorial entities as the central barrier. A prioritized action was the construction of a concentrate feed production plant utilizing local raw materials. This work offers a methodological contribution that could be applied to address socio-economic and environmental conflicts in other strategic ecosystems. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The sustainable fisheries management and usage of aquatic resources, investing in the Blue Economy and implementation of ecosystem approaches can enhance economic development, raise food security, improve nutrition and decrease poverty. Fishery resources from marine and inland waters, together with aquaculture, deliver food, nutrition and consider an important income source to upto 820, 000, 000 people worldwide, from collecting, processing, marketing, and dissemination. For numerous coastal communities, it constitutes part of their traditional ethnic identity. Many threats face the sustainability of global fishery resources such as overfishing, pollution, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and recently the climate changes. In Egypt, fish production from natural resources and aquaculture plays a vital role in food security, livelihood, national GDP, poverty alleviation, and employment opportunities in rural areas. Egypt achieves fish production of about 1.9 million tons: 1.6 million tons from aquaculture, and about 0.3 million tons from natural resources. The natural resources in Egypt (marine and inland resources) had severely declined in the last decades; this enhanced the efforts to promote responsible and sustainable fisheries and aquaculture practices and preserve healthy marine environments. This chapter will describe the current status of Egyptian marine fisheries, will address the main challenges facing its development, and will give some practical solutions for its sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The way we grow and consume food is changing both landscapes and societies globally. The constraints and challenges we face in meeting the anticipated large increase in global food demand out to 2050 are examined to show that while they present significant difficulties on many fronts, we have a large range of choices in the way this food demand might be met. Meeting this future food demand has frequently been articulated as a crisis of supply alone by some dominant institutions and individuals with prior ideological commitments to a particular framing of the food security issue. Our analysis indicates that the crisis can be avoided by the choices we make. The food security debate will be enriched by a rigorous evaluation of all these choices and recognition that the eventual solution will reside in a mixture of these choices. We could shift from our current paradigm of productivity enhancement while reducing environmental impacts, to a paradigm where ecological sustainability constitutes the entry point for all agricultural development. If we embraced this new paradigm, sustainable governance and management of ecosystems, natural resources and earth system processes at large, could provide the framework for practical solutions towards an intensification of agriculture. Such a paradigm shift could reposition world food production from its current role as the world’s single largest driver of global environmental change, to becoming a critical part of a world transition to work within the boundaries of the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the planet’s biophysical processes and functions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - The global food system, and animal agriculture in particular, is a major and growing contributor to climate change, land system change, biodiversity loss, water consumption and contamination, and environmental pollution. The copious production and consumption of animal products are also contributing to increasingly negative public health outcomes, particularly in wealthy and rapidly industrializing countries, and result in the slaughter of trillions of animals each year. These impacts are motivating calls for reduced reliance on animal-based products and increased use of replacement plant-based products. However, our understanding of how the production and consumption of animal products, as well as plant-based alternatives, interact with important dimensions of human and environment systems is incomplete across space and time. This inhibits comprehensively envisioning global and regional food system transitions and planning to manage the costs and synergies thereof. We therefore propose a cross-disciplinary research agenda on future target-based scenarios for food system transformation that has at its core three main activities: (1) data collection and analysis at the intersection of animal agriculture, the environment, and societal well-being, (2) the construction of target-based scenarios for animal products informed by these new data and empirical understandings, and (3) the evaluation of impacts, unintended consequences, co-benefits, and trade-offs of these target-based scenarios to help inform decision-making. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa play a vital role in achieving food security and nutrition, yet they are often overlooked by development policies and lack access to the technology and information needed to increase their agricultural productivity. This is particularly true in Malawi, where smallholder farmers make up over 80% of the population and face a range of risks and challenges, including vulnerability to climate change, that threaten their livelihoods, food security, and nutrition. While drones and precision agriculture technology have had a significant impact on agriculture in high-income countries, their application by smallholder farmers in low-income countries is not well understood. This study, conducted in 2022, examines how drones can assist smallholder farmers in increasing their agricultural productivity and food security in Malawi. It explores how smallholders perceive the use of drones and the potential benefits and limitations of using drones in their farming operations. A unique aspect of this study aims to understand smallholders’ perceptions of open data and data privacy. The results show that when smallholder farmers interact with drone data, they have a better understanding of their farm and are able to make more informed decisions that use fewer inputs and reduce production costs. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential for drones to assist smallholder farmers improve their on-farm knowledge, increase agricultural productivity, and mitigate the risks and challenges they face, leading to improved livelihoods and a more sustainable and secure food supply. Policymakers can promote the adoption of drone technology among smallholder farmers by developing policies that encourage public–private partnerships to create affordable, locally adapted drone technologies and programs that meet their unique needs, while also ensuring responsible use of drones in agriculture through regulations that address concerns about data privacy and security. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Human population has been overexploiting natural resources for many decades. Consumerism drives a strong economy, but at the same time it degrades the environment. The solution is to turn it into sustainable development. In this study, our aim was to determine how the quest for sustainable consumption was perceived in the current scientific literature; Methods: A total of 712 papers from the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were investigated. Descriptive statistics and VOSviewer (version 1.6.18.) and Wordcloud software were used for further analysis. The analysis involved investigating publication trends over time, engaged countries and funding agencies, co-authorships, document types, thematic categories, sustainable development goals orientation, and the most frequently occurring words. Results: Word clouds created in the WordArt program based on the titles and abstracts indicated “food” to be the most frequently occurring word. The content of the articles was analyzed based on three term clusters: (1) “food waste”, “waste”, “food security”; (2) “agriculture” and “vertical farming”; and (3) “energy”. Conclusions: Analyzed articles surpassed the European Union, indicating the global range of striving for sustainability. The co-occurrence of the following sustainable development goals (SDGs) was indicated in the study: no. 1 (“no poverty”), no. 2 (“zero hunger”), no. 3 (“good health and well-being”), no. 6 (“clean water and sanitation”), no. 7 (“affordable and clean energy”), no. 8 (“decent work and economic growth”), no. 9 (“industry, innovation and infrastructure”), no. 10 (“reduced inequalities”), no. 12 (“responsible production and consumption”), no. 13 (“climate action”), no. 14 (“life below water”), and no. 15 (“life on land”). © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The issue of biofuels has already been much debated, but the focus to date has largely been on Latin America and deforestation - this highly original work breaks fresh ground in looking at the African perspective. Most African governments see biofuels as having the potential to increase agricultural productivity and export incomes and thus strengthen their national economies, improving energy balances and rural employment. At the same time climate change may be addressed through reduction of green house gas emissions. There are, however, a number of uncertainties mounting that challenge this scenario. Using cutting-edge empirical case studies, this knowledge gap is addressed in a variety of chapters examining the effects of large-scale biofuel production on African agriculture. In particular, 'land grabbing' and food security issues are scrutinised, both of which have become vital topics in regard to the environmental and developmental governance of African countries. A revealing book for anyone wishing to understand the startling impact of biofuels and land grabbing on Africa. © Prosper B. Matondi, Kjell Havnevik and Atakilte Beyene 2011.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the use of trade policy in addressing transboundary stock pollution problems such as acid rain and water pollution. We show that a tariff determined by the current level of accumulated pollution can induce the time path of emissions optimal for the downstream (polluted) country. But if the upstream (polluting) country can lobby the downstream government to impose lower tariffs, distortions brought by corruption and foreign lobbying lead to a rise in the upstream country’s social welfare, and to a decrease in social welfare in the downstream country. Thus, the usefulness of trade policy as a tool for encouraging cooperation and internalizing transboundary externalities depends critically on the degree of governments’ susceptibility to foreign political influence. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Water resources is a crucial environmental good for the function of the human societies and the ecosystems. Moreover, water is an important input for the economy and an indispensable factor for economic growth. Especially in regions that are facing water scarcity, the adoption of water management policies and approaches fostering the sustainable use of resources while promoting economic growth becomes an emerging issue. The Mediterranean region is one of the most vulnerable regions regarding the availability of water resources due to climate change and human activities. The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus offers an integrated approach analyzing the synergies and trade-offs between the different sectors in order to maximize the efficiency of using the resources, whereas adapting optimum policies and institutional arrangements. The Mediterranean is a region where we observe a large spectrum of issues emanating from water pollution and natural resource degradation to water scarcity, large amounts of food loss and waste and increasing demand for energy and food. Agricultural practices, urban development, demand management for water, and protection of ecosystems, particularly aquatic ecosystems, are areas of particular intervention available to the decision-makers in enhancing availability of water for the various water using sectors. In this context, the current policy note paper aims to address a major issue: how can the implementation of the WEF Nexus support the economic growth in the Mediterranean? Based on the outcome of an experts and stakeholders regional workshop, this paper presents the current status, including the opportunities and the practices of applying the WEF Nexus in the Mediterranean and draws specific recommendations for the way forward. Regarding the later, the strengthening of WEF Nexus in the Mediterranean requires a set of interventions to strengthen the institutional capacities, to enhance the finance mechanisms, to support the intra-regional dialogue as well, to enhance data collection and management, as well as to implement economic instruments and integrated economic approaches to measure the impact of Nexus into economy and employment. © 2019 Markantonis, Reynaud, Karabulut, El Hajj, Altinbilek, Awad, Bruggeman, Constantianos, Mysiak, Lamaddalena, Matoussi, Monteiro, Pistocchi, Pretato, Tahboub, Tunçok, ünver, Van Ek, Willaarts, Bülent, Zakir and Bidoglio.

AB  - The market fundamentalist logic underpinning WTO agricultural trade rules poses a profound threat to global food security in the context of climate change. The growing frequency of extreme weather events raises the prospect of large-scale disruption of agricultural production and distribution. A trading system oriented towards maximizing economic efficiency and reducing redundancy risks leaving the world population acutely vulnerable to food supply disruptions. Ensuring the resilience of global food systems will require considerably more, rather than less, state intervention in agricultural and food production, including cultivating agricultural surpluses to protect against supply shocks. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The commercial farming of Kappaphycus alvarezii in Indian waters has provided diversifying livelihood to the low-income artisanal fishermen for last 15 years. The sector has got commercial setback due to mass mortality of germplasm during 2013 – 2014. But considering its potential to provide inclusive economic growth in coastal rural settings, the government has renewed its interest in this activity. At the cusp of the strategic expansion of the seaweed sector understanding biosecurity risks, strategies and enforcement of framework is pivotal in reducing the impact of disease outbreaks, epiphytic infestations and pest attacks. The key category aspects include identification of the risks, evaluate the national health management for seaweed aquaculture, and providing potential biosecurity strategy for expanding commercial farming operations. Additionally we also enlisted the biosecurity strategy from other eucheumatoid-producing countries and nations involved in seaweed aquaculture for comparison. In-spite of advancements in science and technology, particularly in seaweed application-based solutions, health management and seaweed aquaculture biosecurity, still remain in their infancy in India. The analysis revealed that there is a complete absence of a national database of diseases, epiphytes, and grazers outbreak. Further limited clarity on a legal administrative procedures for the import of seaweed germplasm for commercial exploitation and its subsequent quarantine is a critical biosecurity risk. There is an urgent need to invest considerably in research and development related to the biosecurity of seaweeds. The rapid internet based technological development could be effectively utilised in disease reporting as well as developing farmer centric syndromic surveillance. The strengthening of regulatory frameworks and policy should be given the highest priority, as application of biosecurity has indirect effects in domains such as products development, food security, agriculture productivity, economic growth and potential regulatory ecosystem services. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This paper aims to review the role of smart city innovation for sustainable infrastructure in Bahrain. It studies people’s perception and awareness about the smart city. The paper articulates the imperatives for harnessing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for smart infrastructure. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (Bahrain is a member of GCC) face key challenges in water, energy and food security. This is exacerbated by climate change and energy dependence in spite of the region’s potential for solar and wind power and, in some cases, hydropower. Smart city innovations offer new possibilities for innovations to address the challenges in infrastructure. Technological innovations transform natural resources to serve human development. Green energy and ICT are becoming increasingly important in providing energy security and contributing to alleviating climate change risks. Hence, a transition to an innovative economy requires innovation in processes and technologies in infrastructure. The paper recommends that The GCC should be in line with the paradigm of mainstreaming green economy. Document analysis and a structured survey were used to collect data. The survey addressed three dimensions including Technology Enablers (TE), Smart Cities Strategies (SCS), and Social Awareness (SA). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Concerns over the two-legged march towards sustainability and biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes have sparked debates globally; both in research and development, socioeconomics and policy planning. While others argue that sustainable and biodiversity conserving agriculture is impractical, an increasing body of evidence continues to recognise the importance of biodiversity for human survival and environmental stability. Because of this recognition, the UN decided to integrate and prioritise biodiversity conservation in its sustainable development goals. Although the concept of biodiversity is recognised as a potential coping strategy for climate change and crop production challenges; the practicality of its integration in agriculture remains a challenge. In this paper, some of the important prospects that can support and facilitate biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes are briefly discussed. While we recognise that the path to sustainability is not going to be easy, we emphasise the need for integrated research from both the sectors of agriculture and conservation to be prioritised, to reconcile productive sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation. Such research should target trade-offs and synergies which can make it possible for these sectors to coexist and survive in their coexistence. This will be highly beneficial to facilitate and guide the sustainability and conservation policy planning. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - One of the basic requirements for sustainability is to focus upon the entire lifecycle of the product. In the agri-food sector, companies which achieve climate neutral agri-food products are distinguished by climate-neutral labels, in recognition of their social responsibility and contribution to environment protection. Valid CO2 certificates which minimize climate-impacting emissions include the right to achieve net zero carbon emissions by offsetting or buying enough carbon credits to achieve carbon neutral, or having a net zero carbon footprint. Furthermore, value adding can be achieved in the customer-driven value creation chains, as more and more consumers are becoming aware of the company's contribution in environmental protection. In this respect, the aim of this study is to shed light in the specific attributes and perspectives of such practices and to explore how they can transform the challenge of climate change to opportunity for environment protection and sustainability. The paper highlights the need for successfully implemented climate neutral products and services, involving collaborative innovations which may also result in total cost reduction and product quality upgrading, particularly if incorporated in Sustainable or Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM). Moreover, social and company benefits can accrue especially for agri-food products which have already labels like protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI) and traditional specialty guaranteed (TSG). This paper also includes a survey conducted with consumers for assessing their behavioral patterns with regard to such issues. Finally, the major contribution of this study is the development of a conceptual model that presents the necessary managerial steps towards the production of green and climate neutral products.

AB  - Continued investment in coal embroils regions in coal lock-ins, creating dependence and vested interests around coal and thereby limiting the speed and potential to switch to cleaner energy. In India, four states contribute 70% of coal production, with regions surrounding mines also housing significant operating and under-construction coal power stations. On the other hand, states in the west and south of India dominate current and near-term renewable energy capacity growth, broadly following patterns of highest resource potentials. We show that following current policies, by the end of the decade, coal-bearing states will likely sink deeper into carbon lock-ins, while the rest of the country, especially western and southern states could become increasingly decarbonised. Even in decarbonisation scenarios, gains from job and value creation in the clean energy sector might primarily take place away from existing coal regions, raising equity concerns, and ultimately putting the political feasibility of such a scenario in question. We suggest that policies aiming at higher renewable installations (mostly solar due to better potentials) in coal-bearing states, although not a one-to-one panacea, could provide an early break from lock-ins and into a just transition. This may, however, require a dedicated program and imply a small mark-up in power system costs. They would, however, help for medium-term diversification and job creation in all regions which will be key for assuring political support for the transition. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - 2020 revealed the vulnerability of the healthcare systems in most countries. It also highlighted their failure to generate serious progress in the fulfillment of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Ensure healthy lives and promote welfare for all at all ages. One of the key problems inhibiting its progress is the lack of financial resources. Based on a comprehensive meta-analysis of the literature related to SDG 3 and its investment, it aims to demonstrate that lack of appropriate academic support is a part of the failure to generate serious progress in the fulfillment of SDG 3. To do this academic literature published in the period 2010-2019 is analyzed. SciVal Elsevier, VosViewer, and Google Trends tools are applied for analysis. The results show that there is a significant interest in the academic circles on SDG 3 alone. However, this interest is concentrated toward its medical aspects while economic aspects, including investment, are poorly represented. This study shows that the reason for the current investment gap in SDG 3 is the lack of academic support to provide a theoretical, methodological, and analytical framework for tackling the financing problem for SDG 3. © Inna Makarenko, Alex Plastun, Mario Situm, Yuliia Serpeninova, Giuseppe Sorrentino, 2021

AB  - The concept of environmental sustainability has become a significant concern in the last several decades. The degradation of the environment has significant implications for human well-being, subsequently affecting productivity and economic growth. Consequently, achieving the goal of environmental sustainability emerges as a primary objective. The goal of this study is to develop an Environmental Sustainability Index that specifically targets factors related to air, land, and water. The second goal is to assess the short- and long-term impacts of fiscal policies on the environmental sustainability. The asymmetric influence of fiscal measures on sustainability is assumed in the present investigation. A time series data for the period 1974–2020 are used for the analysis. For the estimation of asymmetric effects, the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) technique is applied. Based on the research findings, it can be concluded that subsidy and developmental expenditures have a detrimental effect on environmental sustainability in the presence of positive shocks. Conversely, a negative shock in subsidies does not yield a significant impact, whereas a negative shock in development expenditures has a noteworthy and adverse influence on environmental sustainability. In the short run, the positive shock to both subsidy and developmental expenditures significantly affects environmental sustainability while the negative shock to developmental expenditure has an insignificant impact while subsidy has a significant effect on environmental sustainability. The study suggests that while making fiscal policies, the government should consider the environmental aspects of these measures. © 2024 United Nations.

AB  - The disruption of the global rice trade caused by climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and geopolitical tensions has the potential to harm food security and the stability of domestic rice prices. The main weakness of the current logistics system lies in the accuracy of demand and supply data, as well as the poor condition of the logistics infrastructure, which limits the government's ability to take immediate action to reduce price fluctuations that occur over a very fast period. This study aims to analyse the existing condition of the rice logistics system in Banten Province by using quantitative descriptive analysis. The results of the study show the high intensity of domestic rice trade and inter-regional dependence; thus, it is important to initiate the improvement of the logistics system in Banten Province. However, data collector institutions found difficulties in obtaining and recording data along the chain. Therefore, it is recommended to a) improve the data monitoring instruments for rice demand and supply and the understanding of these improved instruments, b) increase production capacity, c) strengthen the regional ability to intervene in the market, d) develop infrastructure that supports smooth and efficient distribution, and e) establish inter-regional cooperation to enhance rice logistics systems. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2024.

AB  - Increasing global demand for metals is putting strain on the ability of the mining industry to physically keep up with demand (physical scarcity). Conversely, social issues including the environmental and human health consequences of mining as well as the disparity in income distribution from mining revenues are disproportionately felt at the local community level. This has created social rifts, particularly in the developing world, between affected communities and both industry and governments. Such rifts can result in a disruption of the steady supply of metals (situational scarcity). Here we discuss the importance of mining in relationship to poverty, identify steps that have been taken to create a framework for socially responsible mining, and then discuss the need for academia to work in partnership with communities, government, and industry to develop transdisciplinary research-based step change solutions to the intertwined problems of physical and situational scarcity.

AB  - In recent years, the prediction of the potential effects of environmental degradation by activities of various sectors including aviation has led to stakeholders calling for a change coupled with the adoption of sustainable and circular supply chain practices to assist mitigate against the projected harmful impacts of climate change. The UAE serves as a major aviation hub partly due to its geographical location, hence the operations of airliners must conform to the current practices which could reduce the number of pollutants such as Carbon Dioxide and other plastic waste. Corporate Social Responsibility considered a core practice towards the realization of sustainability objectives could be pursued by stakeholders in aviation, a norm that could compel management to enforce strategies to achieve Etihad's sustainability goals. The study employed qualitative thematic analysis to interpret various interview questions given by key informants. Purposive sampling was however used to solicit information relating to the chosen topic. © 2023, IGI Global.

AB  - A large number of studies have examined the linkage between income inequality and environmental quality at the individual country levels. This study attempts to examine the linkage between the two factors for the individual BRICS economies from a comparative perspective, which is scarce in the literature. It examines the selected countries (Brazil, India, China and South Africa) by endogenising the patterns of primary energy consumption (coal use and petroleum use), total primary energy consumption, economic growth, and urbanisation as key determining factors in CO2 emission function. The long-run results based on ARDL bounds testing revealed that income inequality leads to increase in CO2 emissions for Brazil, India and China, while the same factor leads to reduction in CO2 emissions for South Africa. However, it observes that while coal use increases CO2 emissions for India, China and South Africa, it has no effect for Brazil. In contrast, the use of petroleum products contributes to CO2 emissions in Brazil, while the use of the same surprisingly results in reduction of carbon emissions in South Africa, India and China. The findings suggest that given the significance of income inequality in environmental pollution, the policy makers in these emerging economies have to take into consideration the role of income inequality, while designing the energy policy to achieve environmental sustainability. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - An increasing number of factors, including dwindling arable land, dwindling natural resources, and more intense and unpredictable weather events, have put food security at the forefront of international agendas. The agricultural industry is responding to these challenges by implementing "smart agriculture"strategies that make use of big data and the IoT to increase operational efficiency and productivity. The three main components are feature selection, model training, and preprocessing. For the purpose of preprocessing, the proposed approach use zero unitarization and methods for normalizing diagnostic characteristics that are based on the Quotient Transform formula. Both IG and principal component analysis (PCA) are utilized in feature selection. IG outperforms PCA in terms of accuracy. To make the model training process more accurate, we employed the Hybrid-A-Residual-UNet. With an accuracy of 97.55%, the suggested method outperforms its competitors' methods, such as HDA and ResUNet. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The global carbon sequestration and avoided emissions potentially achieved via blue carbon is high (∼3% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions); however, it is limited by multidisciplinary and interacting uncertainties spanning the social, governance, financial, and technological dimensions. We compiled a transdisciplinary team of experts to elucidate these challenges and identify a way forward. Key actions to enhance blue carbon as a natural climate solution include improving policy and legal arrangements to ensure equitable sharing of benefits; improving stewardship by incorporating indigenous knowledge and values; clarifying property rights; improving financial approaches and accounting tools to incorporate co-benefits; developing technological solutions for measuring blue carbon sequestration at low cost; and resolving knowledge gaps regarding blue carbon cycles. Implementing these actions and operationalizing blue carbon will achieve measurable changes to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, provide multiple co-benefits, and address national obligations associated with international agreements. © 2022

AB  - The balance between water supply and demand is essential for industrial growth, affecting economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Our research employs a Gaussian process regression for demand prediction. Additionally, it takes into account water limits and policy thresholds when determining the supply, thereby defining a range of uncertainty for both the industrial demand and the supply. A pattern recognition method matches this trade-off range, identifying three patterns to support water management. The study focuses on the analysis of industrial water supply and demand dynamics under uncertain conditions in nine cities (Baiyin, Dingxi, Gannan, Lanzhou, Linxia, Pingliang, Qingyang, Tianshui, and Wuwei) in Gansu Province of China’s Yellow River Basin in 2030. The results of the study show that industrial water use in Baiyin, Linxia, Dingxi, and Tianshui cities falls into Pattern I, providing water resources to support industrial development. Industrial water use in Wuwei, Pingliang, Qingyang, and Gannan cities represents Pattern II, which maintains a balance between supply and demand while allowing flexibility in water demand. Finally, the industrial water use in Lanzhou city is characterized by Pattern III, which requires optimization through structural, technological, and management improvements to mitigate the negative impacts of water scarcity on the sustainable development of the economy and society. The results of the research can be used as a reference for policy making in water resources planning and management in the basin. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Water scarcity constrains agricultural production and leads to significant economic losses. However, existing water scarcity risk (WSR) assessments often overlook the combined effects of water availability, quality, and efficiency, as well as potential mitigation benefits. This study develops an integrated assessment framework that incorporates these factors to evaluate agricultural WSR in the Yellow River Basin, a critical grain-producing region in China. The framework quantifies both direct economic losses in agriculture and indirect impacts on non-agricultural sectors through intercity trade, while also estimating mitigation benefits. Results show that insufficient water quality significantly amplifies economic losses, reaching 1189.9 billion CNY, compared to 391.0 billion CNY when only water quantity is considered. Key supply chain sectors, including food and tobacco processing, chemicals, and textiles, account for 56.6 % of total indirect agricultural WSR exports. Among mitigation measures, improving water quality and water-use efficiency reduces economic losses by 72.5 billion CNY and 53.2 billion CNY, respectively. Meanwhile, utilizing mine water in coal-rich regions and reclaimed water in urban centers can significantly reduce economic losses, with Ordos and Qingdao experiencing reductions of 75.4 % and 39.1 %, respectively. This framework provides a comprehensive approach to agricultural water management, integrating economic loss estimation with mitigation benefits to support sustainable water resource management. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - China's increasingly urbanized and wealthy population is driving a growing and changing demand for food, which might not be met without significant increase in agricultural productivity and sustainable use of natural resources. Given the past relationship between lack of access to affordable food and political instability, food security has to be given a high priority on national political agendas in the context of globalization. The drive for increased food production has had a significant impact on the environment, and the deterioration in ecosystem quality due to historic and current levels of pollution will potentially compromise the food production system in China. We discuss the grand challenges of not only producing more food but also producing it sustainably and without environmental degradation. In addressing these challenges, food production should be considered as part of an environmental system (soil, air, water, and biodiversity) and not independent from it. It is imperative that new ways of meeting the demand for food are developed while safeguarding the natural resources upon which food production is based. We present a holistic approach to both science and policy to ensure future food security while embracing the ambition of achieving environmental sustainability in China. It is a unique opportunity for China to be a role model as a new global player, especially for other emerging economies. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented shock to capture fisheries and aquaculture sectors. This scoping review of 670 articles explored the spatial, temporal, and thematic coverage of this event. The search period was January 1, 2020 to February 7, 2022. Articles were mainly peer-reviewed journals (88%) with the remainder from the gray literature (12%). Studies were performed at the global (21%), multi-country (11%), national (45%), and sub-national (23%) levels. Most studies involved primary or secondary data collection (71%) and the remainder were either review articles (17%) or commentaries (12%). Among the studies using primary and secondary data, nearly half (49%) were performed in the first five months of the pandemic (March to July 2020), and 84% within the first year of the pandemic (March 2020–February 2021). There were many studies in South and Southeast Asia, Southern Europe, China, and the United States, and fewer studies in other regions. The pandemic created challenges and opportunities, with heterogeneity in impacts among industrial and small-scale sectors, production methods, geographies, value chains, and by gender. Cumulative impacts from climate change and conflicts contributed to pandemic-related hardships. Increased unemployment and inflation led to rising food insecurity for small-scale producers, fishworkers, and low-income households. Aquatic food intake was more severely affected than other food groups during lockdowns, and it decreased more in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Responses were diverse, reflecting the capacity and resources of a country, but in general there was unprecedented public support to sustain the private sector (i.e., income support, tax relief, subsidies). As this study focused mainly on the first year of the pandemic, future work is needed to identify which groups exited the pandemic stronger or weaker, what factors enabled some populations to bounce-back, how the crisis affected value chains, and the effectiveness of interventions. © 2023 Food & Agricultural Organization.

AB  - Sustainable development has become a leading target of scientific research and policy agenda. In the context of natural resource management, understanding and evaluating the performance of complex socio-environmental systems has become a challenge, and the design of more sustainable alternatives is a driving need. In addition, there is a need to translate the general principles of sustainability into operational definitions and practices. This paper examines key methodological issues in the selection, transformation and aggregation of economic, environmental and social indicators for sustainability analysis. Specific reference is given to the MESMIS approach, a systemic, participatory, interdisciplinary and flexible framework for sustainability evaluation. The MESMIS framework has been developed by a multi-institutional team in Mexico and validated through its application to more than 20 case studies in Mexico and Latin America. The MESMIS operative structure is a six step cycle. The first three steps are devoted to the characterisation of the systems, the identification of critical points and the selection of specific indicators for the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability. In the last three steps, the information obtained by means of the indicators is integrated through mixed (qualitative and quantitative) techniques and multicriteria analysis, so as to obtain a value judgement about the resource management systems and to provide suggestions and insights aimed at improving their socio-environmental profile. MESMIS attempts to generate a cyclic process which, by effectively integrating the evaluation into the decision making process, improves the likelihood of success in the design of alternatives and the implementation of development projects. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - While China possesses abundant natural resources, their utilization efficiency remains low. As economic and social development progress rapidly, promoting natural resource utilization efficiency is crucial for the construction of the country's ecological capacity. However, research investigating the effect of income inequality on natural resource utilization efficiency is insufficient. Using the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2019, this paper analyzes the impact of income inequality on natural resource utilization efficiency. The empirical results denote that income inequality has a significantly negative impact on natural resource utilization efficiency and presents a discernible influence on lower green innovation ability and natural resource endowment. In addition, green fiscal policy and industrial agglomeration can alleviate the negative impact of income inequality on natural resource utilization efficiency. Furthermore, the threshold effect reveals that, with technological progress, the negative impact of income inequality on natural resource utilization efficiency has transformed into a positive. © 2023

AB  - Climate change significantly impacts the prevailing climatic conditions and crop productivity. Although soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration can mitigate global climate change, the SOC sequestration capacity and crop production under conservation tillage are unclear. This study assessed the dynamics and relationship between SOC storage and grain yield under conservation tillage over eight years. Four tillage and straw management treatments, including (i) no-tillage with straw retention (NTS, conservation tillage), (ii) conventional tillage with straw retention (CTS), (iii) no-tillage without straw retention (NT), and (iv) conventional tillage without straw retention (CT), were conducted. The results showed that the SOC content and storage in the 0–10 cm soil layer were significantly higher in NTS than in the other treatments. In contrast, SOC content and storage in the 10–30 cm layer were lower in NTS than in CTS (P < 0.05). Overall, the average SOC storage in the 0–30 cm was significantly higher in the straw returning treatment than without straw returning (P < 0.05). Moreover, SOC storage was not significantly different between NTS (35.7 Mg ha−1) and CTS (35.9 Mg ha−1). The wheat yield was lowest under NTS. Furthermore, the yield coefficient of variation under NTS was significantly lower than under CTS (P < 0.05). Maize yield was not significantly different between NTS and CTS. SOC storage in the 0–10 cm soil layer had a quadratic relationship with annual yield. These results indicate that NTS can positively sequester carbon, especially for the surface layer. However, to mitigate climate change and food insecurity, further advancements in NTS technology are required to improve crop yields and carbon sequestration capacity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Settling a “green recovery” at the center of all economic recuperation procedures is progressively seen as the finest and as the only way nations could restore their economies. Therefore, this study assesses the role of energy finance, green policies, and investment towards green economic recovery in the USA by using a linear econometric approach and nonlinear (DSGE) model. Considering the fiscal tax-lowering rate, for instance, the study evaluates the effects of fiscal measures on local fiscal pressures in the USA regarding the pandemic. The regression analysis shows that both energy finance and green energy policies have positive and statistically significant impacts on green investment. The results from the linear econometric approach indicate that every additional state green energy policy tool adopted is associated with 1% more green investment in the USA. In addition, the findings show that green policies in human resources and R&D of green energy technologies prompt a sustainable green economy through labor and technology-oriented production activities. Implications for scholars, investors, technology managers, and policymakers are derived and discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The Chinese government aims to mitigate climate change while also reducing local air pollution; this requires co-control of greenhouse gases and pollutants. Here, we develop a method combining an elasticity analysis and a multi-regional input–output model, to measure changes in the emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants and corresponding socio-economic costs caused by the adjustments in intermediate input, inter-regional trade, and final demand transactions for 30 provinces in China. A filter framework is proposed to identify the key structural transactions that can significantly co-control both emission types with small socio-economic impacts. The results show that 13 effective co-control spots can simultaneously reduce greenhouse gases and pollutants. Among these, eight co-controls are associated with low economic costs, which we refer to as ‘sweet spots’. Sweet spots cover agricultural inputs in the food and tobacco sectors of Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Liaoning, and Hubei; self-inputs in the agriculture of Henan; self-inputs in the food and tobacco sector of Shandong; fixed capital formation of agriculture in Hebei; and urban household consumption of agricultural products in Guangdong. This finding is important, as climate measures mostly side-line the agricultural sector so far, both in China and in other parts of the world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The need to re-envision alternative paradigms in tourism is becoming evident with the increasingly experienced climate change and degradation of life supporting ecosystem services, to which the tourism industry has a significant adverse contribution. Could tourism be re-envisioned to bring positive effects on social, environmental and individual wellbeing? In this paper, we present the outcome of an extensive literature review and a cross-border post card workshop with researchers and tourism officials. Drawing on this, a conceptual framework of a comprehensive, relational idea of wellbeing tourism is proposed, that extends beyond our current notion of sustainability and the widely used and accepted triple bottom line model (TBL). The suggested model proposes a shift from focusing on sustainability alone, to giving increased attention and value to integral health and to life quality. The paper highlights that wellbeing tourism can only truly be reached when all its suggested six pillars are fulfilled in a relative balance among the community related external ones (environment, economy, social; “sustainability”) and those that may be experienced as individual (body, mind, soul). The importance of wellbeing tourism supporting a society with the governing characteristics of happiness, harmony, and abundance, building collaborative and regenerative systems are emphasised. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Developing an alternative water-fertilizer-saving management practice for winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system in the North China Plain (NCP) is urgent to address severe water scarcity and adverse environmental impacts. A four-year field experiment in split plot design was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplemental drip irrigation on grain yield, water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), nitrogen (N) loss and economic benefits, keeping three supplemental drip irrigation times (DI0, no irrigation after emergence; DI3, irrigation once at wheat jointing, once at maize seedling and once at maize jointing; DI5, irrigation once at wheat jointing, once at wheat anthesis, once at maize seedling, once at maize jointing and once at maize tasseling) in the main plots and three N fertilizer rates (N0, no N fertilizer; N60%, 60% of the local recommended N fertilizer rate, 272 kg N ha−1 yr−1; N100%, 100% of the local recommended N fertilizer rate, 453 kg N ha−1 yr−1) in the sub plots. The traditional surface irrigation regime was also conducted as control (CK) under local recommended N fertilizer at 453 kg N ha−1 yr−1. The results showed that DI5N60% achieved the highest WUE in wheat (1.93 kg m−3) and maize (3.00 kg m−3) on average, which was 3.0% and 25.3% higher compared to CK, respectively. The highest partial factor productivity from applied N (PEPN) in wheat and maize were also observed in DI5N60% (56.8 kg kg−1 and 56.3 kg kg−1, respectively) on average, which was 54.0% and 74.0% higher compared to CK, respectively. For winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system, DI5N60% can generally achieve similar crop yield and net income but reduce irrigation and N fertilizer use and N loss compared to CK. Therefore, DI5N60% was considered as an alternative water-fertilizer-saving management practice for winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system in the NCP. Moreover, the optimized combination of irrigation amount and N fertilizer rate corresponding simultaneously to higher crop yield, WUE and net income were determined by using the response surface methodology based on binary quadratic regression analysis, and the optimal irrigation amount were 165 mm and 90 mm, optimal N rates were 186 kg N ha−1 and 185 kg N ha−1 for winter wheat and summer maize, respectively. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The 'food regime' concept helps to analyse potential transitions beyond the agro-industrial regime which has been globally dominant since the 1970s. As its multiple crises generate alternative production methods and products, some have been incorporated into a nascent 'corporate-environmental food regime'. This nascent regime is illustrated here by two agendas prominent in Europe - 'bioeconomy' (Life Sciences) and 'sustainable intensification' (neoproductivism). As a significant difference, the prevalent 'bioeconomy' agenda marginalises agroecological practices, while 'sustainable intensification' selectively incorporates such practices within a broader toolkit including biotech. Regardless of that difference, both agendas reinforce a neoliberal productivist narrative: namely, more resource-efficient methods are necessary for increasing production to fulfill the greater market demand for food, feed, fuel, etc. In this way, the capital-accumulation driver is reified as 'market demand' arising exogenously from the food production system - which thereby accommodates societal needs. By contrast, the agroecology narrative diagnoses the problem as profit-driven agro-industrial monoculture systems making farmers dependent on external inputs, undermining their knowledge, and distancing consumers from agri-producers. Through such a narrative, new alliances have elaborated a different future linking farmers' knowledge-exchange, agroecology, food sovereignty, citizens' initiatives, public knowledge about food production, etc. Civil society organisations have facilitated such linkages among researchers, scientists and social movements. In those ways, contending narratives justify different trajectories for an agro-food transition. Each links different innovation paradigms of technique, quality and knowledge. These differences often remain implicit amidst broad terms such as bioeconomy, sustainable intensification, agroecology, etc. Making the divergences explicit can help contest transitions towards a corporate-environmental food regime, while also counterposing agroecological alternatives. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Substantial investment has been made in the capital market for health-related products, applying advanced technologies in healthcare facilities and investing human capital into health industries. These are important elements to build resilient infrastructure in the healthcare sector that contributes to the local economy for the sustainability of cities or communities. Resilient infrastructure refers to the ability and capacity of physical systems, such as buildings, utilities, and transportation networks, to withstand shocks or disruptions caused by natural disasters (e.g. earthquakes), climate change events (e.g. floods), or outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining essential functions and services for local communities. Hence, a long-term strategy for health promotion should integrate the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as a foundation, which provides an international guideline and standard for health promotion practices, in order to establish a balance of economic development and financial sustainability of health services. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to reflection for health services to build resilient infrastructure to increase the efficiency of health service management by green or clean energy to support healthcare infrastructure (SDG 7), innovative medical devices (SDG 9), and sustainable healthcare production and consumption with green supply chain management (SDG 12). However, this approach requires strategic partnership (SDG 17) in the health sector, particularly public-private partnerships (PPPs), between public-sector companies and social service organisations, or between private companies and healthcare research institutions, to explore innovative ways to address the issues. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Ben Y.

AB  - This article explores the artificial nature of the neo-liberal legal narratives on GMOs, complementing Anne Saab’s analysis of the Public International Law (‘PIL’) climate change adaptation regime with a deconstruction of the hegemonic transnational legal discourse on the risks, costs and benefits of agricultural biotechnologies. The enquiry into the dominant regulatory approach to the governance of GMO risks sheds light on its specific political and socio-economic implications, lending support to the argument that GMOs are identified as a strategy to tackle food insecurity and facilitate climate change adaptation simply because their development, patenting and trade serve the profit-making goals of transnational market actors. Against this backdrop, the PIL discourse on climate resilient GMOs and the hegemonic transnational legal narrative on GMO safety and food security turn out to be two sides of the same coin. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Food security under climate change, several sustainability problems, and ambitious climate targets are considered challenges for agriculture and food sectors in many countries. Since agricultural production and its land use produce appr. 20% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Finland, reducing agricultural GHG emissions is important for meeting national target of climate neutrality by 2035. Healthier food diets, maintenance of biodiversity, and reduced nutrient leaching from agriculture are also required for a more sustainable food economy. This paper aims to show how agriculture in Finland, traditionally dominated by livestock production, could decrease GHG emissions significantly and simultaneously respond to other sustainability concerns. Our results, based on economic modelling of the agricultural sector, suggest that moderate changes in food diets and land use can reduce GHG emissions of agriculture by more than 40% by 2050 if productivity growth and policy changes support the overall change in the agriculture and food sector. Adaptation to climate change, e.g. more higher crop yields efficient input use, is necessary for productivity growth. Decreased demand for meat and decreased cultivation of feed crops would decrease GHG emissions and free up land for carbon sequestration through afforestation. Whilst healthier food diets imply less livestock and increased imports of protein crops for food, a reasonable volume of livestock production is useful for maintaining food security, grasslands, crop rotations, soil carbon, and biodiversity. We conclude that transition to low carbon and more sustainable agriculture is possible without risking food security at northern latitudes. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The Anthropocene has brought with it many challenges, the primary of which are climate change and food security. The growing global population increasingly demands more from a shrinking resource base, while variable climate conditions make future provision uncertain. To address issues of low agricultural productivity and land degradation, conservation agriculture (CA) has been promoted in smallholder settings across Africa. CA is an agricultural package that consists of three key principles (minimum soil disturbance, mulching, and crop rotation) and its success depends on the simultaneous implementation of all three principles. However, CA has met with limited success. A scoping review was conducted to assess the barriers and enablers of CA for smallholder farmers in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) – a regional inter-governmental economic community. The scoping review included peer-reviewed articles, book chapters, reviews, and grey literature written in English that focused on the contextual links between CA adoption and the smallholder context, since 2015. Six electronic databases were consulted, and included records were charted according to a pre-defined data extraction form. A total of 66 records were included. A qualitative content analysis was performed. The findings indicated four central themes – physical resources, human resources, informational resources, and financial resources. The four central themes and their respective categories, detailing barriers and enablers, were combined to produce the Conservation Agriculture Suitability Framework for Smallholder Farmers. The review contributes to the knowledge base of the CA discipline and practice by revealing the contextual determinants of successful CA implementation. Ultimately, the success of CA in southern Africa will be underpinned by how well it fits into the broader smallholder farming system. © 2022

AB  - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the blueprints for achieving a sustainable future, and understanding the interlinkages among social, economic, and environmental fields is a key factor in accomplishing them. The goal of this study was to analyze a framework for sustainable economic growth considering the trade-offs among economic inequality, resource security, and labor requirement through an industrial water, energy, and labor (I-WEL) nexus approach. We analyzed the economic intensity of industrial water, energy, and labor in 47 prefectures in Japan; we found that the more industrialized prefectures showed lower water but higher energy intensities than relatively less industrialized prefectures. We then classified four I-WEL nexus zones—high efficiency, labor-intensive, water-intensive, and water- and energy-intensive zones—based on their economic intensities and by using the K-means clustering method. Finally, we applied economic growth scenarios, weighted by I-WEL nexus zones, and quantified water, energy, and labor requirements by scenario at the local, regional, and national scales. The results show that, by using weighted economic growth in the high-efficiency I-WEL nexus zones and relative to the baseline scenario (which assigns equal ratios of increased economic growth to all prefectures), a potential savings of 337 Mm³/year of freshwater and 184 PJ/year of energy can be realized. However, as the more industrially developed prefectures were included in the high-efficiency zone, this scenario increased the Gini coefficient, i.e., the economic inequality among prefectures. In summary, this study shows that the application of the I-WEL nexus can be used as a framework for sustainable economic growth considering the trade-offs between efficiency of resource use and economic inequality. © 2021

AB  - In Latin America, the energy transition has been characterized by a shift from oil to gas as a fuel for electricity generation, as well as a significant presence of hydroelectric power and increasing diversification of renewable energy sources with the participation of biomass, solar, and wind. There is scarce participation of coal in the energy mix compared to the other regions of the world. Energy transitions in Latin America are a more complex process that refers not only to changing the energy system but also to ensuring that the transition benefits all people, including the vulnerable population. This requires addressing issues related to affordability, accessibility, and sustainability of energy production and supply. Moreover, the region faces several challenges such as low long-term economic growth, high dependence on oil revenues and raw materials in its export structure, the establishment of sacrifice zones that this dependence causes on local communities, social inequality, and limited access to public goods. By considering the interplay between the various factors, challenges, and opportunities, policymakers and stakeholders can develop more effective strategies for achieving sustainable energy transitions in the region. This book offers a thorough and insightful analysis of the challenges and opportunities related to transitioning to sustainable energy systems in Latin America. It gives insights into oil-dependent countries' problems and the urgency of tackling climate change. The diverse topics covered in the book, including geopolitics, energy trilemma, energy access, poverty, decentralization, and democratization, present a multidimensional perspective. Overall, this book provides a valuable resource for anyone seeking to understand the complex challenges and opportunities in transitioning to sustainable energy systems in Latin America. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - The criticism of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and economic growth is now decades old but many misconceptions remain about the alleged linkages between GDP growth, human well-being and social progress. This article starts by contrasting economic growth on the one hand and human development on the other, theoretically and empirically. It then argues that economic growth is actually not central to supporting social policy as often believed. Finally, it shows that the well-being transition beyond GDP and growth, already under way around the world, can take the form of three social-ecological policies. © 2022,Ekonomiaz.

AB  - This paper strives to answer the general question; how far purchasers of logistics services take into account aspects of sustainable development. Modeled on the German Sustainable Development Strategy, which is based on the EU Sustainable Development plan, five fields of activity are defined: the reduction of transport intensity and emission, the reduction of land use, the choice of carrier under consideration of sustainable aspects, the permanent improvement of working conditions, and the enhancement of qualified employment. Then, propositions for purchasing companies of logistics services are developed, which contribute to safeguard ecological as well as social sustainability. In order to conduct an explorative study, a questionnaire was sent to 750 purchase and logistics managers. It was found that purchasing companies place high value on ecological and social aspects. But the perceived importance is not associated with purchasing companies' own contributions to logistics service providers' sustainable activities. Additionally, it was seen that purchasing companies exert only a minor influence on logistics service providers regarding ecologically and socially sustainable actions. A fundamental precondition for a sustainably oriented procurement of logistics services can be seen in the purchasing companies' awareness of the need for integrating sustainable aspects in economic decisions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In countries with transitional economies such as those found in South Asia, large-scale irrigation systems (LSIS) with a history of public ownership account for about 115 million ha (Mha) or approximately 45% of their total area under irrigation. In terms of the global area of irrigation (320 Mha) for all countries, LSIS are estimated at 130 Mha or 40% of irrigated land. These systems can potentially deliver significant local, regional and global benefits in terms of food, water and energy security, employment, economic growth and ecosystem services. For example, primary crop production is conservatively valued at about US$355 billion. However, efforts to enhance these benefits and reform the sector have been costly and outcomes have been underwhelming and short-lived. We propose the application of a 'theory of change' (ToC) as a foundation for promoting transformational change in large-scale irrigation centred upon a 'global irrigation compact' that promotes new forms of leadership, partnership and ownership (LPO). The compact argues that LSIS can change by switching away from the current channelling of aid finances controlled by government irrigation agencies. Instead it is for irrigators, closely partnered by private, public and NGO advisory and regulatory services, to develop strong leadership models and to find new compensatory partnerships with cities and other river basin neighbours. The paper summarises key assumptions for change in the LSIS sector including the need to initially test this change via a handful of volunteer systems. Our other key purpose is to demonstrate a ToC template by which large-scale irrigation policy can be better elaborated and discussed.

AB  - Climate change can severely impact artisanal fisheries and affect the role they play in food security. We study climate change effects on the triple bottom line of ecological productivity, fishers’ incomes, and fish consumption for an artisanal open-access fishery. We develop and apply an empirical, stochastic bio-economic model for the Senegalese artisanal purse seine fishery on small pelagic fish and compare the simulated fishery’s development using four climate projections and two policy scenarios. We find that economic processes of adaptation may amplify the effects of climate variations. The regions’ catch potential increases with climate change, induced by stock distribution changes. However, this outcome escalates over-fishing, whose effects outpace the incipiently favorable climate change effects under three of the four climate projections. Without policy action, the fishery is estimated to collapse in 2030–2035 on average over 1000 runs. We propose an easily implementable and overall welfare-increasing intervention: reduction of fuel subsidies. If fuel subsidies were abolished, ecological sustainability as well as the fishery’s welfare contribution would increase regardless of the climate projection. © 2019 Lancker et al.

AB  - If reasonable fishery harvests and environmental harms are specified in new regulations, policies, and laws governing the exploitation of fish for food and livelihoods, then societal baselines can shift to achieve sustainable fisheries and marine conservation. Fisheries regulations can limit the environmental and social costs or harms caused by fishing by requiring the fishing industry to pay for the privilege to fish, via access fees for the opportunity to catch fish and extraction fees for fish caught; both fees can be combined with a progressive environmental tax to discourage overcapitalization and overfishing. Fisheries policies can be sustainable if predicated on an instrumental and ethical harm principle to reduce fishing harm. To protect the public trust in fisheries, environmental laws can identify the unsustainable depletion of fishery resources as ecological damage and a public nuisance to bind private fishing enterprises to a harm principle. Collaborative governance can foster sustainable fisheries if decision-making rights and responsibilities of marine stewardship are shared among government, the fishing industry, and civil society. As global food security and human welfare are threatened by accelerating human population growth and environmental impacts, decisions of how to use and protect the environment will involve collective choices in which all citizens have a stake - and a right. © 2012 by the author(s).

AB  - Among soil-centric options for addressing global issues being intensely debated by soil scientists, ecologists and earth scientists regarding their effectiveness and applicability are: (a) harnessing soil carbon (C) sink capacity for adaptation and mitigation of climate change; (b) reducing soil erosion as a source of greenhouse gases and the need to include it in the global C budget; (c) enhancing use efficiency of inputs to agroecosystems and returning land, water and other resources back to nature; (d) using global drylands, saline culture, halomorphic plants and brackish water for provisioning of ecosystem services; and (e) adopting a system-based conservation agriculture for eco-intensification of agroecosystems as a strategy of “producing more from less”. Not only should agriculture be made a solution for addressing global issues, but it is also essential to reconciling the need for advancing food and nutritional security with the absolute necessity of enhancing the environment, restoring degraded soils and desertified ecosystems, and advancing Sustainable Development Goals or the Agenda 2030. Highlights: Sustainable soil management, degraded soil restoration abridging agronomic yield gap and improving the environment are important to achieve world peace. Sustainable eco-intensification of agro-ecosystems reduces inputs and enhances use efficiency by restoring soil health. Harnessing soil carbon sink capacity includes reducing accelerated soil erosion for adaptation and mitigation of climate change. System-based conservation agriculture sustains agronomic productivity and minimizes soil degradation and environmental pollution. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - World soils have been a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide since the dawn of settled agriculture, which began about 10 millennia ago. Most agricultural soils have lost 30% to 75% of their antecedent soil organic carbon (SOC) pool or 30 to 40 t C ha. The magnitude of loss is often more in soils prone to accelerated erosion and other degradative processes. On a global scale, CO2-C emissions since 1850 are estimated at 270 ± 30 giga ton (billion ton or Gt) from fossil fuel combustion compared with 78 ± 12 Gt from soils. Consequently, the SOC pool in agricultural soils is much lower than their potential capacity. Furthermore, depletion of the SOC pool also leads to degradation in soil quality and declining agronomic/biomass productivity. Therefore, conversion to restorative land uses (e.g., afforestation, improved pastures) and adoption of recommended management practices (RMP) can enhance SOC and improve soil quality. Important RMP for enhancing SOC include conservation tillage, mulch farming, cover crops, integrated nutrient management including use of manure and compost, and agroforestry. Restoration of degraded/desertified soils and ecosystems is an important strategy. The rate of SOC sequestration, ranging from 100 to 1000 kg ha year, depends on climate, soil type, and site-specific management. Total potential of SOC sequestration in the United States of 144 to 432 Mt year (288 Mt year) comprises 45 to 98 Mt in cropland, 13 to 70 Mt in grazing land, and 25 to 102 Mt in forestland. The global potential of SOC sequestration is estimated at 0.6 to 1.2 Gt C year, comprising 0.4 to 0.8 Gt C year through adoption of RMP on cropland (1350 Mha), and 0.01 to 0.03 Gt C year on irrigated soils (275 Mha), and 0.01 to 0.3 Gt C year through improvements of rangelands and grasslands (3700 Mha). In addition, there is a large potential of C sequestration in biomass in forest plantations, short rotation woody perennials, and so on. The attendant improvement in soil quality with increase in SOC pool size has a strong positive impact on agronomic productivity and world food security. An increase in the SOC pool within the root zone by 1 t C ha year can enhance food production in developing countries by 30 to 50 Mt year including 24 to 40 Mt year of cereal and legumes, and 6 to 10 Mt year of roots and tubers. Despite the enormous challenge of SOC sequestration, especially in regions of warm and arid climates and predominantly resource-poor farmers, it is a truly a win-win strategy. While improving ecosystem services and ensuring sustainable use of soil resources, SOC sequestration also mitigates global warming by offsetting fossil fuel emissions and improving water quality by reducing nonpoint source pollution. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - The BIOBOR project: Bornizo for the Bio-economy, proposes a multidisciplinary approach to promote cork production in cork oak groves planted during the period 1993-2000, thanks to the subsidies granted by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), within the afforestation programs promoted by the European Economic Community (EEC) directive 2080/92. In many of these cork oak groves planted in Spain, no forestry action has been carried out since then and this lack of management could lead to the abandonment of the cork oak groves. Therefore, promoting cork production in these young cork oak groves will help to prevent their abandonment and will stimulate economic, environmental and social activity in these areas. The project has developed guidelines for good practices in forest management, analyzed new uses of bornizo in more renewable and ecological technological applications and evaluated the sustainability of these woodlands. Ultimately, the main aim of the project is the promotion of cork production in juvenile cork oak forests by developing tools that facilitate production startup in youth cork oak stands and considering the environmental impacts throughout the process. © 2023 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

AB  - Although political economy (PE) has long engaged with environmental issues, climate change has remained at the margins of the field until very recently. This article argues that fully addressing the transformative challenges brought up by climate change requires a fundamental rethinking of core PE concepts related to the state, distributional struggles, economic growth, varieties of capitalism, and markets. Rather than treating the state as a neutral regulator or market facilitator, we conceptualize the green state as actively structuring transitions through mitigation policies, adaptation strategies, and the governance of just transition conflicts. Green transitions generate new distributional conflicts—within and across countries, between incumbent and emerging industries, and among social groups with unequal exposure to climate risks and transition costs. Climate policy also challenges growth-centered economic models, raising questions about the viability of green growth versus degrowth strategies. Different varieties of capitalism are evolving in response, with distinct institutional pathways shaping the speed and character of transition efforts. Finally, we critique market-based approaches that assume price mechanisms alone can drive decarbonization, highlighting the role of non-economic values, institutional constraints, and distributional struggles in shaping green markets. By linking climate change to core debates in comparative and international political economy, we identify new research agendas for understanding the uneven and contested pathways of green transitions across economic systems. This article, along with the others in this special issue on Greening the Economy: Toward a New Political Economy, aims to bridge some of these critical gaps. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - The modern history of organic farming in Russia began in 1989 with the implementation of the state program "Alternative Agriculture". Organic agriculture in Russia was initially considered as a condition and mechanism for the development of small and medium agricultural forms of production. The increase in the production of agricultural products and food in excess of the normative requirements, ensuring the country's food security led to the expansion of exports. Russia's aptitude to uphold fulfillment with global standards and be competitive in world markets where ecologically clean agricultural products are in demand is quite high: huge reserves of land in Russia, the introduction of ecological farming systems must be carried out on huge areas, coordinated with a large number of small owners. Information support for farmers about new, more efficient technical means, biotechnologies in organic agriculture and certification of organic products for environmental friend-liness, safety of manufactured products, the use of intensive biotechnologies, financial support of organic agriculture, processing and sale of organic products remain problematic. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - CONTEXT: Globally, rainfed regions encounter several constraints that limit crop production. Poor and degraded soils resulting from soil erosion are one among them. We hypothesized that a diversified cropping system in rainfed drylands can reduce soil erosion and improve soil health and crop productivity and meet the food security needs of rainfed farmers. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess potential diversified cropping systems in terms of reducing soil erosion and water and nutrient losses, and increasing crop and systems productivity and profitability. METHODS: The study was carried out at the Gungal Research Farm of ICAR Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (17o05’ N, 78o39’E) from 2015 to 16 to 2020–21. The study investigated seven diversified cropping systems (treatments): sorghum + pigeon pea- hedge lucerne, sorghum + pigeonpea- guinea grass, castor- hedge lucerne, castor- guinea grass, sorghum- fodder clusterbean- fodder cowpea- fodder horsegram, sole sorghum, and sole pigeonpea. Multi-criteria assessments were conducted to understand trade-offs related to soil nutrients and their losses, and productivity and profitability of various annual and perennial based systems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the various systems evaluated, sole sorghum was the most sensitive to soil erosion, leading to highest amount of nutrient loss in all years (87.5, 47.3, and 9.8 kg N, P and K ha−1 in 2019–20, 102.4, 58.2, 14.2 kg N, P and K ha−1 in 2020–21, and 78.6, 39.2, 6.16 kg N, P and K ha−1 in 2021–22). The perennial based cropping systems with more diverse crops and greater land cover that included sorghum + pigeonpea - guinea grass and sorghum + pigeon pea - hedge lucerne had the lowest amount of nutrient loss. The least cumulative monetary value of nutrient loss was in sorghum + pigeon pea - hedge lucerne (137.11 US$) followed by sorghum + pigeonpea - guinea grass (145.33 US$). The systems with diverse crops reduced runoff and soil erosion, improved soil health, and increased crop and systems productivity and profitability. The trade-offs analysis using the radar graphs also showed lower soil loss and improved soil heath in diversified perennial based cropping systems, resulting in increase in net income to US$1981 for sorghum + pigeonpea - hedge lucerne compared to US$909 for sole sorghum. SIGNIFICANCE: Perennial based cropping systems with diverse crops can be an effective strategy to reduce soil erosion and improve soil health, and increase crop and systems productivity in rainfed areas of south India. These results have implications to other countries globally with rainfed climate and dryland farming. © 2023

AB  - The paper highlights the urgent demand for sustainable energy transitions within planetary boundaries while addressing social injustices. This transformation significantly relies on increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources, which requires extensive mining and utilisation of energy transition metals like copper, cobalt, and lithium. Particular concerns arise when Indigenous lands are involved in mining operations, raising issues of human rights and environmental integrity. The European Union and the United States of America have responded to these concerns with legislative measures to enhance supply chain transparency and prevent conflicts stemming from unethical practices. The study aims to explore responsible sourcing efforts among renewable energy technology manufacturers operating in Europe in the context of these regulations and the obstacles they encounter. Through semi-structured interviews with sustainability and procurement managers, the research investigates internal and external drivers for responsible sourcing, identifying altruistic values and regulatory compliance as critical factors. Despite acknowledging the importance of responsible sourcing, supply chain complexity and resource limitations persist. Ultimately, the study suggests that while responsible sourcing initiatives have the potential to promote justice within supply chains, there is a pressing need for holistic approaches to overcome existing barriers and effectively implement sustainable practices across the renewable energy sector. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - The world cereal production and supply as well as their trade, stock and losses are important indicators of the world market of cereals. They play a huge role in ensuring food security. The aim of this research is to identify the relation of the indicators of the world grain crops market (production, supply, losses, trade, stocks) and the level of malnutrition Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) among the world's population. Based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), a correlation-regression analysis was conducted between indicators of the global grain crops market, in particular: the wheat market, the fodder market of grain crops, the rice market and PoU of the world population for the period 2013/14 - 2020/2021 marketing years. It has been proven that there is a close, statistically reliable relationship between the above mentioned indicators, except for grain stocks and POU. The analysis of the world cereal market showed that among the indicators characterizing its conditions, the indicator trade in grain crops (r = 0.851; D = 0.724; F = 3.968, (F > Ft); z = 1.26; rL = 0.37; rU = 0.97) has the highest level of correlation. It was found that with an increase in the volume of world cereal trade by 1 million tons, the PoU level will increase by 0.018%. A review of literary sources proves that the problem of ensuring food security, in particular with regard to reducing the level of starvation and malnutrition, cannot be solved only by fighting climate change, overcoming socio-economic and military problems, fighting pandemics, etc. Its solution to a large extent depends on fair, uniform export and import of food products, as evidenced by the calculations. A separate direction for solving the problem of the spread of malnutrition is the elimination of the policy of highly developed countries regarding the application of individual sanctions against countries with high PoU values, in particular, the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Haiti, Afghanistan, Chad, Congo, Lesotho, Liberia, Mozambique, etc. © 2024, Politechnika Lubelska.

AB  - Increasing support to small-holder farmers plays an important part in meeting the climate and development challenges of agriculture: realizing global food security under increasing climate variability, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and conserving natural resources. Cooperatives offer a well-established livelihood strategy and means to support small-holders. This case study examined a Ukrainian cooperative using the sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) to understand the role cooperatives play in addressing climate change, and the process by which capacity is used to adapt and/or mitigate climate change. Climate change does not prompt cooperative formation and climate change mitigation might not be a planned outcome in a livelihood strategy. However, modifying the SLF to include climate change outcomes provides a means of understanding the process by which building capacity results in mitigation and adaptation. Cooperative members and stakeholders outside of the cooperative participated in semi-structure interviews. Social capital emerged as a theme with interviewees from all backgrounds. Initially closed networks and distrust prevented members from joining the cooperative. As the cooperative built new networks, the benefit of joining became apparent to members. Information gained through networks improved access to other capitals, improved livelihood outcomes and addressed climate change. Social capital fulfils key roles in the process of capacity building and implementation of sustainable measures; thus improving social capital could arguably be the chief benefit of cooperatives. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Trade in staple crop commodities has become increasingly important in the global food system, with ramifications for both food security and water resources sustainability. It is thus essential to understand how the water footprint (WF) of staple crop trade may change in the future. To this end, we project international staple crop trade and its WF under climate and policy scenarios for the year 2030. We use the H08 global hydrologic model to determine the impact of climatic changes to staple crop yields and evapotranspiration. Using the yield changes projected with the H08 model, we estimate the bilateral trade of staple crops using the Global Trade Analysis Project model. We combine these projections to obtain the total and blue WF of agricultural trade and global water savings (GWS) across scenarios. This approach enables us to determine the direct impact of climate change and trade liberalization - together and in isolation - on the WF of staple crop trade. Importantly, we show that trade liberalization leads to greater WF, making it a potentially important adaptation measure to a changing climate, although future work is needed to distinguish high resolution crop water use, water stress, and commodity transfers. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This paper argues that taking up questions of value can help political ecologists and economists develop a more powerful analysis of the green economy, as it introduces new urban, industrial, and technological dimensions into a self-identified green capitalism. More specifically, I maintain that processes of green devaluation, decommodification, and techno-industrial replacement are as important in understanding green economic development as new value enclosure and green growth. Twenty-first-century green economic politics have been marked by Schumpeterian ambitions and zero-sum intra-capitalist struggles, alongside a more general hardening of anti-fossil fuel industry politics from both grassroots climate justice activists and, increasingly, mainstream investors. I explore three interrelated initiatives—disruptive innovation in Silicon Valley cleantech, the U.S. fossil fuel divestment movement, and the global financial industry’s stranded assets organizing—as windows into these struggles. Themes of devaluation, obsolescence (both technological and “moral”), and (more or less absolute) decommodification carry through this discussion as activists struggle to translate quantitative advances against fossil fuels into a more profound qualitative break. Understanding these fights is essential to developing more effective engaged scholarship on climate change and a just energy transition. © 2016 The Center for Political Ecology.

AB  - The potential for developing synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation has become a recent focus of both climate research and policy. Presumably the interest in synergies springs from the appeal of creating win-win situations by implementing a single climate policy option. However, institutional complexity, insufficient opportunities and uncertainty surrounding their efficiency and effectiveness present major challenges to the widespread development of synergies. There are also increasing calls for research to define the optimal mix of mitigation and adaptation. These calls are based on the misguided assumption that there is one single optimal mix of adaptation and mitigation options for all possible scenarios of climate and socio-economic change, notwithstanding uncertainty and irrespective of the diversity of values and preferences in society. In the face of current uncertainty, research is needed to provide guidance on how to develop a socially and economically justifiable mix of mitigation, adaptation and development policy, as well as on which elements would be part of such a mix. Moreover, research is needed to establish the conditions under which the process of mainstreaming can be most effective. Rather than actually developing and implementing specific mitigation and adaptation options, the objective of climate policy should be to facilitate such development and implementation as part of sectoral policies. Finally, analysis needs to focus on the optimal use and expected effectiveness of financial instruments, taking into account the mutual effects between these instruments on the one hand, and national and international sectoral investments and official development assistance on the other. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Concentrated solar power is a promising technique involving the deployment of hundreds or thousands of revolving mirrors used to focus solar energy on a column of liquid, which in turn generates steam for electric turbines. Climate change is one of several factors, including over withdrawal contributing to global water scarcity. The international energy system is in a state of constant change. Climate change’s direct impacts on energy systems and resources are likely to have more negative than positive impacts on the global supply of energy. Trends in the geopolitics of energy are raising a number of concerns. Vulnerabilities in energy production, trade and distribution systems are increasingly apparent. The rise in US energy production is considerable and it has boosted energy security. Energy demand in the power sector is likely to correlate more closely with demographic change. Instability in developing nations can affect energy systems in a variety of ways as institutions become less functional. © 2017 Robert E.

AB  - The catastrophe of air pollution is an alarming and pervasive global issue. It arises from the emission of harmful substances into the earth’s atmosphere, resulting in the contamination of the air that we breathe. This pollution primarily stems from human activities, including industrial processes, transportation, agriculture, and energy production. This paper examines the links between green investment, digitalization, renewable energy, export, and economic growth for a total of 30 organization for economic co-operation and development economies over the period between 1990 and 2020 to empirically probe the magnitude and the effect of green investment, economic growth, digitalization, export, and renewable energy on PM2.5 air pollution. We evaluated the panel for numerous diagnostic tests including a long-run co-integration link that is acknowledged among the variables under investigation. The superior econometric estimation method of moment quantiles regression validates that economic growth is inimical. At the same time, green investment, renewable energy, export, and digitalization illustrate heterogeneous effects on PM2.5 air pollution. Based on the findings, it is found that excluding economic growth, the explanatory variables effectively reduce PM2.5 air pollution in the organization for economic co-operation and development countries. Nonetheless, the extent of the green investment increases a proper inquiry which portrays a mitigating trend across the quantiles based on the outcomes, government, and policymakers should implement these policies and foster a holistic approach that combines green investment and digitalization, so that can significantly reduce PM2.5, protect public health, and promote sustainable economic growth. This approach not only addresses immediate environmental challenges but also positions our region as a leader in environmental stewardship and technological innovation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The concern of environmental degradation, poverty, and income inequality remains a priority in achieving sustainable development goals. Countries are trying to reduce income inequality, alleviate poverty, and reduce environmental degradation which needs special attention. Consequently, this study explores the effect of income inequality, poverty, and energy consumption on carbon dioxide emission in the Belt and Road Initiative countries from 1996 to 2018. By employing the generalized method of moments, the findings show that income inequality, poverty, and energy consumption significantly increase carbon dioxide emission and lead to environmental degradation, while access to electricity significantly raises environmental quality. Economic growth positively affects carbon dioxide emission; however, the environmental Kuznets curve is valid. Income inequality exerts a moderating effect on carbon dioxide emission via per capita economic growth that reduces environmental degradation in the Belt and Road Initiative countries. The results of this study give important policy implications for the Belt and Road Initiative countries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The climate variability in Pakistan adversely affects rice crops and undermines the food security and livelihoods of millions of rural households whose survival depends directly on rice farming. This study examines farmers’ risk perception, adaptation responses, and adaptation impact on rice productivity. We employed a multi-stage sampling method for selecting 480 farmers from the rice production zone of Punjab province, a region that produces more than 60% of the total rice in the country and faces significant production decline due to climate change. We used the risk matrix method to determine farmers’ perception of climate change-induced risk and used the propensity score matching (PSM) technique to analyze the impact of adaptation measures on rice yield and crop returns. Results show that farmers had high perceptions and were concerned about biological and financial risks, followed by biophysical, atmospheric, and social risks. Farmers applied supplementary irrigation, changed rice cultivation dates, changed rice varieties, resized farms, and altered irrigation application times as adaptation measures to cope with changing climate effects. Probit regression analysis showed that the adaptation measures had been largely affected by farmers’ socioeconomic attributes and risk perceptions. The PSM estimates showed that all adaptation measures had a positive impact on rice yield and crop return. Specifically, the cultivation of alternative rice varieties, farm resizing, and supplementary irrigation were the most effective strategies, followed by the adjustment in cultivation dates and irrigation time. Having implications beyond Pakistan, this study suggests improving farmers’ access to irrigation water, credit, and farm advisory services to facilitate the extent of adaptation.

AB  - Rising economic growth in recent ages is the primary concern of most of the countries to enhance the living standard, but the ever-increasing production of economic activities consumes a lot of energy, which leads to a sharp increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Innovation may be a remedy that can help improve energy efficiency, obtain renewable energy, and promote economic growth, thereby protecting the quality of the environment. Therefore, this paper examines the role of innovation and renewable energy consumption in CO2 reduction in OECD countries from 2004 to 2019. By using the two-step system generalized of moment estimator, the results show that economic growth and innovation significantly increase carbon emissions, however the innovation Claudia Curve (ICC) is verified, and the environmental Kuznets curve does not exist. Foreign direct investment has a negative impact on carbon emissions, thus verifying the Pollution Hao hypothesis, whereas renewable energy also improves environmental quality, but the interaction between innovation and renewable energy consumption still increases carbon emissions. Financial development, industrialization, trade, and energy consumption have also been found to be harmful factors of environmental quality. Our findings have considerable policy implications for OECD countries on the improvement of innovation indicators and investment in renewable energy sources to rise environmental quality. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Compound climate hazards, such as co-occurring temperature and precipitation extremes, substantially impact people and ecosystems. Internal climate variability combines with the forced global warming response to determine both the magnitude and spatial distribution of these events, and their consequences can propagate from one country to another via many pathways. We examine how exposure to compound climate hazards in one country is transmitted internationally via agricultural trade networks by analyzing a large ensemble of climate model simulations and comprehensive trade data of four crops (i.e. wheat, maize, rice and soya). Combinations of variability-driven climate patterns and existing global agricultural trade give rise to a wide range of possible outcomes in the current climate. In the most extreme simulated year, 20% or more of the caloric supply in nearly one third of the world’s countries are exposed to compound heat and precipitation hazards. Countries with low levels of diversification, both in the number of suppliers and the regional climates of those suppliers, are more likely to import higher fractions of calories (up to 93%) that are exposed to these compound hazards. Understanding how calories exposed to climate hazards are transmitted through agricultural trade networks in the current climate can contribute to improved anticipatory capacity for national governments, international trade policy, and agricultural-sector resilience. Our results highlight the need for concerted effort toward merging cutting-edge seasonal-to-decadal climate prediction with international trade analysis in support of a new era of anticipatory Anthropocene risk management. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Freshwater availability to meet the growing needs of humankind has raised serious concerns in the recent past. Two immediate responses to counter this challenge are efficient allocation of the scarce resources, and development and use of alternative sources of water. While 'water markets' are seen as a means to achieve efficient allocation of the scare resources, treated wastewater and low-quality water are now considered as potential sources of water to supplement the freshwater supplies. However, the latter option, that is use of reclaimed water as an alternative, imposes concerns regarding its suitability to sustain development. This is because of various issues related to wastewater usage and application. At the same time, it is also true that a successful and well-planned reuse scheme can help achieve sustainability as evidenced in some isolated cases around the world. In line with this, the current paper adopts a case-study approach to demonstrate how a successful reuse scheme in Adelaide, South Australia, has contributed to the sustainable development of the region. The paper looks into the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability and arrives at a conclusion that properly planned and managed reuse schemes backed with effective regulatory and policy measures can lead to sustainable development. © 2006 CIWEM.

AB  - The “green economy” is fast becoming the new alpha and omega for many policy makers, corporations, political actors, and NGOs who want to tackle both the environmental and economic crisis at once. Or would it be better to speak about “green capitalism?” Going green is not only important in the fight against environmental destruction, it also makes a country “stronger, healthier, safer, more innovative, competitive and respected,” argues Thomas Friedman, the well-known New York Times columnist. “Is there anything that is more patriotic, capitalist, and geostrategic than this?” Indeed, the rationale underlying the nascent project of the green economy is that if the market could become the instrument for tackling the environmental crisis, the fight against this crisis could be the royal road to solving the problems of the market. Focusing in particular on the green economy’s impact on climate change, this paper analyzes the green economy as a hegemonic project that tries to retranslate environmental concerns into a new jargon, and to turn environmental conflict into a new motor for economic development. © 2015 Union for Radical Political Economics.

AB  - Seafood is a crucial component of global food systems and plays a vital role in healthy diets and future food security, providing essential omega-3 fatty acids and micronutrients as well as incomes and livelihoods to millions of people. However, the seafood supply system is facing multiple contemporary global challenges that threaten its resilience as well as food security, livelihoods and ecological wellbeing. This opinion piece discusses the drivers of transformative change impacting seafood supply chains, with a particular focus on the UK, but the strategies described can be applied to many similarly developed countries. To address the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, escalating energy costs, climate change, risk management processes, and to ensure food security and resilience, active policy interventions are needed. Three key policy actions that policymakers can focus on are (i) sustainable seafood models, such as regenerative seafood systems and the circular economy, to improve both environmental and human health outcomes and the likelihood of meeting Sustainable Development Goals; (ii) promote local seafood as part of national food security to strengthen supply chains, support local communities, and enhance traceability and transparency; and, (iii) promote diversification in seafood sourcing and distribution to reduce pressure on critical stocks and increase the flexibility of food systems, while ensuring social and ecological protection. Building a more resilient and sustainable food system requires a holistic and integrated approach, alongside proactive collaboration, to address the multiple, complex, and long-term challenges facing the wider food system. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The so-called global economy has generated tremendous international wealth inequality that only increases as globalization deepens. This process is capped by the failure of classical economic theory to incorporate such free market externalities as negative capital. Negative capital can be defined as situations, events, or environmental conditions that degrade or threaten to degrade the standard of living or life expectancy of great numbers of persons, including those living in wealthy nations. These problems cut across issues of sovereignty and security, economic development, and the environment. They can be monetized and have value because the rich will have to pay in order to mitigate them, whether at home or abroad. Payment can take many forms, but it will involve a politics of redistribution. Negative capital is a systemic phenomenon "in nature" without which the classical economic theory is both incomplete and notably ideological. A tamed and therefore enlightened free market, that recognizes and addresses negative capital, may be better equipped to resolve the situations created by its inherent inadequacies.

AB  - The poor record of conventional development theories in reducing poverty in developing countries may result from the neglect of certain preconditions that are necessary before the people of a developing country are receptive to conventional economic stimuli. The basic needs approach, in its various forms, focuses on some of these requirements through its emphasis on human development and the recognition that economic development does not take place in a social vacuum. In this article a critical threshold of basic needs satisfaction is said to be a necessary, but not sufficient, precondition for economic development. Only if such a threshold has been achieved, will a population be receptive to those elements responsible for successful development in economically more-advanced societies. © 1984, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The agriculture sector, being highly vulnerable to climate change, plays a pivotal role in achieving green and sustainable economies. As the 2030 Agenda emphasizes the integrated development of environmental, social, and economic dimensions, it is crucial to understand how agricultural practices affect sustainability. This study investigates the environmental impact of the agricultural sector on the green economy by examining key environmental factors, such as agricultural energy emissions, environmental taxes, irrigated water use efficiency, fertilizer use, and pesticide application. The analysis is conducted using the Panel Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) model, with robustness checks performed through the comparison with the Panel ARDL model, using data from 2000 to 2020. To assess the green economy, an index is constructed based on 20 indicators related to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. The results show that agricultural energy emissions, despite their environmental cost, are positively associated with green economy development, highlighting the trade-off between high productivity and environmental degradation in a resource-efficient economy. Improved water use efficiency is found to enhance agricultural sustainability and production. Additionally, environmental taxes and regulations exert a significant positive effect on both environmental preservation and social welfare. Contrary to the belief that reducing agricultural production will lower carbon emissions, the study suggests that adopting environmentally friendly practices and imposing targeted taxes are more effective strategies. The findings also reveal a negative relationship between excessive fertilizer use and the green economy, indicating the need for minimal fertilizer application to promote sustainability. The study concludes with specific policy recommendations. Governments, particularly in countries that have not yet adopted sustainable agricultural practices, should implement environmental taxes and regulations to promote carbon neutrality and support the Sustainable Development Goals. These measures are essential to balancing economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social equity in the agricultural sector. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Punjab has emerged as an important rice-producing state in the country. The state with 1.53 per cent of the geographical area of the country produces more than 11 per cent of total rice production in the country. During the pre-globalization era, the production of rice in Punjab increased more than 10 times due to an increase in area and yield. The growth of a rice crop at such a high rate over 20 years in Punjab is indeed a rare phenomenon in the history of agricultural development in the world. During the post-globalization era, growth in area and yield slowed down as it already reached a plateau. Due to extensive cultivation of rice in Punjab, the state has been over-exploiting the groundwater, more than its recharge. Most of the tube-well dominated districts of the state, witnessed the fall in water table more than 20 to 30 cm per year. To dispose of the paddy straw, the farmers of Punjab generally opt for burning it. This practice of burning of paddy straw besides nutrient loss is posing a serious problem for the public health and transportation system. Rice has now become a problematic crop for Punjab state due to its ill effects on its natural resources, that is, the water and soil environmental degradation. The Punjab Agricultural University experts and other committees estimated that the total groundwater recharge from all sources can sustain/support only 16-17 lakh ha of paddy in Punjab. The area under the crop increased to 29 lakh ha which was unsustainable in the long run. The area under rice in Punjab should be stabilised at 16-17 lakh ha and the remaining paddy area should be shifted to other crops like pulses, oilseeds, maize, fruits and vegetables, etc. requiring less water, to achieve proper water balance. Thus diversification of some area from paddy is in the interest of Punjab farmers, State government and the Central government for long term food security on a sustainable basis. © 2019 The Society of Economics and Development.

AB  - The present financial constraint on UN activities is primarily of a developmental-rather than strategic, geopolitical-nature. It stems from such factors as: the blurring of the dichotomy between North and South; caution about intergovernmental cooperation which might reduce national sovereignty; and hesitation to accept the need for a fundamentally new development paradigm. Yet, strengthening of the UN is at the same time one of the critical conditions required for the international community effectively to address the growing problems of global poverty, socioeconomic inequity and environmental degradation. It is, therefore, imperative urgently to find a way out of the present political stalemate surrounding the UN's role. The present article suggests two possible steps forward: 1. (1) to shift the burden of financing the UN from national to global sources-by introducing charges for the use of global commons or levies on international activities such as trade and foreign currency transactions; 2. (2) to strengthen the UN's capacity to harmonize global policy priorities with global spending priorities-by creating under the UN's umbrella, an integrated international cooperation fund and an executive committee for ECOSOC. © 1995.

AB  - A systematic understanding of the dynamics of land consumption is extremely important for human well-being and especially vital for the ecological balance of the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region. Remarkable land use/land cover changes due to climate change, urbanization, and food demand have affected the spatio-temporal dynamics of built-up land footprints (BLFs) in SSA. By using spatial econometric techniques, this study investigates the spatio-temporal evolution and key drivers of built-up land footprints in 28 SSA countries from 2000 to 2017. Our results show how an appropriate consideration of the role of spatial effects can shed new insights into the convergence process of built-up land footprints. Foremost, the study reveals significant evidence of both absolute and conditional β convergence in BLFs over the experimental period. Additionally, the estimation indicates that biocapacity plays an important role in cutting built-up land footprints in SSA countries as there was a faster conditional convergence in countries with higher biocapacity. Moreover, the study outlined that the promotion of globalization and urbanization draws more pressure on the built-up environment and makes it challenging to reduce BLFs in SSA. In addition, this study found evidence for an inverted U-shaped nexus between per capita built-up land footprints and per capita gross domestic product (GDP), supporting the prediction of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The notion of international development has evolved giving new meanings to the discipline of development economics. This evolution has been the product of the flux in the global economy affecting both ‘developing’ and ‘developed’ countries. Three broad areas of concern are: First, the extent to which there is any type of consensus around which ‘current issues’ are most important—and why. Second, whether there is any consensus about the analytical methods which are appropriate for an understanding of the main characteristics of the ‘issues’ within economics or ‘political economy’. Third, whether there is any consensus about the nature of economic policies (and strategies) which can be used to address these issues effectively. There is need for a heterodox lens to address the mega-questions that both developed and developing countries will have to contend with in the next few decades: climate change; issues of development financing and cooperation; artificial intelligence, innovations and the world of work; pandemics and public health; population, migration and demographic dividends; human rights and (de)globalisation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to apply mathematical programming and welfare maximization theory to analyze the effect of population growth on agriculture/forest land use competition, per capita cash income and subsistence consumption from privately owned farms as a basis to determine the economic sustainability of the present farming systems in the West Usambara Mountains. Two working hypotheses are presented: (1) given present population growth trends, present farming systems are not economically sustainable; (2) population growth will cause deforestation over time due to the expansion of farmlands. The analysis presented in this paper indicates that the present farming systems can sustain the present population growth rate (2.1% per annum for Lukozi Village) and per capita income for a maximum duration of 25-30 years. Life expectancy in Tanzania is over 45 years (based on 1988 population census). Thus, the present farming systems cannot sustain even one human generation. This suggests that, for the existing farming systems to become economically sustainable, it is important to improve farming technology which could increase crop production through improvements of land productivity, and to increase income from other sources. Such a strategy will meet the increased food demand as a result of population growth as well as limiting the expansion of farmlands through forest clearing. In addition, the welfare of the farmers and rural populace could be enhanced and improved. Also, it might be relevant to expand small-scale industrial activities to increase income from off-farm activities.

AB  - There are increasing concerns that continued economic growth in high-income countries might not be environmentally sustainable, socially beneficial, or economically achievable. In this Review, we explore the rapidly advancing field of post-growth research, which has evolved in response to these concerns. The central idea of post-growth is to replace the goal of increasing GDP with the goal of improving human wellbeing within planetary boundaries. Key advances discussed in this Review include: the development of ecological macroeconomic models that test policies for managing without growth; understanding and reducing the growth dependencies that tie social welfare to increasing GDP in the current economy; and characterising the policies and provisioning systems that would allow resource use to be reduced while improving human wellbeing. Despite recent advances in post-growth research, important questions remain, such as the politics of transition, and transformations in the relationship between the Global North and the Global South. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - The realization of the economic and technical potential of climate mitigation policies in agriculture is influenced by how sociopolitical issues are considered in policy development and implementation. Based on a narrative review of the literature, this article provides an overview of common sociopolitical barriers facing supply-side and demand-side mitigation measures in agriculture. Understanding these sociopolitical issues can provide opportunities for the full realization of mitigation policy potentials. They are presented under four themes: local context, adoption capacity, and distributional impacts; food security, costs, and choices in food consumption; political considerations related to electoral weight and lobbying; and international aspects regarding emissions metrics, trade, and big agriculture. Designing complementary policies and second-best options, incorporating local knowledge in policy design, recognizing women's voice and role in sustainable agriculture, planning for job transitions, engaging stakeholders through multiscalar platforms, and appropriately framing and communicating policies in a digestible manner are some considerations to address these sociopolitical barriers.

AB  - Freshwater scarcity and unsustainable water use are just some of the growing concerns in many parts of the world. Increasing water demand accompanied by a changing climate can lead to unsustainable use of freshwater resulting in water scarcity. Several studies have quantified sustainable water use and water scarcity at a continental-to-global scale in the past. This review focuses on the large-scale water resources assessments and the methods by which sustainable water use and water scarcity are quantified. The review is structured based on a framework that comprises the main components of water demand and supply and other aspects of sustainable water use including virtual water trade and future projections of sustainable water use. The major components of water demand and supply in such assessments are increasingly derived from global earth system models and national-level census datasets. These assessments conclude that the selection of appropriate spatial and temporal scales is critical. The grid-based global earth system models enable better spatial resampling of water information across country/political boundaries. Similarly, by refining the temporal scale from annual (the most commonly used temporal scale of assessment) to monthly time steps, water scarcity is better captured due to the distinctive seasonality of water availability and demand. This paper also discusses the role of major drivers of water scarcity. Although both changing climate and increasing water demand contribute to water scarcity, the majority of the literature concludes that the demand-driven freshwater scarcity has a much greater impact than that induced by climate change. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Sustainable Development (SD) is a concept of socially inclusive approach, resource-efficient, with low-carbon measures bolstered by public and private investment partnerships in economic activities and infrastructural projects that minimizes carbon emissions pollution reductions, improves energy usage, and ultimately prevents the loss of biodiversity within the ecosystem services for humankind. Implementing SD policies is paradoxically challenging for a Nigeria and other African countries due to significant factors affecting the success of such policies and efforts within its economy. This study examined 11success factors (SFs) that affects SD in Nigeria's economy. The results show the huge impact of stakeholders on the success of the SD efforts in Nigeria. In addition, SD policy implementation, enforcement, and adaptability may take years or decades, but once embedded in overall economic sectors, organizational operations, and corporate social responsibilities, as well as the majority of the population's respective activities, the positive social, economic, and environmental sustainability impacts, will be profound. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Rapid deforestation is a major sustainability challenge, partly as the loss of carbon sinks exacerbates global climate change. In Cambodia, more than 13% of the total land area has been contracted out to foreign and domestic agribusinesses in the form of economic land concessions, causing rapid large-scale land use change and deforestation. Additionally, the distant drivers of local and global environmental change often remain invisible. Here, we identify hotspots of carbon loss between 1987-2017 using the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS and by comparing past and present land use and land cover. We also link global consumption and production patterns to their environmental effects in Cambodia by mapping the countries to which land-use embedded carbon are exported. We find that natural forests have decreased from 54%-21% between 1987 and 2017, mainly for the expansion of farmland and orchards, translating into 300 million tons of carbon lost, with loss rates over twice as high within economic land concessions. China is the largest importer of embedded carbon, mainly for rubber and sugarcane from Chinese agribusinesses. Cambodian investors have also negatively affected carbon pools through export-oriented products like rubber. The combined understanding of environmental change and trade flows makes it possible to identify distant drivers of deforestation, which is important for crafting more environmentally and socially responsible policies on national and transnational scales. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Wetlands in southern Africa continue to be degraded and lost through conversion to agriculture and other uses. One of the major constraints to sustainable management of wetlands in the region is that wetland users and decision-makers have insufficient understanding of the consequences of alternative management and policy regimes on wetland functioning, ecosystem services and human well-being. This study developed an ecological-economic model based on the system dynamics framework to simulate the impacts of alternative policy regimes on wetland functioning and economic well-being. Results showed that wetland services (crop production and natural resource harvesting) are inter-linked with trade-offs involved through their competition for labour, land and water resources. Policy scenario simulation results showed that diversifying livelihoods out of agriculture simultaneously improves economic well-being and enhances wetland conservation. Pure conservation strategies impose significant losses in the economic welfare of local population unless supported with diversification of livelihood sources. Government policies that support livelihood diversification into off-farm livelihood opportunities for the rural poor are critical for sustainable wetland management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The initial efforts and reforms for stabilization in Bolivia led to moderate but stable growth and some reduction in poverty during most of the 1990s. Towards the end of the decade, nearing the twenty-first century, growth slowed down and poverty increased again. Trade liberalization and capital inflows stimulated export growth and increased the propensity to import. Non-traditional exports took a larger share of overall exports, and exports were the primary source of growth in aggregate output during most of the 1990s. The export-led growth process continues to be based on natural resources, but includes both agricultural (e.g. soya beans) and processed mineral products (e.g. jewels) as new export items. The growth path has not proved to be very stable or sustainable. Performance of exports has been quite vulnerable to economic shocks in neighbouring countries. The growing share of non-traditional exports has been due primarily to the further collapse of traditional exports, particularly natural gas and petroleum products that depend on Argentinean and Brazilian markets. Growth in non-traditional exports has decelerated after 1999 and this has affected the overall growth of the economy. Unemployment rates have increased again to levels close to those recorded at the end of the 1980s, and new emergency employment programmes are being implemented to absorb the social cost of declining economic growth. Real labour income has not shown any increase in the second half of the 1990s, with unskilled workers being the most negatively affected. In 2000, real labour income of unskilled urban workers fell 20 per cent relative to the 1989 levels, while that of skilled urban workers rose approximately 20 per cent. Increased skill intensity and widening wage gaps are also reflected in rising per capita income inequality at the household level. Macro-micro CGE simulations show that the effects of trade liberalization and greater trade integration on aggregate employment and wages would counteract these outcomes. These positive wage and employment outcomes can only materialize, however, if Bolivia's major trading partners are able to emerge from their recessions. Bolivia's dependence on aid and its vulnerability to the volatility of the primary goods markets has not disappeared despite almost two decades of economic reforms. The introduction of social protection programmes provided but small compensation for the economic shocks to which so many Bolivian households remain vulnerable. © 2006 Rob Vos, Enrique Ganuza, Samuel Morley and Sherman Robinson.

AB  - Rapid urbanization improves socioeconomic development but challenges ecosystem sustainability. Meanwhile, the gradient responses of ecosystem services (ESs) to landscape structures and associated regime shifts of the agriculture–ecosystem–economy nexus (AEEN) have not been sufficiently addressed, preventing an effective balance between socioeconomic prosperity and ecosystem conservation. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study selected the Guangdong Province of southeastern China to explore landscape dynamics from 1985 to 2020 and their spatially heterogeneous impacts on ESs and the AEEN, based on Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs approach and other biophysical models as well as statistical records about socioeconomic factors. AEEN elements, including ESs, responded directly to policy adjustments in terms of ecosystem restoration and landscape management and presented remarkable regime shifts (i.e., phase changes) and spatial heterogeneity. Aggressive agricultural reclamation before 1999 increased crop productivity but caused vegetation degradation and biomass decline. Accelerated urban expansion and ecosystem restoration efforts have improved economic and ecological benefits but have substantially reduced crop productivity and threatened food security. However, timely policy adjustments since 2009 reversed the declining trend and maintained the grain supply. Landscape composition presented patterns of gradual decline along the urban–rural gradient, which in turn determined ES gradient patterns. For instance, water yield and nitrogen export positively correlated with each other (p < 0.0001) but negatively correlated with other ESs. Our study enriches the understandings of social–ecological systems’ response to man-made interventions from AEEN perspective allowing for spatial variabilities and regime shifts, which support policy formulation for coordinating ecological and economic benefits.

AB  - As the globe faces urgent environmental concerns and the need to move toward a greener and more sustainable economy, the idea of sustainability has received a lot of attention recently. Evaluation of the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and natural resource management (NRM) policy options are crucial given the urgent environmental issues the world is facing and the requirement for sustainable development. The objective of this study is to assess China's ESG performance and NRM policy options in the dual carbon era for developing green economy. The dual carbon places a focus on the need of lessening carbon emissions and encouraging low-carbon activities and technologies. A hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods i.e. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)-GREY are used to evaluate and prioritize the criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. The FAHP method is used to assess the criteria and sub-criteria of ESG performance. Moreover, the TOPSIS-Grey method is employed to prioritize the NRM policy options. The findings of FAHP analysis reveal that environment is the most crucial criteria, followed by governance and social performance. While the TOPSIS-Grey analysis show that green finance and investment, policy and regulatory reforms, and circular economy practices are the most suitable NRM policy options. China can significantly advance toward a more ecologically and socially responsible future while fostering economic growth and prosperity in the dual carbon era by implementing the recommended sustainable practices and policies. © 2023

AB  - The prime objective of this research is to explore the impacts of import and export diversification and renewable energy on environmental footprints. In doing so, the authors employ the data of trade diversification, income inequality, renewable energy, and ecological footprints for 17 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries covering the period of 1995–2019. In econometric framework, the authors use two baseline empirical models based on key indicators such as trade (exports and imports) diversification index, income inequality, renewable energy, and globalization. The empirical analysis from both specifications suggests a cointegrating relation between the key variables of interest. The Long-run empirical estimates from FMOLS, and DOLS methods indicate that income inequality and import diversification increase ecological issues while globalization and exports diversification abate it. Further analysis through Granger causality highlights unilateral causal relationships running from renewable energy consumption to imports diversification, and from ecological footprint to imports diversification. The conclusions of this study stress the importance of harmonic policies, synchronization in trade, energy and resource consumption in achieving sustainable development goals. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Since China has the largest population in the world, the available water resources per capita in China are very limited. With the rapid economic development that is currently occurring, the shortage of water resources at the national level has become extremely critical. How to solve the problems due to water scarcity and water pollution has received increasing attention from the Chinese government and various communities. In order to provide a sustainable development environment for 1.6 billion people in the future, the whole country has started to reform urban water resources management systems in terms of related policies, regulations, methodologies, and technologies focusing on improving the efficiency and effectiveness in water use. Urban water quota management has now become a core strategy in developing a water resources governance model for water demand management aiming at establishing a water-saving society. This paper introduces the main stages and the processes of implementing water quota management in China, analyzes the basic principles, and expounds the elements, information foundation, core module and operational model of the urban water quota management system. It has been demonstrated that urban water quota management has made some remarkable contribution not only in transforming the pattern of water mode and strengthening water management enforcement but also in integrating various management methods in saving water and preventing pollution. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2010.

AB  - The Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), characterized by its dense population and dynamic industrial activities, is facing unprecedented challenges in balancing water resource utilization with environmental protection. Understanding the interplay between water environment and economic development is crucial for the YREB. In this study, the dynamics of sustainable state and driving mechanism for water utilization examined from a Water Footprint (WF) perspective at regional and sectoral scales from 2002 to 2017. The analysis is facilitated by a novel framework that integrates WF sustainability and equilibrium assessment for water pollution and scarcity stresses with structural decomposition analysis (SDA), based on multiregional input-output (MRIO) dataset. The results reveal that the YREB had an extremely high grey WF (GWF), approximately nine times higher than the blue WF (BWF), yet has consistently decreased by 210.00 billion m3 during 2002–2017, indicating a greater but mitigated stress from water pollution compared to water scarcity. Our analysis shows an increase in the Sustainability Index (SI) of YREB from 0.3706 to 0.4435, primarily due to the reduction in GWF. Water use equality among the three major sectors has also improved. The decomposition results highlight that water conservation and treatment technologies have the most significant impact on reducing WFs, followed by shifts in consumption patterns and adjustments in industry structure, all of which enhance the water sustainability of the YREB. This study underscores the critical role of water pollution control in ensuring sustainable water resource use, as reducing pollution loads supports responsible water exploitation, leading to improved water quality and optimized resource efficiency.

AB  - Sustainability in aquaculture or agriculture production is depended on its successive use of natural resources that can ensure economic increment and sustainability of the livelihood of people. The objective of the study was to find out suitable combination of rice-fish-vegetable to be cultured in rainfed rice field. Two experiments were conducted for 4 months under rainfed condition. Two rice varieties (BRRI-51 and BRRI-52), three different fish species. i.e., Cyprinus carpio var. communis, Barbonymus gonionotus and Oreochromis niloticus and two combinations of vegetables (Red amaranth + Indian spinach and Cucumber + Water spinach) were selected for these experiments. Significantly higher growth and production performance of fish, B. gonionotus were recorded in both of the experiments. Furthermore, between the rice varieties, BRRI-52 showed significantly higher grain yield, biological yield and harvest index. However, vegetable combination did not show any significant difference between the experiment. Finally, considering economic performance, integration of BRRI-52, B. gonionotus and Cucumber-spinach combinations was provided significantly higher net benefit and benefit-cost ratio (BCR). Therefore, combination of rice-fish-vegetable BRRI-52, B. gonionotus and Cucumber-spinach is recommended to improve food security and sustainability for resource-limited farmers in rainfed rice field. Rice-fish-vegetable integrated culture could address the sustainable development goals (SDG) and therefore policy implications should be considered for institutional support, technical facilities and extension services to increase the knowledge of farmers and to uplift the productivity and profitability. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Rebalancing growth in favor of domestic consumption has been an objective of Chinese policy makers for over two decades. However, until recently little progress has been achieved. This article argues that the nature of the demand regime is a major reason for the limited rebalancing operated thus far. Until the great recession (2008–09), Chinese growth was profit-led, which means that an increase in the profit share of income had a positive effect on investment and net exports that exceeded the negative effect on consumption. The fact that the profit share increased by 10 percentage points explains why the rate of growth boomed over the 1996–2007 period. We show that after the great recession, China’s demand regime turned wage-led, which means that an increase in the wage share results in a positive effect on households’ consumption which exceeds the negative effect on investment and net exports. The conclusion is that a pro-labor policy may now contribute to rebalance China’s growth and make it less dependent on exports, overinvestment and carbon-intensive industries. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - To meet the challenges related to global warming, transition to low carbon technologies are underway in most economic activities. Government energy and climate policies are the core to achieve the target of limiting the rise in global temperature to well below 2°C, as set out in the Paris Agreement. Besides, low carbon technologies cannot only help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also contribute to job creation, nation's competitiveness, and improvement of air quality. Thus, the co-benefits (externalities) should also be monetarized in order to be able to compare them to the costs and benefits already expressed in currency and support the decision making process of policy makers and public authorities. Natural gas and renewable gas are identified as one of the most efficient alternative fuels in the transport sector with benefits like: less emissions of greenhouse gases, less emissions of air pollutions, lower noises as well as the job creation in emerging sectors around NGV (natural gas vehicle) and trade balance of energy import. A topic of Working Group 5.3 of IGU (International Gas Union) has been to build a tool to monetarize the co-benefits of NGV development with combining environmental, social and economic impacts to allow members to simulate their national cases. © 27th World Gas Conference, WGC 2018.

AB  - The urban road transport sector in India currently faces the challenge of increased travel demand, increased use of private vehicles, traffic congestion as well as alarming levels of air pollution. The consequent public health problems, energy insecurity resulting from oil imports and pressure to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from the sector have also emerged as serious challenges for the country. Many cities in the world are considering electric buses for public transport as one of the potential solutions to address these issues. This article analyses the feasibility of introducing electric buses in the public transport fleet by estimating the financial burden that such a shift may entail, and the corresponding emissions it would mitigate. It also provides a methodology and illustrates the same for a city in India. The results indicate that while electric buses may not be financially viable at present and require state support and subsidies for operation, careful planning and phased implementation would make them a promising option for the future. The cost analysis indicates that for the immediate future, the replacement of air-conditioned diesel buses with similar electric buses in the fleet makes better economic sense. However, it is necessary to determine how the increased cost of using electric buses is to be distributed across the population of the city to avoid disproportionately burdening one section, i.e. bus commuters, with the cost of cleaning up the city's air. © 2022.

AB  - Indonesia, the world's largest archipelagic nation and second-largest fish producer in the world, has fisheries distinguished by a high diversity of species and with a large variety of gear and methods used to fish over expansive geographic areas. Fisheries management in Indonesia is equally complex with multiple levels of governance, decentralization, and traditional fishing tenure rights. The Government of Indonesia is taking strides to improve fisheries management in a changing and complex environment to support sustainable economic development, livelihoods, and food security of its people. This paper takes stock of recent developments in fisheries science and management in the country and identifies additional opportunities for improvement. An analytic framework for evaluating progress and opportunities for fisheries management has been adapted from a set of eight working principles for effective fisheries management. Analysis of each principle revealed that although current Indonesian fishery management includes landing data collections, onboard observer programs, logbooks, e-logbooks, catch per unit effort (CPUE) standardization, regional fisheries management units, genetic assessments, vessel tracking, and similar tools to improve fisheries management, significant work remains. Although the use of data is pivotal in the development of fisheries solutions, data inputs are still not adequate to perform fully reliable assessments. Indonesia's pool of experts remains insufficient to meet the extensive stock assessment needs across the country and thus continuous training and mentoring of assessors in techniques relevant for different stock types and data levels is crucial to ensure skills enhancement. Indonesia's interdisciplinary stock assessment review body, Komnas KAJISKAN, plays a critical role by providing scientific guidance that balances short-term economic needs from the perspectives of fishers and policymakers with the ecological constraints required for long-term fishery sustainability. Although small-scale fisheries dominate Indonesia's fisheries management system, the process of decentralizing data collection and management functions to province, district, and village levels is alone not sufficient to encourage more local ownership and compliance. Tools such as customary rules of conduct, marine protected areas, and other local area management regimes can also help to successfully manage small-scale fisheries and marine resources. Provincial licensing and boat classifications remain issues that require continued attention, simplification, and clarification. Finally, an enhanced national policy framework that empowers and engages local governments, universities, NGOs, fishers and community groups who are adequately trained, staffed, and funded would significantly strengthen fisheries science through improved data collection, processing, and interpretation to benefit management. In conclusion, the threat of overfishing in Indonesia's fisheries is visible in the data, and trends suggest a similar pathway involving unsustainable production goals and escalating overfishing as followed by neighboring countries that experienced fisheries collapse. Time is of the essence in recognizing this trajectory and adjusting policies to maintain and sustain the country's natural fisheries wealth for the present and future generations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The role of food security has continuously been increasing during the recent decades and especially due to recent crises. This study investigates the determinants of food security in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia—regions that are critical to global food security due to their substantial population and agricultural output. Utilising a dataset spanning from 2001 to 2021 and employing a random effects regression model, this paper examines the influence of economic growth, agricultural performance, open economic activities, climate change, and crisis situations on food security. The study covers 357 observations from 17 countries within the selected regions. Results suggest that the relationship between economic growth and food security is not straightforward across the regions. While agricultural performance generally supports food security, the impact of open economic activities and external shocks like conflicts and climate change vary. Notably, recent global crises have had nuanced effects on food security, while the prevalence of undernourishment steadily decreased despite of the crisis events. The study highlights the complexity of achieving food security in Asia and the need for sustainable region-specific policies addressing both structural and transitory challenges. Policymakers need to consider a broader range of factors, related to sustainability, to effectively combat hunger and undernutrition. © 2024 by the author(s).

AB  - In our built environment, societal production of energy and clean water is inextricably linked to the natural resources from which they are derived. Acknowledgement and consideration of the coupling of energy, water, and the environment (the energy–water–environment nexus) will be critical to a sustainable future. This is particularly true as we transition away from historical energy sources (e.g., coal, petroleum, natural gas) and into the widespread adaptation of renewable energy (RE) sources (e.g., solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, bioenergy) as a strategy to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and consequently slow global climate change. This transition is fraught with both challenges and opportunities at the county, state, national, and international levels, as addressing future societal needs with respect to energy and water, and the environment requires recognition of their interdependence and development of new technologies and societal practices. In this study, the focus is on the RE–water–environment (REWE) nexus. In California, the REWE nexus is becoming increasingly important in achieving 100% clean electricity from eligible RE and zero-carbon resources by 2045 and in the face of climate change and population and economic growth. In this context, California’s RE deployment and renewable electrical generation, its RE legislative information, REWE nexus, and intertwined REWE nexus challenges and opportunities in California (e.g., administrative–legal, technology development, digitalization, and end-of-life RE waste) are comprehensively discussed to identify the knowledge gaps in this nexus and solutions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The Lower Mekong River Basin of Southeast Asia is at an important juncture in its path of development. The natural resource base upon which future development will depend is being undermined by deforestation. Poverty in many places in the basin provides few options other than continued use of the forests for fuelwood, slash-and burn agriculture, as well as commercial uses. The Mekong River holds great potential in helping meet the region's energy and food requirements, especially given the low level of water development in the basin. It is generally accepted that any development program must account for a range of socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. The record of wafer development projects in the basin holds clues about their strengths and weaknesses in promoting environmentally-and socially-responsible development. Reviewing past work also shows how the emphasis of wafer development programs has changed during the past two to three decades. A review of the contemporary work program of the Mekong Committee and Secretariat reflects the extent to which they have learned such lessons and. in turn, their potential for contributing to more sustainable development in the basin. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Oil has played a crucial role in the global economy since its discovery in the mid-19th century. Due to technological advancements, oil became a crucial energy source in the 20th century, and its demand has risen in tandem with economic advancements since its discovery (Fattouh et al., 2019). Apart from oil being crucial for modern transportation, as the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2018, p. 12) stated, "most items created today, from apparel to autos to agricultural inputs to medical stockpiles are all derived from fossil- fuel by-products". As per OPEC (2004) estimates, over the 20th and into the 21st centuries, industrial production of oil increased by roughly fifty (50) folds. Hence, oil was dubbed as the "lifeblood" of modern civilisation, and affectionately referred to as the "black gold" by industry players. And during this period fossil-fuels (oil, gas and coal) have been the most critical energy source available globally (Bahgat, 2003).Fossil- fuels supplied more than 85% of the total energy supplied or consumed in 2019 globally (IEA, 2019).As a result of being crucial to modern society and a key energy source globally, oil and gas have become a huge geopolitical tool. Oil reserves, price, ownership, and accompanying riches all have had an impact on global economics and geopolitics. The Paris Accord is a legally binding global treaty on climate change that was signed by 196 territories to "limit global warming to below 2°C, preferably 1.5°C, in contrast to pre-industrial levels". To remain within the global carbon emission targets, a sturdy energy transition with a reduction in fossil-fuel demand is needed (Rogelj et al., 2019). The Accord should serve as motivation for IOCs to adapt their corporate strategies to the evolving ecosystem of the energy transition. But the IOCs' response, meanwhile, has been quite inconsistent up to this point. Some have refused to set concrete aims, and are spending more on initiatives that contradict the Paris goals and objectives (UNFCCC, 2016). Theenergy demand is expected to continue to rise as societies advance and citizens seek out an improved living standard.In 2017, energy demand soared, with fossil-fuels accounting for more than 80% of the energy mix.Hence, the want for "more energy and less carbon" is a doublesocial dilemma (BP, 2018: IEA, 2018). The emergence of issues regarding global warming, climate change, and the rise of the low-carbon economy has generated added pressure on states and corporations to reduce their carbon footprint (i.e. decarbonise) activities within their economies and corporations. It has become a change agenda to address issues regarding climate change, and this is due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) from carbon- intensive fossil- fuel sources that have fuelled global economies for centuries. Hence,the need for profound changes to infrastructure, technologies, and behaviour to help reduce emissions. Failure to put these in place will escalate among others the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts on ecologies, that will threaten water security, livelihoods, agricultural production, and economic growth globally(OECD, 2013a; 2012).A prime example is the transition from a pre-industrial system built on water, traditional biomass, wind, and muscular ability to an industrial era marked by pervasive mechanisation, steam power, and coal (Grubler, 2012).This study aims to assess the shift in corporate strategy regarding factors arising due to the energy transition and how it is redefining corporate strategy. As stated, IOCs can't ignore energy transition, and corporate strategy is needed to adapt for future survival (Stevens, 2016). Copyright 2024, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - The author explores the evolving multidimensional nature of challenges in food security by gauging the current turbulence in international affairs, the magni-tude of conflicts, the global pandemic, and the economic recession daunting the lives of people across the globe. The relationship between different food security measures and their relationship with political, economic, and agricultural factors remains underexplored. The author attempts to fill this lacuna in the existing body of literature by contextualizing the issue from an interdisciplinary approach, spanning ecological, sociological, economic as well and geopolitical aspects. Resilient Food Systems, Sustainable Agriculture, and Climate Action are the core agenda of the 2023 UN Climate Change Conference COP28 summit, and this chapter revolves around this theme, by piecing together the interdependencies within food systems from a multidimensional perspective. A thought-provoking discussion from a gender lens by focusing on interventions required from different stakeholders. This chapter aims to draw diverse disciplinary perspectives to critically evaluate the political economy of food systems besides advocating for affirmative policy from a gender lens. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - A combination of rapid population growth, climate change, and environmental degradation have placed immense pressure on global food sources and increased food security concerns especially in developing economies like those of African countries. Notably, efforts to produce food for the rising human population have continued to burden arable lands across the globe, necessitating heavy use of chemical fertilizers to increase crop yield. While the widespread use of conventional fertilizers has indeed enhanced crop productivity, its sustainability is threatened by rapid soil degradation and rising environmental concerns resulting from chemical compound accumulation across several ecosystems. The invention of nanotechnology, which is the synthesis and manipulation of materials at the nanometer (1 to 100 nm) range, promises potential solutions to these agricultural sustainability challenges. Specifically, theoretical, and experimental research on nanofertilizers have highlighted significant potential for their employment in sustainable farming practices. The current review examines the benefits conferred by the delivery of nutrients to plants at the nanoscale, outlining the progress, challenges, and opportunities for adopting this emerging technology by African countries, and highlighting future perspectives and areas of possible collaborations globally. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The year 2022 has been a difficult one for the European energy sector with high energy prices for the average consumer and an uncertain path forward. The European Union was forced to take measures for ensuring the energy security of the continent and accelerate the green transition with renewable energy sources widely regarded as the only way forward. European citizens, though concerned about climate change and the negative impact of fossil fuels, were forced to search for alternatives that would enable them to heat their homes during the winter and in consideration of the looming threat of blackouts and the uncertainties brought about by the war in Ukraine. The sustainable development of Europe’s energy sector and the transition away from fossil fuels is at the crossroads and the European Union seems determined to head down the path toward renewable and sustainable development. This article discusses the challenges and opportunities of sustainable development in the energy sector in Europe, with a focus on Romania. Climate change and the negative impact of the energy sector are highlighted, along with the need for a fair and just transition to clean energy. The European Green Deal, REPowerEU plan, Mechanism for a Just Transition, and Carbon Dioxide Emission Border Adjustment Mechanism are discussed as policies to promote sustainable development. The article emphasizes the need for effective public policies and the establishment of green jobs and technology in the industry to mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure a just transition to renewable energy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - As Asia faces the dual challenges of rapid economic expansion and mounting environmental pressures, the region's ability to balance growth with sustainability has become a focal point of global discourse. With increasing energy demands, escalating CO₂ emissions, and widening income inequality, an integrated approach to managing natural resources has never been more critical. This study responds to this urgent need by examining the complex interplay between energy consumption, living standards, and natural resource rents—factors that will determine whether Asia can sustain its growth without depleting its ecological assets. Our analysis incorporates key variables such as standard of living, income inequality, renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption, CO₂ emissions, gross fixed capital formation, and foreign direct investment, all of which play crucial roles in shaping natural resource rents across Asian economies. Using Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR), we uncover nuanced insights into how these factors interact across different economic contexts. The findings reveal a negative correlation between higher living standards and resource rents, indicating that countries like Japan and South Korea, which have transitioned to more diversified, technology-driven sectors, demonstrate a pathway for sustainable growth. Conversely, economies like Indonesia and Malaysia, with lower living standards and higher dependence on resource rents, face challenges related to income inequality and environmental degradation. Renewable energy consumption positively impacts resource rents, while reliance on fossil fuels has a detrimental effect, reinforcing the need for energy portfolio diversification. A strong link between CO₂ emissions and resource rents highlights the necessity of balancing economic growth with environmental preservation. This study provides policymakers with actionable insights, emphasizing the importance of adopting sustainable energy practices, addressing income inequality, and managing foreign investments responsibly to ensure long-term resilience and prosperity in Asian economies while safeguarding vital natural resources for future generations. © 2024

AB  - Forest ecosystems are increasingly subject to disturbances, such as extreme (climate) events, fires and pathological outbreaks, which exert significant (and still poorly quantified) economic impacts, despite their intrinsic resilience. How forest management addresses these challenges will have profound effects on human health, environmental diversity, (ecological and economic) productivity and the ability of forest ecosystems to recovery from exogenous shocks. Assuming forests as ensuring ecosystem services that are vital to society and human well-being, in addition to providing wood material, a better knowledge of forest ecosystems appears a key requirement to delineate a developmental strategy that guarantees environmental protection objectives and achievement of climate and energy targets. In the context of Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the information available on forest management practices in Europe still seems not completely suitable to provide a comprehensive overview of ecosystem conditions, their economic value, and their biodiversity. Based on a literature review, the present contribution focuses on recent dynamics of the forestry sector in Europe, delineating the inherent complexity in the environmental-economic nexus. Additionally, the extensive use of a key natural resource such as wood exerts social implications for local districts adapting to ecological change—from climate warming to landscape transformations. In line with earlier studies, our paper confirms the role of the technical-economic dimension of forestry in sustainable development paths of districts and regions, affecting together (i) short-term economic dynamics, (ii) the growth prospects of the sector, (iii) the organization of the supply chain, (iv) the interconnections between companies, and (v) investment strategies at large. One of the major issues is the low reliability of official statistics to provide a coherent picture of the actual status of forest resources. At the same time, forestry practices are pivotal in maintaining habitats and species while increasing the timber production that remains (too) sustainable. This is the policy direction constantly given by the European Commission to stimulate over time public bodies and private (in whose hands is about 60% of European forests) to start virtuous paths in the circular economy with considerable repercussions in terms of additional jobs, recycled materials, mt of CO2 equivalent avoided, and increase in community added value. In this context, forestry should assure a more ‘holistic’ contribution to sustainable development paths at various spatial scales. This means concentrating on both economic and environmental targets based on the identification of significant (ecological-economic) dimensions that may delineate future lines of investigation and policy intervention, while increasing between member countries and regional authorities. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The study examined the role of agricultural cooperatives in strengthening the resilience and social fabric of rural communities in the Kita and Yanfolila regions of Mali. Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, data was collected from 149 participants, including cooperative members and non-members, through structured surveys and focus group discussions. It explored the challenges faced by farmers, the benefits of cooperative membership, the dynamics of social cohesion within these cooperatives, the nuances of inclusion, and conducted a comparative analysis between cooperative members and non-members. The communities in Kita and Yanfolila faced multiple adversities that significantly affected their resilience, livelihoods and overall well-being. Drought emerged as the most serious problem, affecting the entire population and underscoring its profound impact on agriculture and welfare. Flooding was also a significant threat, exacerbating food insecurity. While terrorist activities and COVID-19 seemed less pressing due to their limited occurrence or awareness at the time, vigilance and awareness remained key. The study highlighted the myriad benefits of cooperative membership and how it empowered members through agricultural training, access to resources and financial stability. In particular, cooperatives have been instrumental in addressing water scarcity and ensuring sustainable access through initiatives such as boreholes and pumping equipment, thereby increasing agricultural productivity and food security. The study also highlighted the key role of cooperatives in fostering social cohesion, promoting conflict resolution and serving as networking platforms. Members praised cooperatives for providing emotional and material support in times of need, disseminating conflict management techniques and promoting transparent, collective decision-making processes. However, there was a noticeable gap in perceptions between cooperative members and non-members regarding the role of cooperatives in conflict resolution. Non-members were less confident, possibly due to a lack of exposure or understanding of cooperative mechanisms. Inclusivity emerged as a key issue, with discussions highlighting the challenge of extending benefits to nonmembers, which could lead to feelings of exclusion. Income disparities between members and non-members further exacerbated issues of social cohesion. The study also highlighted the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing disrupted supply chains, reduced incomes, increased unemployment and heightened food insecurity in rural communities. Despite this, agricultural cooperatives stepped up by disseminating information, distributing essential supplies and promoting hygiene practices. © (2024), All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the mountain food systems in the Hindu Kush Karakoram Pamir Landscape (HKPL) in Pakistan. It analyzed the impacts of climate change on agriculture and livestock and identified key opportunities which can be tapped into to improve sustainability in food systems. The study applied a “multiple case studies approach” and collected data from four study sites at different altitudes, using the method of slow focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and non-participant observation. Findings revealed that the contribution of local agriculture and livestock to people’s food consumption has gradually declined, increasing their dependence on external food items. Local food systems are losing diversity, which has negatively impacted people’s dietary diversity. The youth has lost interest in agriculture due to low productivity and profitability in a high altitude village—Misgar (≈3200 m above sea level). In all sites, local people perceived mixed impacts (both positive and negative) of climate change on food systems. Climate change together with enhanced use of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers, high yielding seed, and improved farm management have positive, and climate-attributed increase in crop pest attacks has negative impact on crop productivity. Moreover, local people perceived negative impacts of climate change on pastures and water availability in traditional irrigation systems without significant influence on crop and livestock productivity. In food systems, these are needed to maximize benefits from the local potential for organic production, livestock integration, value chain development, traditional food crops, medicinal plants, and protected vegetables cultivation to reduce the vulnerability of food systems to climactic and economic shocks, and improve the sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In the wake of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR6 report, there is escalating certainty regarding anthropogenic climate change and its concomitant uncertainties impacting corporate risk profiles and global financial stability. The lack of comprehensive climate risk identification contributes to this uncertainty. Despite its significance as a major global exporter, the Taiwanese electronics industry faces a significant empirical research gap regarding the corporate-level impacts of climate risks, resulting in an ambiguous risk landscape. Literature indicates that research related to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is still in its nascent stage, particularly in corporations’ strategic implementation of climate risk management. More climate risk identification is needed within this strategic domain to improve climate risk management. Based on the TCFD’s risk classification framework, we employed thematic analysis to identify 49 risk events within Taiwan’s electronics industry, thereby expanding the TCFD’s original list of risks and introducing a new category–climate risk events. Following this categorization, we applied the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to prioritize the materiality of these climate risk events. Subsequently, we incorporated vulnerability analysis to underscore its criticality in corporate climate risk management. This study highlights that acute physical risks, particularly power outages and water scarcity, dominate climate risk concerns within Taiwan’s electronics industry, whereas transition risks remain largely underestimated in corporate risk assessments. Furthermore, the findings reveal that vulnerability, measured through disclosure gaps, has a limited yet notable impact on risk prioritization, underscoring the need for more transparent and standardized climate risk reporting. By integrating hierarchical classification, materiality assessment, and vulnerability analysis, this study provides empirical evidence to support Taiwanese policymakers and industry practitioners in refining climate risk disclosure frameworks and strengthening corporate resilience strategies. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Agricultural productivity in China is a fundamental driver of food security and economic growth. Yet, the sector faces profound challenges due to environmental degradation and climate change, which threaten sustainable agricultural practices. This research examines the effects of technological innovations on agricultural Total Factor Productivity and environmental sustainability in China from 2012 to 2022. The study seeks to understand how technological advancements, when considered alongside socioeconomic variables, impact agricultural output while balancing ecological integrity. Employing a comprehensive methodological framework, this research integrates fixed-effects, random-effects, and multilevel mixed-effects models to analyze crucial factors including rural education, technological capability, and environmental conservation initiatives. The study further utilizes structural equation modeling to evaluate both the direct and indirect effects of these determinants on productivity. The results demonstrate that technological innovations substantially enhance agricultural productivity, particularly in provinces with higher socioeconomic development. Additionally, sustainable farming practices and tailored policy interventions are identified as vital in addressing regional productivity imbalances. The research concludes by underscoring the necessity for the continued integration of environmental considerations and emerging technologies to ensure the sustainability of agricultural growth in the long term. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the sub-national scale requires contextual insights and localized implementation. This study utilizes Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to assess SDG progress and interactions in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) metropolitan region of China. Population growth, economic development, and rapid urbanization are key drivers, exerting pressures on energy and water consumption, pollutant discharges, transportation, environmental degradation, and disaster management. The results reveal varied progress in nine goals intrinsic to this metropolitan context, with notable progress in energy and water consumption, and employment (Goals 7, 8, and 3). While moderate progress is evidenced in poverty reduction, economic growth, healthcare services, social security, access to potable water, water quality (Goals 1 and 6), challenges remain in transportation, waste generation, air quality, forest management, and disaster response (Goals 9, 11, and 15). Furthermore, target interaction analysis suggests that initiatives in high-leverage areas - ecosystem and environmental protection, equal access to resources and basic services, and climate change response - can yield substantial systemic impacts. However, poverty reduction, access to resources and basic services, ecosystem protection, and economic growth appear more dependent on system-wide efforts. By leveraging the DPSIR model, this context-sensitive SDG assessment accentuates priority zones and offers valuable perspective for cohesive SDG strategy formation and policy-making in dynamically growing metropolitan areas globally. © 2023

AB  - The transboundary flow of resource elements has resulted in unprecedented transfers of environmental and social impacts, inevitably influencing a region's environmental carrying capacity and sustainability. Consequently, evaluating the effects of both internal and external resource elements on regional sustainability is crucial for advancing sustainable development. This study distinguishes between internal and external resource elements that support the development of China's coastal areas, based on local coupling and telecoupling theories. It employs the emergy analysis method to assess the degree of dependence of these coastal areas on external resource elements, as well as the environmental loading pressures resulting from both internal and external resource elements and evaluates the sustainability of China's coastal regions. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of environmental load pressure were analyzed using the Local Indicators of Spatial Association time path, while the driving forces affecting sustainability were examined through the Logarithmic Mean Divis Index method. The results indicate that social development in China's coastal areas increasingly relies on external resource elements. In Hebei, Liaoning, and Shandong, the environmental load pressure primarily arises from the utilization of internal resources, whereas in Tianjin and Shanghai, it mainly stems from external resources. Overall, the sustainability of China's coastal areas is trending downward. Enhancing emergy intensity, promoting sustainable resource use, and reducing reliance on imported resources can contribute to improved sustainability. Finally, several actionable suggestions are provided. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cultivated land is the most valuable agricultural resource and the most important factor of production. The protection of cultivated land quality is not only the foundation of national food security but also a strategic issue related to the sustainable development of the economy and society as a whole. This paper uses survey data from Jiangxi Province’s “Double Hundred and Thousand” in 2023 and empirically analyzes the impact of digital literacy on farmers’ cultivated land quality protection behaviors and its mechanism by using the O-probit model and the mediating effect model. The results show that digital literacy can effectively promote farmers’ cultivated land quality protection behaviors. Furthermore, digital literacy can indirectly promote farmers’ cultivated land quality protection behaviors through cultivated land protection cognition and digital use ability. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that farmers are more inclined to participate in cultivated quality protection behaviors In the context of better soil fertility conditions and higher digital literacy. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously improve the digital literacy of farmers, improve their awareness of cultivated land protection, and continuously strengthen their digital use ability. © 2025 Shuang Hu, Huogen Wang.

AB  - The influence of water utilization on economic growth is depicted through a growth model that includes this congestible public good as a productive input for private producers. Growth is negatively affected by the government's appropriation of output to supply water but positively influenced by the contribution of increased water use to capital productivity, leading to an inverted-U relationship between economic growth and the rate of water utilization. Cross-country estimations confirm this relationship and suggest that for most economies current rates of freshwater utilization are not yet constraining growths. However, for a handful of countries, moderate or extreme water scarcity may affect economic growth adversely.© 2011 by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The circular economy (CE) has emerged as a focal point in discussions surrounding sustainable development, industrial production, and resource efficiency. While it has garnered attention as a ground-breaking paradigm with the potential to harmonize economic, societal, and environmental dynamics, divergent perspectives and critical inquiries have surfaced. This paper delves into the interdisciplinary literature on CE, exploring the interpretative flexibility inherent in its conceptualization. Acknowledging the diverse range of strategies associated with the CE, the study contends with the potential risks of its misappropriation, emphasizing the importance of understanding its systemic socio-ecological implications. With an umbrella review approach, rarely applied in social sciences, the study navigates through 167 review articles, unveiling thematic trends and identifying gaps within the existing literature. By scrutinizing the techno-managerial dominance within CE discussions, the paper calls attention to the overshadowing of numerous critical issues. It highlights the importance of systematic attention to CE's social aspects, essential to provide insights into how policies, strategies, and actions affect the society, as well as the emerging discussion on the alternative social transformative paradigm. The paper concludes with a three-stage study design: a meticulous review of 167 articles, a thematic analysis revealing trends, and a reflective exploration of potential research avenues. This review serves as a comprehensive guide for scholars and practitioners for a holistic understanding of CE and encouraging contributions to address identified gaps and fostering the evolution of CE literature. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This study develops novel models of heterogeneous consumer preferences for different dining options and imperfect competition among food suppliers to analyze the market and welfare effects of portion size reduction (PSR) for food away from home. Different scenarios on the nature of differentiation of the dining options, the information available to consumers, and their response to links between portion size and obesity, food waste, and climate change are considered within this framework. The market and welfare effects of the policy are quantified using a simulation analysis. The analysis shows that the market and welfare effects of the policy are case-specific and dependent on the relative magnitude of the cost and utility effects of PSR, the strength of the consumer preference for dining out, and the food suppliers' initial costs and degree of market power in the relevant markets. The policy can create winners and losers among consumers and accounting for consumer heterogeneity, as done in this study, is essential for capturing the asymmetric welfare effects of PSR. Intriguingly, consumers and suppliers can benefit from PSR even without accounting for any health or/and environmental benefits of reduced portion sizes. © 2022 Hosni, Giannakas.

AB  - Negative emissions technologies (NETs), especially bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and direct air capture and storage, have been invoked as necessary to achieve the aspirational 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement. However, currently their costs are estimated to be very high, NETs do not seem to offer co-benefits besides mitigating climate change and there are significant concerns regarding possible negative impacts of their large-scale implementation on sustainable development. Costs can vary significantly due to locational factors such as availability of biomass resources and geological storage capacity. It will be up to progressive industrialized countries to take first steps to mobilize the mitigation potential of NETs. In order to understand whether NETs can provide a significant contribution to mitigation, financial incentives are needed that allow implementing the most attractive NET activities at the global scale. We see the market mechanism under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement–colloquially called ‘Sustainable Development Mechanism’–as a possible cornerstone of such a policy instrument. While initially NETs will not be competitive on the free market, the mechanism can facilitate bilateral financial transfers for NETs, where mitigation units accrue to the financier. We discuss the functions and design elements that an international policy instrument may need to fulfil to successfully mobilize NETs. This includes in particular robust quantification of removed carbon under international oversight and preventing social and environmental conflicts particularly on land and water use by NETs to ensure long-term acceptability. Key policy insights International policy instruments that mobilize negative emissions technologies are inexistent despite most mitigation pathways relying on large-scale NETs implementation later this century. Feasibility of NETs at large-scale is highly uncertain due to high expected costs and political economy challenges. Practical experience is necessary for better understanding feasibility. For cost-effective global deployment of NETs, a policy instrument would need to mobilize international financial flows and implement safeguards concerning sustainable development impacts. The sustainable development mechanism established in Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement could be a good basis for this if it includes a robust approach to evaluating sustainable development impacts building on the sustainable development goals. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The growing geographic disconnect between consumption of goods, the extraction and processing of resources, and the environmental impacts associated with production activities makes it crucial to factor global trade into sustainability assessments. Using an empirically validated environmentally extended global trade model, we examine the relationship between two key resources underpinning economies and human well-being-energy and freshwater. A comparison of three energy sectors (petroleum, gas, and electricity) reveals that freshwater consumption associated with gas and electricity production is largely confined within the territorial boundaries where demand originates. This finding contrasts with petroleum, which exhibits a varying ratio of territorial to international freshwater consumption, depending on the origin of demand. For example, although the United States and China have similar demand associated with the petroleum sector, international freshwater consumption is three times higher for the former than the latter. Based on mapping patterns of freshwater consumption associated with energy sectors at subnational scales, our analysis also reveals concordance between pressure on freshwater resources associated with energy production and freshwater scarcity in a number of river basins globally. These energy-driven pressures on freshwater resources in areas distant from the origin of energy demand complicate the design of policy to ensure security of fresh water and energy supply. Although much of the debate around energy is focused on greenhouse gas emissions, our findings highlight the need to consider the full range of consequences of energy production when designing policy.

AB  - No clear definition of sustainable development exists to guide politicians in solving challenges at the global or regional levels. Rather, the concept's use has increasingly reflected socially desirable attributes of solutions to local- and project-level problems, but these ignore the global challenges that the concept was meant to address. We return to the original definition of sustainable development used in the Brundtland Report and suggest an assessment method to determine whether countries currently meet the threshold values of four equally important primary dimensions: safeguarding long-term ecological sustainability, satisfying basic needs, and promoting intragenerational and intergenerational equity. We also define indicators and threshold values for each of these dimensions; in addition, we show how 167 countries compare in meeting these threshold values. Currently, no country meets all four thresholds. Even so, we propose that, with the use of technology and behavioural changes, it will be possible to reach the threshold values by 2030. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Rice is one of the most important food crops contributing to the diet of large numbers of people especially in Asia. Rice (Oryza sativa) was domesticated in Asia many thousands of years ago and more recently independently in Africa. Wild rice populations are found around the tropical world. The extensive production of rice in many areas has displaced the wild populations that were the basis of the original domestications by humans. Recent research, reviewed here, has identified wild rice species in northern Australia that have been isolated from the impact of domestication in Asia. Wild rice populations contain novel alleles that are a source of desirable traits such as erect habit, disease resistance, large grain size, and unique starch properties. These populations include the most divergent genotypes within the primary gene pool of rice and more distant wild relatives. Genome sequencing also suggests the presence of populations that are close relatives of domesticated rice. Hybrid populations that demonstrate mechanisms of ongoing evolution of wild Oryza have been identified in the wild. These populations provide options for both new domestications and utilization of novel alleles to improve or adapt domesticated rice using conventional or preferably new breeding technologies. Climate change and growing food demands associated with population and economic growth are major challenges for agriculture including rice production. The availability of diverse genetic resources to support crop adaptation and new crop domestication is critical to continued production, and increased efforts to support in situ and ex situ conservation of wild Oryza and related species are warranted. © Copyright © 2019 Henry.

AB  - Both, poverty reduction and preservation of biodiversity are high on the global agenda on sustainable development. The relationships between poverty, biodiversity of agro-ecosystems and agricultural development are complex and poorly understood. In this paper, we present an integrated framework for analysis of agricultural development and natural resource management options at agro-ecosystem level, using Pujiang county, in Zhejiang province, China as a case study area to perform the analysis. A regional linear programming (LP) model is applied, maximizing regional economic surplus, given production and labour market conditions in Pujiang. We use the model to examine the consequences for a set of regional poverty and biodiversity indicators, of four so-called poverty reduction strategies, i.e., (i) intensification of production, (ii) diversification towards livestock production, (iii) land expansion, and (iv) an exit from agriculture. The analysis indicates that diversification is the most promising poverty reduction strategy, but requires efficient use of animal manure in cropping systems to avoid environmental problems. Improved nutrient management in cropping systems is effective in reducing the regional nitrogen surplus, but less effective in increasing per capita income. The exit strategy is effective in reducing poverty and achieving biodiversity goals, but may have important social consequences that are not addressed in this study. Further reduction in rural poverty is hampered by labour constraints during the harvesting period in high value crops such as vegetables and fruits, which calls for research and development in the field of agricultural mechanization. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Within a global society there exist various land use patterns, inequality, and the movement of people and goods. The various practices and behaviours associated with our current society raise questions about the future sustainability of the human population and the natural environment. We derive a simplified model of the global socio-ecological system in an effort to explore the connections between human well-being and land resources, specifically looking at resource accessibility, conservation initiatives and human migration between two economically diverse regions. We find that the spatial aspect of a global system with two distinct regions allows for faster development of technology, higher peaks in population size, greater natural land degradation, and generally speaking lower population well-being in the long-term. The unequal access to resources and differences in technological progress, alter the outcome of land management (i.e., conservation) and social behaviours (i.e., migration). We conclude that any socio-ecological management practices should be conscientious of the diversity in land access, population size, population well-being and development within the global society, as the potential for unintended consequences is high. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The post-Green Revolution period has seen profound changes in the economic situation in South Asia and evolving challenges for the agricultural R&D system. The priorities have changed from a narrow focus on the productivity of food grains to a need for more work on natural resources management and sustainability issues; increasing the productivity and quality of high-value crops, trees, and livestock; agricultural intensification in many less favored areas; more precise targeting of the problems of the poor, including enhancing the micronutrient content of food staples; and analysis of policy and institutional options for achieving more sustainable and pro-poor outcomes in the rural sector. This study draws on the available literature to assess how successful the agricultural R&D system has been in achieving these new goals in South Asia. Overall, it finds that the R&D system has responded well to these changing needs in terms of both budgetary allocations and the kinds of research that has been undertaken. Moreover, market liberalization has enabled a more diverse set of agents to engage in agricultural R&D, and private firms and NGOs have helped ensure that important research and extension needs have not been overlooked. Findings on the impact of this evolving research agenda are mixed. The economic returns to crop improvement research have remained high and well in excess of national discount rates. Public investments in crop improvement research have also given higher returns than most other public investments in rural areas. There is little credible evidence to suggest that these rates of return are declining over time. Agricultural R&D has also made important contributions to reducing poverty in South Asia, but it has done less well in reducing interhousehold and interregional inequities. The greatest impact on poverty has been obtained by lowering food prices, but this pathway might be less important in the future now that food prices are aligned more with border prices and food accounts for a smaller share of consumers' budgets. Also, given that agriculture now plays a relatively small part in the livelihoods of many marginal farmers in South Asia, questions arise about the efficacy of continuing to target agricultural R&D to their problems. Agricultural R&D has also been successful in addressing many of the environmental problems associated with agriculture, with a demonstrated potential for favorable impacts in farmers' fields. Yet the uptake of improved technologies and management practices that reduce environmental damage has been disappointing, particularly in intensively farmed areas. Finally, a large amount of policy research has been undertaken in South Asia since the GR, and case studies show favorable returns to policy research, though the conditions under which it leads to policy change are not well understood.

AB  - Rapid population growth and climate change remain challenges of addressing food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Improving productivity and commercialization of smallholder famers are recognized as effective strategies in addressing food security and sustainable agriculture. Crop choice is a tool for efficient utilization of land, stabilizing food prices and creating a balanced food system. Despite the presence of national agricultural output growth in Ethiopia in recent years, there is widespread concern that the contribution of agricultural output to gross domestic product is below its potential. To find ways to increase smallholders’ crop production and productivity and achieve food security, this study investigated factors determining crop choice in North Shewa Ethiopia. A total of 392 farmers were selected using a Multi-stage random sampling technique. A schedule interview using questionnaire was used to collect cross-sectional data from smallholder farmers, while focus group discussions were organized to supplement the quantitative analysis. Results from descriptive statistics revealed that major sources of income were crop production activities. Findings also revealed that households had acquired land through redistribution and purchasing. The study also revealed that market-associated problems including transportation, weak land contractual enforcements, and inadecquacy of wage laborers during harvesting negatively affect farm income. The study found sorghum, teff, onion and mungbean as dominant crops covering 95 % of the total cultivated land. The finding also indicated that land allocation for each crop is interdependent between crop types and between households through their socio-economic facts. The Fractional multinomial model indicates that market distance and irrigation use were found to influence all four crop shares. The analysis also predicts the association of each variable with each crop share in the form of average marginal effects. The key policy implication is that optimal crop choice and sustainable crop production could easily be achieved through market related mechanisms like insurance and contractual farming. © 2023, African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development.

AB  - An expanding body of literature discusses the importance of sufficiency for sustainable development. However, conceptual vagueness stands in the way of the practical application of sufficiency as a sustainability strategy. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the concept of relations of enoughness, building on the general notion of ‘enough’, which is prevalent in sufficiency literature. Relations of enoughness will be explained based on the widespread use of sufficiency advocating for changes and reductions of individual consumption with the goal to reduce environmental impacts such as carbon dioxide emissions. Diverse uses and understandings of sufficiency can be united in a shared structure of ‘enough/too much/too little of X regarding Y’. Relations of enoughness can be connected to sustainability by expanding them into chains of enoughness, which serve as a conceptual foundation for the sustainable consumption corridor approach. Finally, the premises of sufficiency and potential for further research are discussed. © 2024 The Author(s). Sustainable Development published by ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The rhetoric of the ‘just transition’ lies at the heart of energy and development policies internationally. In this context, it is crucial that communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction and production for employment do not become ‘victims’ of the decarbonisation process. This paper involves a theoretically and conceptually grounded comparative analysis of policy measures that have been introduced in three first world jurisdictions which have been dependent on coal for employment – North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, Alberta in Canada and Victoria in Australia. In so doing, measures which have successfully ameliorated the socio-economic well-being of coal dependent communities are identified and a framework for successful just transition is proposed. Recognising, but notwithstanding, inherent power dynamics, the framework identifies an important role for government in assisting workers and communities in navigating the transition process and in supporting new and emerging low-carbon industries in the context of ‘strong’ sustainable development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to meet future food demand while sustainably managing available land and water resources, irrigated agriculture in semi-arid regions needs to adapt as a response to climate and socio-economic change. In this study, we focus on the Mediterranean region, a dynamic region, which is highly dependent on irrigated agriculture. We provide insight on adaptation strategies implemented on farm level, by doing a systematic review of studies in the region. Our analysis reports 286 implemented adaptations, on 124 different locations throughout the Mediterranean. Additionally, 142 drivers and 324 effects of adaptations were noted. We identified 31 adaptation strategies in 5 main categories: (1) water management, (2) sustainable resource management, (3) technological developments, (4) farm production practices, and (5) farm management. Strategies in the categories water management and farm production practices are most often implemented by farmers in the region. The main driver in the area is water scarcity and adaptations often affected water use and resources in addition to farm practices. Subsequently, we studied the spatial context of adaptations by analyzing the location factors of the five main strategies, using Geographic Information Systems and maximum entropy modeling. Our results show that farmers are more likely to adapt in less rural areas with lower poverty values and better market access, and in areas with higher temperatures and less rainfall. This demonstrates that both biophysical and socio-economic factors determine the context in which adaptations are implemented and that considerable spatial variability in the area exists. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - As the global economy faces the dual challenges of social inequality and environmental degradation, the concepts of inclusive innovation and green growth emerge as critical pathways for sustainable development. Inclusive innovation seeks to democratize access to technology and opportunities, while green growth promotes economic progress with reduced environmental impact. This study explores the relationship between inclusive innovation and green growth by examining how the Global Innovation Index (an indicator for inclusive innovation) affects the carbon intensity of GDP (a measure of green growth). Using an endogenous growth model across 35 Advanced Economies, we employ panel techniques for long-term, quantile, and causality analyses. Our findings reveal that inclusive innovation fosters green growth in the long term, effectively reduces emissions in countries with high innovation adoption, and exhibits robust bidirectional causality between the two. This underscores that inclusive innovation drives not only social equality but also environmental sustainability. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - Natural Resource Accounting (NRA) has become an important environmental/natural resources management tool in recent years. It provides information on stocks of a resource available at a particular point in time and what activities the resource is being used for. The conventional System of National Income Accounts (SNA) normally does not capture the cost of depletion, degradation or pollution of natural resources. This encourages unsustainable use of natural resources since the costs are not reflected when assessing the country's economic performance or development progress. NRA is thus an attempt to integrate environmental issues into the conventional national accounts. The water sector is one sector that could greatly benefit from this natural resource management tool. Botswana has adopted NRA as a natural resource management tool and has so far developed accounts for minerals, livestock and water. The focus of this paper is on Water Accounting (WA) in relation to Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). IWRM is concerned with coordinated development and management of water in order to maximise economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of ecosystems. WA helps fill data gaps since it provides the required information for IWRM to be achieved. The aim of this paper therefore is to evaluate the Water Accounts of Botswana Report of 2006 to determine the extent to which it can contribute to integrated water resources management. The paper is based on literature review and the results show that: the available water stocks vary depending on rainfall patterns, well fields are over utilised, there has been growth in consumption, and more than 80% of the waste water produced is not being put to use. These results calls for changes in policies, role of institutions and practices pertaining to water resources management which is what IWRM is all about hence the paper concludes that indeed WA can contribute to the realisation of IWRM. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article examines two strands of discourse on wild capture fisheries; one that focuses on resource sustainability and environmental impacts, another related to food and nutrition security and human well-being. Available data and research show that, for countries most dependent on fish to meet the nutritional requirements of their population, wild capture fisheries remain the dominant supplier. Although, contrary to popular narratives, the sustainability of these fisheries is not always and everywhere in crisis, securing their sustainability is essential and requires considerable effort across a broad spectrum of fishery systems. An impediment to achieving this is that the current research and policy discourses on environmental sustainability of fisheries and food security remain only loosely and superficially linked. Overcoming this requires adoption of a broader sustainability science paradigm to help harness synergies and negotiate tradeoffs between food security, resource conservation, and macroeconomic development goals. The way society chooses to govern fisheries is, however, an ethical choice, not just a technical one, and we recommend adding an ethical dimension to sustainability science as applied to fisheries.

The chapter intends to focus on such major themes to include: (a) habitat and environmental issues of human concerns, (b) ekistics and ecology of social environment and (c) hazards and environmental management for sustainable development. Management of environment, food security and poverty alleviation are the primary factors contributing to the complexity of natural resource management, which is very important for achieving sustainable development goals. The rural poor depend on agriculture or are otherwise dependent on natural resources for their basic life support systems. The livelihood and well-being of rural and urban people depend fundamentally on the opportunities available to them, and these opportunities are shaped substantially by their access to resources, which in turn depends on numerous underlying political, social and macro-economic factors, those are transforming with the current trends of globalization, migration, market integration, democratization and decentralization. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries provide many benefits to coastal communities in the Indo-Pacific region, including food security, improved nutrition and cash income. However, increasing engagement with the global economy is exerting additional pressure on marine resources and opportunities to engage in alternative livelihoods are often limited by remoteness and a lack of land-based farming opportunities. Bêche-de-mer, the dried body wall of sea cucumber, is a valuable marine export commodity in the region, and an important cash-earning activity in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Sea cucumber mariculture (or holothuriculture), based on the high-value species, sandfish (Holothuria scabra), is also a promising community livelihood. Overfishing of sea cucumber in PNG led the National Fisheries Authority (NFA) to impose a moratorium on the fishery in October 2009. The fishery was reopened in 2017 for less than two months. This article presents socioeconomic data generated before, during and after the 2017 sea cucumber fishing season in three villages in New Ireland Province, PNG, which are also partners in a community-based sandfish mariculture project. The fishery dominated the economies of all three communities while it was open. Increased income was accompanied by high consumption of store-bought foods and purchase of other assets intended to increase living standards. Drawing on current understandings of local culture and political economy, together with the results from the 2017 wild sea cucumber fishery, we discuss how a livelihood based on holothuriculture could coexist with the wild fishery to increase benefits to coastal communities in PNG. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Various approaches have been developed to achieve sustainability in forestry, under changing social needs and, consequently, changing definitions of sustainability. This has led to the confusing situation in which various groups have different understandings of the meaning of 'sustainability'. Likewise, the concepts utilized to achieve sustainability, often with a poorly defined objective, are sometimes not clear and/or inconsistent as a systematic overview regarding definitions and concepts is lacking. Based on a literature review, this paper discusses related terms such as sustainability, sustained yield management, sustainable forestry, sustainable forest management and sustainable development: their history, concepts and relationships, from a European perspective. Finally, flexibility is proposed as a solution to overcome the identified shortcomings at all scales, while focussing on the enterprise level. The origin of the sustainability concept in forestry was first driven by forest experts, while participatory elements have been considered since the more recent idea of sustainable development. Since then, much effort has been made to achieve intragenerational fairness by creating an improved participatory process. Concurrently, the original idea of sustainable forestry as long-term and future-oriented management, considering future generations' needs fell behind. An increasing standing timber volume in Europe and the discussion on climate change brought new interest in how to cope with risks in the context of pervasive future uncertainties within the scope of promoting sustainable development. Although the consideration of risk has been concentrated on as a topic in forest science in recent years, studies have mainly focused on the enhancement of forest resistance against disturbances. However, precaution and risk avoidance alone are probably insufficient to achieve an improved sustainable development that focuses on intergenerational fairness, as these more defensive approaches may disregard important management opportunities involved with an uncertain future. A perhaps more promising approach, the idea of future options and the ability to respond to changing social and biophysical circumstances (i.e. flexibility) as criteria for sustainable development have only shown a shadowy existence up to now. To further develop the consistency of sustainability concepts, a shift of sustainability approaches from continuity towards flexibility options is proposed. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - A triple bottom line (TBL) approach was used to examine the trade-offs between potential reclaimed water management strategies in a closed basin. The goals of the water management strategy included minimizing water source shortages, ensuring safe and resilient future water supplies, and protecting inland ecosystems through adequate surface flows. The TBL approach consisted of quantitative and qualitative impact assessments of social, environmental, and economic criteria. This research examined how potable reuse of reclaimed water addresses water needs in a closed basin such as maintaining water quality, managing reclaimed water disposal, meeting growing water demand, balancing groundwater extraction rates with inflows, preserving inland ecosystems, and ensuring a locally controlled safe drinking water source. The TBL assessment first evaluated water stress based on water demand and supply under status quo conditions. The results were compared with the potable reuse scenario, which provides more environmental and social benefits than the status quo scenario. Water Environ.

AB  - The rapid expansion of human activities, particularly after industrialization, created significant environmental and social challenges. Depletion of natural resource, climate change, population growth, and unsustainable consumption practices have all resulted in significant environmental damage around the world. The rising environmental impacts are due to excessive water usage in textile manufacturing, contamination from processing chemicals, and the amount of waste generated during disposal. In a world where social and environmental issues are becoming increasingly important, the fashion industry is in dire need to lessen and monitor its environmental and social impact. Amidst several innovative approaches to contribute to sustainable growth, many apparel manufacturers and designers are now providing clothing options labelled green textiles to consumers. Green clothing is also being produced to reduce the waste of natural resources like water, plants, energy, and land. Furthermore, Indians are becoming more interested in green or organic clothing brands which will most likely contribute to the apparel sector’s revenues. The current study reviews the concept of green apparel, consumers’ awareness of green fashion, the drivers that impact their purchase decision and choices, and the common dilemma of consumers’ preferences for green products. It will emphasize the importance of understanding barriers to more sustainable production and consumption systems. Consumers can be educated about environmentally friendly attributes and benefits, resulting in a favorable understanding of green apparel benefits and value. Thus, the proposed work would lead to policy making as retailers and manufacturers can benefit through more focused strategies for environmental safety to reduce non-green branded products while educating their consumers about green apparel. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - The United States plays a key role in global food security by producing and exporting agricultural products. Groundwater irrigation is increasingly important in agricultural production, nearly tripling since records began in 1950. Increased reliance on groundwater and prolonged unsustainable pumping of aquifers has led to groundwater depletion in many areas. In this study, we ask: How much groundwater depletion is embedded in the domestic transfers and international agricultural exports of the United States? How much do domestic and international agricultural commodity fluxes rely on unsustainable groundwater use? To address these questions, we quantify the amount of nonrenewable groundwater that is incorporated into agricultural commodities produced in the United States and transferred both within the country and exported internationally. We find that 26.3 km (Formula presented.) of nonrenewable groundwater was transferred domestically in 2002 and 2.7 km (Formula presented.) was sent abroad. In 2012, 34.8 km (Formula presented.) was transferred domestically and 3.7 km (Formula presented.) was exported. This indicates an increase of 32% in domestic transfers and 38% in international exports. In 2002, we find that 1,491,126 kt (340 billion USD) of agricultural products reliant on nonrenewable groundwater were domestically transferred, while 119,048 kt (47 billion USD) were exported. In 2012, the mass transfer of agricultural goods reliant on unsustainable groundwater decreased, but their value in national and international supply chains increased by 54% and 31%, respectively. Our results underscore the importance of the long-term risks posed to global agricultural supply chains from reliance on unsustainable groundwater use. © 2020. American Geophysical Union.

AB  - After a short introduction on the importance of the agro-food sector in the economies of most of present-day societies, the article focuses on the role of agriculture in protecting the environment and enhancing biodiversity. The importance of a shift toward agricultural systems, which are more complex in terms of biodiversity in emerging countries such as China, where most of the population (about 70%) lives in rural areas, in poor conditions and still relies on agriculture as the main source of income is discussed. In China the risk of shifting to more intensive and polluting agricultural production patterns to address the demand for food of the growing population and the need of higher incomes of rural communities is relatively high. With the present Chinese economic growth, urbanization and increased leisure time, tourism and recreation activities in rural areas are also increasing. Additionally, in the restructuring process of economy in rural areas, one of the most obvious effects is the necessity to create job opportunities alternative to agricultural sector. The role of sustainable agriculture for environment protection in a country such as China is highlighted. The attention paid to activities in the agro-environmental sector has been increasing over the years in this country due to the high social and economic priority attached by the Chinese authorities to the modernization of agriculture that must be pursued in a sustainable manner, addressing at once food security, environment protection, economic development and good management of natural resources. The experience gained in the framework of the Sino-Italian Cooperation Programme for Environment Protection jointly launched by the Italian Ministry for the Environment and Territory (IMET) and the State Environment Protection Administration of China (SEPA) in the year 2000, through the implementation of several cooperation projects in different rural areas of China is critically discussed. The approached adopted, avoiding pursuing short-term objectives, due to the pressure for profit, to ensure the replicability and long-term sustainability of transferred technologies are described. Important in all cooperation projects carried out have been training and information activities to enable the actual transfer into practice of target sustainable agricultural technologies and practices. All stakeholders have been involved in project preparation and implementation. Particularly, academic institutions, public research centers and private companies have been partnered with the aim of creating long lasting network of local and international researchers and experts supporting the development and the adaptation of sustainable farming systems as well as the design of new regulatory framework supporting the adoption of innovative technologies. District workshop and seminar have been organized in order to keep people involved in project activities continuously aware of all progress as well as to inform stakeholders on scientific, technical and economic feasibility of upcoming new techniques and systems. The synergic role provided by the different projects in promoting environment protection and sustainable agriculture at once, represents a strong effective effort toward the rural development of different regions.

AB  - This paper argues that the development of energy systems rests on a combination of three different domains of socio-economic processes and associated modes of decision-making. For shorthand these are termed 'satisficing', 'optimising', and 'transforming' domains, with corresponding underpinnings found in behavioural, neoclassical, and evolutionary economics respectively. Each domain operates at different scales of time and personal/organisational/societal decision-making, and explains different characteristics of how energy systems develop. At least since the industrial revolution, the nature of energy systems has depended on government policy, and each domain implies a need for different policy instruments; the combination of all three lays the foundations for far more coherent, effective, and mutually reinforcing policies, including those required to transform energy systems in the light of environmental constraints. The approach also provides a coherent theoretical framework for understanding the conditions under which co-benefits and 'green growth' may emerge from environmental policy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Durum wheat is a crucial staple crop in many arid and semi-arid regions around the world, significantly contributing to local food security. This review paper aims to explore the current status of durum wheat productivity and the potential impacts of future climatic conditions on its cultivation. Various drivers and constraints affecting durum wheat yield are examined, including biotic and abiotic stressors, CO2 concentrations and agronomic practices. Drought and heat stress were identified as the primary yield limiting factors. Furthermore, the influence of climate change on durum wheat is evaluated, focusing on altered precipitation patterns, temperature extremes, and increased atmospheric CO2 levels. Most prominent quantification methods for climate change impact on yields are explored. The paper provides a summary of the current state of research, which reveals some contradictory results for future durum wheat yields. On the one hand, significant increases in productivity due to the fertilization effect of higher CO2 levels are predicted. On the other hand, the crop failures are foreseen as consequence of elevated heat and drought stress as part of climate change. Overall, this paper underlines the importance of understanding the complex interactions between climate change and durum wheat productivity and highlights the urgency to explore sustainable adaptation strategies to ensure future food security. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The just transition (JT) perspective has gained a generalized attention in recent years in conjunction with the increasing pressures that Western societies are under to green their economies as a way to address climate change. In this perspective the role of trade unions (TUs) is central as they are encouraged to drive the socio-technical transformation to avoid the intensification of the dilemma between the protection of jobs and the protection of the environment. The article explores the way in which TUs thematize the challenge of the JT in a specific locality – Taranto, Southern Italy – and in one of the most carbon-intensive sectors – the steel industry. Although they share common concerns, different positions emerge in relation to the nature of the challenge and the possible pathways to greening steel production in the area. Yet, trade unions are still elaborating the question of the role that they are called to play in it. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Sustainable Agriculture is a term that has grown out of global call for sustainable development. Unfortunately, the term has been very widely adopted to represent a variety of initiatives. If the term is to retain any meaning it must be refined and defined. In this paper sustainability was defined as: The maintenance of the net benefits agriculture provides to society for present and future generations. This definition is very much a humanist approach, which includes both consumer and producer surplus. The paper identifies the conflict that may occur between consumer surplus, producer surplus and total economic surplus. From a consumer surplus point of view food security, and discounting are major issues. The compensating variation of a famine may be infinite making food security a primary goal of many nations. The maximization of the net returns from agricultural production represents me producer surplus point view. A second, somewhat related concern is the maintenance of minimum level of income in the agricultural sector. Consumer surplus is threatened by food scarcity, and agricultural income is threatened by surpluses. Price is the best measure we have of scarcity. To discuss sufficiency in the absence of price is very misleading. Similarly, describing sustainability in terms of expected output and prices is also misleading. It is unplanned scarcity and abundance that threatens food security and economic viability respectively. It is therefore, the ability of the agricultural system to respond and rule out extreme price that is central to the issue of sustainability. Given the inelastic nature of the demand the ability for sustainable agriculture may largely be a function of the elasticity of supply. The ability of fixed factors such as land to enter and exit a sector may also augment sustainability. A thirdsource, of economic flexibility is alternative technologies that can be applied at very low or high prices. This flexibility has to be valued not at expected prices but rather for the option values at extreme prices. Government has a role in sustainability. Governments should pursue policies which enhance the elasticity of supply. Policies that stabilize income through prices have the opposite effect. These programs should at a minimum be decoupled. Secondly, governments should spend research dollars on technologies that enhance the elasticity of supply. Finally, land set aside programs, add great deal to the elasticity of supply. © 1991 by the Canadian Agricultural Economics Society

AB  - The transition from a carbon-driven economy to a green-driven economy demands a paradigm shift in institutions and change in infrastructure. This paper examines the Brazilian quest for a green and equitable economy. Brazil's green liabilities range from a carbon-intensive transportation matrix to a poorly developed social infrastructure. Yet, Brazil offers one of the world's most biodiverse landscapes, a large reservoir of fresh water and the world's largest tropical forest. Using a 'politics of attention' perspective, we propose that it is precisely the mobility of the Brazilian economy that precludes its evolution as a vanguard of change. Its rising status as a part of the global economic agenda makes it accept globalization without making an effective paradigm shift toward the environment and social justice. A transition to a green economy cannot be achieved using management practices that drive a carbon-intensive economy. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

Design/methodology/approach: This study conceptually discusses the effects of COVID-19 on the LAC region and highlights potential areas for recovery. Findings: The LAC region have a history of facing structural development challenges – due to digital inequality, environmental degradation, erosion of democracy and financial debt – which have led to a profound discontent among people in the LAC region and this dissatisfaction has been intensified by the crises stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. LAC region can increase its resilience and recover its path to sustainable development by consolidating impact-based regional value chains, attracting sustainability-themed foreign direct investment and nurturing structural development to facilitate LAC companies to expand into international markets (“multilatinas”). Research limitations/implications: There are some preliminary studies on the economic and social impact of COVID-19 on the LAC region, however, the strategies that emerging and developing economies might pursue to promptly recover are still a matter of discussion. The uncertainty and heterogeneity of the developing and emerging economies and the multidimensional needed actions require local adaptations and adjustments. Originality/value: The LAC COVID-19 crisis recovery requires shared responsibility, global solidarity, urgent and immediate cooperation and structural transformations to enable deeper regional integration. This integration should focus on impact-based value chains to be resiliently adaptable to changing global realities and arduous local contexts. This paper provides integrative avenues for potential regional recovery within the region. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Inland small-scale fisheries provide important ecosystem services in sub-Saharan Africa as a source of nutritious food to over 200 million people and offer avenues for countries to attain Sustainable Development Goal 2. However, there is a dearth of knowledge on the pathways of fish to food security, especially in the case of inland small-scale fisheries, which are often underrepresented in research and policy discussions. We review the literature from 2010 to the present to assess how fish food systems, specifically those associated with inland small-scale fisheries in sub-Saharan Africa, relate to the four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability, as well as women's empowerment. We offer an assessment of the extent to which each of these pillars of food security has been thoroughly conceptualized and investigated in the literature, identifying important avenues for future research. Overfishing, post-harvest losses, and trade influences drive fish availability in many contexts. Income benefits from participating in small-scale fisheries were important for attaining access to fish for food security and other important livelihood outcomes. Few studies addressed utilization and stability compared to availability and access pillars. Further, few studies examined how gender shapes outcomes of women's empowerment. The results lead to the proposed research agenda of focusing on all pillars of food security that can enhance the sustainable contribution of inland small-scale fisheries to food security.

AB  - In this paper, I analyze the constraints that limit biomass from becoming an alternative, sustainable and efficient energy source, at least in relation to the current metabolism of developed countries. In order to be termed sustainable, the use of an energy source should be technically feasible, economically affordable and environmentally and socially viable, considering society as a whole. Above all, it should meet society's "metabolic needs," a fundamental issue that is overlooked in the mainstream biofuels narrative. The EROI (Energy Return on Investment) of biofuels reaches a few units, while the EROI of fossil fuels is 20-30 or higher and has a power density (W/m2) thousands of times higher than the best biofuels, such as sugarcane in Brazil. When metabolic approaches are used it becomes clear that biomass cannot represent an energy carrier able to meet the metabolism of industrialized societies. For our industrial society to rely on "sustainable biofuels" for an important fraction of its energy, most of the agricultural and non-agricultural land would need to be used for crops, and at the same time a radical cut to our pattern of energy consumption would need to be implemented, whilst also achieving a significant population reduction. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Greater economic growth could lead to greater greenhouse gas emissions, while simultaneously enhancing various aspects of human well-being and the capacity to adapt to climate change. This begs the question as to whether and, if so, for how long would a richer-but-warmer world be better for well-being than poorer-but-cooler worlds. To shed light on this issue, this paper draws upon results of the "Fast Track" assessment (FTA) reported in a special issue of Global Environmental Change: Part A 14 (1): 1-99 (2004), which employed the IPCC's emissions scenarios to project future climate change and its global impacts on various determinbts of human and environmental well-being. Results suggest that notwithstanding climate change, through much of this century, human well-being is likely to be highest in the richest-but-warmest (A1FI) world and lower in poorer-but-cooler worlds. With respect to environmental well-being, matters may be best under the A1FI world for some critical environmental indicators through 2085-2100, but not necessarily for others. An alternative analysis using the Stem Review's worst-case results for potential welfare losses due to climate change indicates that welfare, adjusted for market and non-market impacts of climate change and the risk of catastrophe, should be highest under the A1FI scenario, at least through 2100.

AB  - Continuing population and consumption growth will mean that the global demand for food will increase for at least another 40 years. Growing competition for land, water, and energy, in addition to the overexploitation of fisheries, will affect our ability to produce food, as will the urgent requirement to reduce the impact of the food system on the environment. The effects of climate change are a further threat. But the world can produce more food and can ensure that it is used more efficiently and equitably. A multifaceted and linked global strategy is needed to ensure sustainable and equitable food security, different components of which are explored here. © 2010 American Association for the Advancement for Science.

AB  - Energy and food security is alarmed by the influences of climate change, population, and world economic growth. In this perspective, the co-located agrivoltaic system, a nexus of photovoltaic and agriculture production, is more suitable to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of a country like India. An experimental investigation has been conducted at CUTM, Odisha through a portable and adjustable agrivoltaic system of 0.675 kWp capacity in 11 m2 of land area to study the enhancement of land productivity and revenue of farmers or/and investors. This system provides an underneath farming of 1.5 kg turmeric as a shadow tolerant medicinal crop. Major performance indicators of the project such as land equivalent ratio, benefit-cost ratio, price-performance ratio, and payback period have been found as 1.73, 1.71, 0.79, and 9.49 years respectively. Further, the temperature level is decreased by 1–1.5 °C resulting in the improvement of the energy generation in the system and successfully tested in dual DC micro-grid solutions having two 12 V 75 Ah solar tubular batteries. This work can be extended to different scales of agrivoltaic systems with suitable crops in th farmers' land, as they are the end-users of this co-located system. © 2022 International Energy Initiative

AB  - Recent major investments in infrastructure in the United States and globally present a crucial opportunity to embed equity within the heart of resilient infrastructure decision-making. Yet there is a notable absence of frameworks within the engineering and scientific fields for integrating equity into planning, design, and maintenance of infrastructure. Additionally, whole-of-government approaches to infrastructure, including the Justice40 Initiative, mimic elements of process management that support exploitative rather than exploratory innovation. These and other policies risk creating innovation traps that limit analytical and engineering advances necessary to prioritize equity in decision-making, identification and disruption of mechanisms that cause or contribute to inequities, and remediation of historic harms. Here, we propose a three-tiered framework toward equitable and resilient infrastructure through restorative justice, incremental policy innovation, and exploratory research innovation. This framework aims to ensure equitable access and benefits of infrastructure, minimize risk disparities, and embrace restorative justice to repair historical and systemic inequities. We outline incremental policy innovation and exploratory research action items to address and mitigate risk disparities, emphasizing the need for community-engaged research and the development of equity metrics. Among other action items, we recommend a certification system—referred to as Social, Environmental, and Economic Development (SEED)—to train infrastructure engineers and planners and ensure attentiveness to gaps that exist within and dynamically interact across each tier of the proposed framework. Through the framework and proposed actions, we advocate for a transformative vision for equitable infrastructure that emphasizes the interconnectedness of social, environmental, and technical dimensions in infrastructure planning, design, and maintenance. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Although commercial entities can contribute positively to health and society there is growing evidence that the products and practices of some commercial actors—notably the largest transnational corporations—are responsible for escalating rates of avoidable ill health, planetary damage, and social and health inequity; these problems are increasingly referred to as the commercial determinants of health. The climate emergency, the non-communicable disease epidemic, and that just four industry sectors (ie, tobacco, ultra-processed food, fossil fuel, and alcohol) already account for at least a third of global deaths illustrate the scale and huge economic cost of the problem. This paper, the first in a Series on the commercial determinants of health, explains how the shift towards market fundamentalism and increasingly powerful transnational corporations has created a pathological system in which commercial actors are increasingly enabled to cause harm and externalise the costs of doing so. Consequently, as harms to human and planetary health increase, commercial sector wealth and power increase, whereas the countervailing forces having to meet these costs (notably individuals, governments, and civil society organisations) become correspondingly impoverished and disempowered or captured by commercial interests. This power imbalance leads to policy inertia; although many policy solutions are available, they are not being implemented. Health harms are escalating, leaving health-care systems increasingly unable to cope. Governments can and must act to improve, rather than continue to threaten, the wellbeing of future generations, development, and economic growth. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper explores the trends driving the growing demand for food imports to the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region through the lens of ‘decoupling’. The analysis deploys a water-specific model of the general idea of resource decoupling to analyse the role and potential of food and virtual water trade in alleviating national and regional water limits. Decoupling theorises the breaking of the link between economic and population growth and need for water demand for domestic food production. A key means of reducing pressure on scarce water resources of a growing population is to increase the proportion of food sourced from abroad. This strategy has been strongly embraced politically in a number of MENA economies facing a combination of water and labour shortage. Food imports provide a politically silent mechanism to achieve national food security, and generate significant markets for food-exporting, water abundant, economies including those in the tropics. This paper combines FAO Food Balance data with Water Footprint data to reveal how virtual water flows interact with food import tonnages to enhance or retard national decoupling based on food trade. The analysis reveals that much MENA water is directed at crops adapted to the MENA climate. However, the analysis reveals significant potential for the import of large quantities of MENA water needs from more water abundant countries through supply of staple crops. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and International Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - Based on the panel data of 281 city level in China for the period of 2004–2016, this study uses the Cobb–Douglas production function to investigate the distribution of environmental regulation dividends and further adopts the threshold model to explore the impact of environmental regulation dividends inequality (ERDI) on inclusive growth (IG). Results indicate that the distribution structure of the environmental regulation dividends has improved, but the inequality between urban–rural residents is still apparent. Environmental regulation dividends inequality has a non-linear threshold effect on inclusive growth, which turns from a significant inhibition to a slight promotion after exceeding the threshold value. Grouping tests show that environmental regulation dividends inequality has a heterogeneous effect on cities with different resource endowments and leading industries and still inhibits inclusive growth of non-resource-based cities even if the inequality is higher than the threshold value. Mechanism analysis reveals that primary distribution and redistribution are the main channels through which environmental regulation dividends inequality inhibits and promotes inclusive growth when the inequality is below and above the threshold value, respectively. These conclusions have important implications for enhancing and distributing environmental regulation dividends to promote inclusive growth. Copyright © 2022 Ge, Ding, Lin, Yang and Ji.

More concretely, it analyses the interconnectedness of these challenges and their impact on the sustainability of food production, distribution, and access. By raising awareness of these vulnerabilities, this research seeks to reflect upon the multifaceted obstacles that must be addressed to realise the vision of a world without hunger, such as the dominant productivist narrative. In this sense, it advocates for a comprehensive approach to tackle the root causes of food insecurity and emphasises the need for transformative policies that foster resilience and inclusivity in global food systems. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Lucía Morales, Bernadette Andreosso-O’Callaghan and Daniel Rajmil; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology to assess the sustainable indicators for a socially responsible company operating in the chemical industry sector and to evaluate those indicators within a specific chemical industry facility that manufactures polymers. When drafting this document the challenge to face was how Mexican companies labeled as Socially Responsible Companies, could be sustainable, considering the Triple Bottom Line of sustainability: social, environmental and economic as well as achieving the Principle of Sustainable Development: to meet actual needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own. The guiding method of this research was a qualitative analysis of different tools, with a pragmatic approach gained due to professional experience in the chemical industry sector. In general, conditions in the Mexican manufacturing sector are not optimal considering that most petrochemical products, including fuels, are imported; being this energy supply key to keep manufacturing facilities operational. A review of the economic theory that underlies social management and sustainable development was included. The financial results of the private companies as their most important objective, as well as the environmental care and community welfare are government accountability; both are supported in the neoclassical economic theory, though this is not justified from an economics of natural resources point of view. Modern economy encompasses several theories regarding the environment: circular economy, economy, economy of natural resources and environmental taxes were very useful as a framework of public policies implemented in Mexico. One of our major concerns relates to green taxes. Due to our eroded economic conditions any type of tax, including environmental taxes, is carefully considered by the Government in order not to affect competitiveness with Mexican companies. As soon as the Climate Change Bill was enacted in 2012, green taxes were levied on carbon and fossil fuels in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions; unfortunately, it is expected to get significant results in a longer time. Even the Energy Transition Law enacted in 2015 offered the opportunity to create new sources of renewable energy, but it is evident that the petrochemical industry holds a significant role in the Mexican energy market. The persistence of intergovernmental conflicts such as the rivalries between federal and provincial environmental governments, as well as costly bureaucratic structures, resulted in a poor performance in the environmental regulation. Under these circumstances, the private industry, specifically the chemical industry, must strive to work efficiently to avoid any environmental impact, even regulation does not include any specific action. The chemical sector represents industries where preventive pollution practices are well recognized, although they are not a priority. Indicators are the only way to monitor environmental performance. The methodology designed considered the identification of indicators in each and every one of the stages, according to the Intersection Circles Model. Due the broad scope of the themes, this work deepens the search for economic-environmental indicators; and under a shorter scope, the environmental-social indicators. The methodology describes the way to find indicators in each one of the three stages: (a) individual: those aligned to the legal compliment; (b) sustainable development indicators: interrelated indicators, those addressed in the intersection of two circles. These indicators are: social-economic, environmental-economic and socialenvironmental; (c) the last stage referred to are the sustainable indicators (those aligned to the sustainable development principle) and addressed in the intersection of three circles. Sustainable indicators were defined with the contribution of a specialized resins chemical company (polymers manufacturer). The results obtained in the first stage made clear that the indicators documented by companies are based solely on legal requirements, and are in no way related to social or environmental impacts. Conclusions included further lines of investigation. In regards to the government, to monitor sustainable indicators that should be reported from the industry; this information could be an input to design public environmental policies in order to contribute to the growth of Mexican economy. In regards to the academy, to work closely with government and private sectors in order to make applied investigations. Finally, in regards to the industry, to implement a Socially Responsible Model within their strategies and pursue the objectives proposed. An interrelation among these three groups to participate as a team was a reiterated recommendation. Lastly, we consider that this research will offer important contributions to companies that have a social responsibility, by supplying a methodology, which will enable them: (a) to identify stakeholders with whom the company has social responsibilities; (b) to identify the potential social, environmental and economic impacts to the stakeholders and prevent them; and (c) to include the Socially Responsible Model proposed, in order to render economic benefits by means of socially responsible practices. © Serials Publications Pvt.

AB  - China is facing the challenge of climate change and environmental protection in line with the promotion of sustainable development goals. Climate, environmental, and economic policy can each individually impact the effectiveness of other policies in the process of implementation. Understanding synergies among policy measures and identifying the co-benefits of environmental sustainable development generated by them is the focus of the paper. Because of existing restrictions in current research methods, the research community lacks the capacity to detect the interrelation among environmental, economic, and social development. Co-benefit research has gradually become an important area on sustainable development. Based on endogenous economic growth theory, we build a modified endogenous growth model to determine the optimal rates of economic growth, environmental pollution, energy input, and other factors in the context of co-benefits. Further empirical analysis is given which is missing in previous studies in this field. The empirical analysis reveals that China’s actual GDP, consumption, energy input, and physical capital growth rates are much higher than the optimal growth rate. However, the human capital and environmental pollution control growth rates are slower than the optimal values. Although China has a rapid growth in economy, the optimal level of comprehensive co-benefits has not been reached yet. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This paper ranks two widely used command-and-control environmental instruments, in terms of relevant equilibrium variables such as output, profits, consumer surplus and social welfare. Specifically, we consider n symmetric and polluting firms that compete in quantity, have access to an exogenous cleaning technology (that cannot be modified by the firms) and are subject to environmental regulation by means of either emission or performance standards. We consider a one-stage game, where the instruments are exogenously fixed in such a way that pollution coincides for both regimes. In this game, the performance standard dominates in terms of output and consumer surplus, but the firms prefer the emission standard. In terms of social welfare, the performance standard may dominate the emission standard when the number of firms is limited, which contrasts with the case of perfect competition, where the emission standard is welfare-superior. These results on social welfare prevail when we introduce a previous stage where the environmental authority optimally chooses the instrument by maximizing social welfare, that is, when we endogenize the policies. © 2020, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Globally, demand for food animal products is rising. At the same time, we face mounting, related pressures including limited natural resources, negative environmental externalities, climate disruption, and population growth. Governments and other stakeholders are seeking strategies to boost food production efficiency and food system resiliency, and aquaculture (farmed seafood) is commonly viewed as having a major role in improving global food security based on longstanding measures of animal production efficiency. The most widely used measurement is called the 'feed conversion ratio' (FCR), which is the weight of feed administered over the lifetime of an animal divided by weight gained. By this measure, fed aquaculture and chickens are similarly efficient at converting feed into animal biomass, and both are more efficient compared to pigs and cattle. FCR does not account for differences in feed content, edible portion of an animal, or nutritional quality of the final product. Given these limitations, we searched the literature for alternative efficiency measures and identified 'nutrient retention', which can be used to compare protein and calories in feed (inputs) and edible portions of animals (outputs). Protein and calorie retention have not been calculated for most aquaculture species. Focusing on commercial production, we collected data on feed composition, feed conversion ratios, edible portions (i.e. yield), and nutritional content of edible flesh for nine aquatic and three terrestrial farmed animal species. We estimate that 19% of protein and 10% of calories in feed for aquatic species are ultimately made available in the human food supply, with significant variation between species. Comparing all terrestrial and aquatic animals in the study, chickens are most efficient using these measures, followed by Atlantic salmon. Despite lower FCRs in aquaculture, protein and calorie retention for aquaculture production is comparable to livestock production. This is, in part, due to farmed fish and shrimp requiring higher levels of protein and calories in feed compared to chickens, pigs, and cattle. Strategies to address global food security should consider these alternative efficiency measures. © 2018 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Food waste is economically and ecologically unsustainable; the benefits of food waste reduction are indisputable. Yet knowledge of the economic trade-offs and knock-on effects of such reduction is deficient. This study examines the economic effects of food waste reduction in a rural region that is a nationally important producer of agricultural and food products in Finland. We built a detailed social accounting matrix to trace the transactions among the economic agents. Five different simulations of food waste reduction were run by applying a computable general equilibrium model. In the simulations, households and food services halved their food waste. The results indicated that food waste reduction is economically worthwhile in terms of regional investments and gross domestic product at market prices. However, the reduction induced economic trade-offs and welfare redistribution. The value added to the agriculture and food industries and the welfare of agricultural households decreased, albeit that the simulated compensations alleviated the effects. In the long run, falling agricultural wages and factor incomes entail closedowns and, finally, decrease local food production. This aspect is worth considering in terms of policy planning under the principle of just transition of the European Green Deal. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Many are worried that the global food system is entering a period of intense volatility driven by a combination of climate change and population growth. One way to address this problem is for governments and the international community to store more food as a buffer against crisis. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of food storage as a component of a robust food security strategy in the twenty-first century. We do this by first drawing on historical examples from ancient Rome and China, where preindustrial government designed extensive systems that ensured adequate food storage to keep food systems stable. Next, we review the links between food storage and price volatility in the last 20 years and demonstrate that the size of food stores (and in particular grain reserves) directly relates to price volatility. Third, we explore three different types of policies designed to promote grain reserves, the US’s “ever-normal granary” policy, the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, and the Strategic Grain Reserve in Africa. In this third section, we show how there has been a decline from state-owned strategic grain reserves in favor of a more market-oriented approach that is dominated by a handful of powerful corporations who maintain sophisticated supply chains. Because data on the amount of food supply these corporations hold in storage are proprietary secrets, it is impossible to assess how resilient or vulnerable this makes our food system. Finally, we conclude that over time, food storage has fallen in and out of favor, criticized for being expensive yet often shown to play an important role in protecting poor consumers in times of food crisis. Given the lack of data on current levels of supply chain and household storage, more research is needed to evaluate the scale at which food storage systems should be implemented to ensure food system resilience as well as the most effective mechanisms to govern and manage them. © 2015, AESS.

AB  - Rural areas in the United States are losing people, communities and ecosystem services due to outmigration of population, and loss of small, biodiverse farms. One large driving force is consolidation of farmlands into larger production units and consequent loss of biodiversity in areas within and adjacent to production fields. This century-long trend has accelerated in the past decade due to high commodity prices and introduction of labor-saving technologies such as transgenic crops and larger machinery. Federal farm support programs and favorable economic conditions for farm expansion have also contributed to the trend. Research on technologies that are more accessible to large operations and aggressive input marketing practices further stimulate consolidation. In spite of apparent efficiencies and economic power of an industrial agricultural system, all is not positive. There is growing societal concern that current trends are leading to a tragedy of the commons. Issues relating to where and how food is grown, trade-offs between production of food vs. fuel, and distribution of benefits from agriculture when economic and political power are concentrated are being debated. Growing public interest in food safety, nutrition, food security, and healthy environments adds to discourse about the present structure of agriculture. A growing segment of society envisions national food and farming policies that would help restore small and medium-sized family farms and rural communities, and to enhance ecosystem services provided by bio-diverse rural landscapes-in essence, reversing the current tragedy of the commons by pursuing a more equitable and sustainable farming and food system. © 2014 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - As agriculture appears to be globally the greatest water user and water scarcity, due to fresh water shortages or deterioration of fresh water quality, is listed among the major global risks, efficient use of water resources is closely linked to sustainable agricultural practices. Water footprint (WF) has been largely employed during the last decade as a useful tool for planning efficient water management strategies at global, national, regional or even water basin level. WF is an indicator that is based on methods and tools that calculate the amount of water used along the full supply chain of a product. 'Konservolea' is a local table olive cultivar assigned as a protected geographical indication (PGI) product of Arta, Greece. It is the main table olive cultivar in the area, it has a significant impact on local economy and it exhibits favorable economic and market prospects. In this study the WF of 'Konservolea' was calculated based on actual data from four olive groves and the results are presented and discussed. All four groves were conventionally treated according to the local practices regarding pruning, fertilisation, plant protection, etc. Three of the olive groves were irrigated, while the fourth was rainfed. The WF of the four olive groves ranged from 354 to 961 m3 t-1 of olive fruit. The results provide a first yet solid assessment of the WF of table olive crop in the area and underline the effect of different agronomic practices on WF. Practical difficulties regarding the calculation of WF that need to be further investigated and resolved are pointed out. © 2022 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Governments and international organizations are increasingly determined to create more sustainable food value chains (SFVCs). However, only little empirical evidence is available on how SFVCs are understood. Enquiring African food value chain actors allows gathering valuable insights into their perception of sustainability, which characteristics of sustainable food value chains they prioritize, and which obstacles to a sustainable transformation they identify. By means of a Q-methodology involving interviews with 33 Kenyan respondents, four perspectives were distinguished. The first perspective, “economic productivity and growth,” prioritizes economic growth and has only limited attention to the social dimension of sustainability. The second perspective, “food security and food availability,” believes that ensuring food security should be the key goal of SFVCs. The third perspective, “environment first,” is dedicated to the environmental dimension of sustainability; the perspective implies that protecting natural resources is the primary way to sustain this level of production. The fourth perspective, “transformative knowledge,” entails that by innovating and sharing knowledge, food value chains can become more sustainable in different areas. Overall, this study provides reliable insights into how Kenyan food value chain actors perceive sustainability in their sector and which elements they believe should be prioritized when rethinking food systems. The study results are valuable for policy-making to further define an SFVC in Kenya and to pave the way for a sustainable transformation of the food sector in developing countries. © 2023, AESS.

AB  - Abstract: Developing nations, including India, face a number of daunting challenges in the twenty-first century, including population growth, political strife, rapid urbanization, food and water scarcity, environmental pollution, infectious diseases, and climate change. In this turbulent era, there is a need for resilience at every level—from the village family to the corporate boardroom to the halls of government. We argue that achieving resilience will require both enlightened government policies and successful initiatives by social and environmental innovators that demonstrate the capacity for adapting to these challenges. Such practical first steps can serve as models for creating a more resilient and sustainable economy in India. One way to stimulate rapid progress is development of circular economy solutions that create innovative pathways for utilization of discarded materials, thus seeking to eliminate waste. Previous research has shown that such initiatives reduce environmental pressures and improve community resilience, while stimulating the regional economy. An international conference on Waste Management Innovation, held in 2017 in Mumbai with funding from the US Consulate General, resulted in the award of seed grants to two Indian non-profits that sought to apply circular economy principles to regional communities—one urban and one rural. These initiatives provide case studies of circular economy implementation. The World Institute of Sustainable Energy has developed an action plan to capture at least 60 percent of the electronic waste generated in the city of Pune, one of the largest metropolitan areas in India. Their approach is based on circular economy principles, and has been embraced in stakeholder meetings with city officials as well as local residents and non-governmental organizations. Barefoot College has established and demonstrated a low-cost, end-to-end solid waste management model for rural villages that is designed by the local community. Their unique approach ensures sanitation, environmental protection, income and livelihood generation, and drives behavioral change in village residents by motivating them to maintain community hygiene. This paper presents the results of these two efforts, and suggests what lessons were learned. One overarching insight is that an integrated systems view is necessary to understand the interplay of economic, environmental, and social forces.

AB  - "How did I get here?" (Byrne and Eno. Once in a lifetime-Talking Heads song (Album). Sire Records, Philadelphia, PA; 1980). The problem with development and implementation of large-scale policy into small communities is foundational to the basic conflict in an economics-driven soci- ety. That is, economic growth normally depletes resources and reduces ecosystem services leading to negative environmental externalities that, in turn, impacts social welfare. But national policy still places economic growth as a leading indicator of societal success, even if success is achieved to the detriment of the global scarcity of resources, contributing to child mortality, obesity, lack of access to clean water, unsafe communities, uncertain citizenship status, and similar concerns. All these negative environmental conditions crucially influence health conditions, whatever undeveloped, emerging, or industrialized country is considered. Reconciling the differences in this multidimensional political, social, economic, behavioral, life sci- ence, and public health dilemma is tricky, at best, due to governing models reliant on a foundation of economics, history, and mathematics-a triple bane of every scholar's existence. However, the opportunity to generate progressive and sustain- able change absent this foundation would otherwise be missed. Thus, this chapter introduces and then unfolds the economic problem in contrast to human develop- ment that is at the root of the challenge of implementing national economic policy and the local impact effecting general human development and quality of life. The chapter addresses the application of new metrics supporting economic, human and sustainable development and closes with the application of these metrics towards reasonable constraints of national equitable distribution and global economic expansion. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - The agricultural sector is of utmost importance for the expansion of African countries as it represents the main pillar of their economies. The problem though is the changing climatic conditions which can negatively impact on agricultural output and as a result these countries will be affected on both economic and social grounds. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between climate change and agriculture for the case of 20 African countries from 1995 to 2017. The results show a negative and significant relationship between temperature and agricultural output for the selected African countries. Further analysis of the results shows that human capital development contributes positively to the growth of the agricultural sector, while trade openness is observed to prevent its expansion. Hence, there is a need for better land management, governance, and irrigation systems, use of appropriate fertilizers as well as better infrastructure to boost agricultural yields and counter the negative impacts of climate change. Farmers’ education, use of information technology, and mechanization are also needed. Appropriate policies will help the African agricultural sector to become more productive and in the long term to ensure food security in the region. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - The existing works in endogenous growth have focused on technology and rarely on population impacts. In contrast, the research on environmental degradation caused by fossil fuel utilization has relied mostly on exogenous technology and population growth. Building upon the previous literature, I propose a dynamic growth model that allows the interaction between an economy and energy consumption of renewable and nonrenewable and the transitional path from one to another. I also allow endogenous population growth, where the population is affected by living standards and industrialization and indirectly natural resources through production, considering the trade-off between nonrenewable energy reserves and renewable resources. By creating a feedback loop from the population to the level of industrialization and GDP in this setup, GDP per capita’s growth rate is lower under endogenous population scenario relative to exogenous population growth. This particular outcome conveys that many projections for future energy use might overestimate our energy use, hence the economic and environmental costs. Firms utilize nonrenewable energy more intensively in a decentralized model since they do not fully internalize the negative externalities that arise from using nonrenewable energy, unlike the social planner approach. Imposing carbon-tax elements on the energy producers’ profit would accelerate clean energy adaptation and sustain the fossil fuel resources for a more extended period while increasing the total welfare by 3%. It would also increase the individuals’ long-term total consumption. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Natural resources' importance in economic and social development has been a recurring theme in development and policy debate. While existing research on the 'resource curse' is inconclusive, many studies show that resource-rich countries have poor economic growth and development outcomes. Many of these studies, however, treat development outcomes as a byproduct of good resource governance, rather than investigating the relationship between resource governance and social impact or development outcomes. The primary goal of this research is to look into the relationship between political commitment and a variety of dimensions, including economic diversification, resource governance, fiscal sustainability, and social impact in resource-rich countries, with a focus on Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The study aims to address the lack of research and policy attention paid to the role of political commitment in mitigating the resource curse with a data span from 1980–2018. The study is motivated by the little research and policy attention to the role of political commitment in addressing the 'resource curse'.The findings show that the majority of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries in the study have low or very low levels of government commitment, as measured by the Natural Resource Political Commitment Index (NRPCI). Furthermore, the findings indicate that natural resource governance is complex; for example, Botswana has a high NRPCI score but a low social impact score, indicating that the benefits of the natural resource have not been felt in the lives of their citizens. This finding is still relevant in terms of policy implications. The index could be a useful tool in policymakers' hands as they attempt to address the multifaceted challenges that natural resource abundance developing and emerging countries face, as well as bring new perspectives to the natural resource curse research agenda. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - There is growing concern in Sri Lanka over the impact of climate change, variability and extreme weather events on food production, food security and livelihoods. The link between climate change and food security has been mostly explored in relation to impacts on crop production or food availability aspects of food security, with little focus on other key dimensions, namely food access and food utilization. This review, based on available literature, adopted a food system approach to gain a wider perspective on food security issues in Sri Lanka. It points to several climate-induced issues posing challenges for food security. These issues include declining agriculture productivity, food loss along supply chains, low livelihood resilience of the rural poor and prevalence of high levels of undernourishment and child malnutrition. Our review suggests that achieving food security necessitates action beyond building climate resilient food production systems to a holistic approach that is able to ensure climate resilience of the entire food system while addressing nutritional concerns arising from impacts of climate change. Therefore, there is a pressing need to work towards a climate-smart agriculture system that will address all dimensions of food security. With the exception of productivity of a few crop species, our review demonstrates the dearth of research into climate change impacts on Sri Lanka’s food system. Further research is required to understand how changes in climate may affect other components of the food system including productivity of a wider range of food crops, livestock and fisheries, and shed light on the causal pathways of climate-induced nutritional insecurity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This paper outlines a framework for studying the multiple interactions of broadly defined food systems with global environmental change and evaluating the major societal outcomes affected by these interactions: food security, ecosystem services and social welfare. In building the framework the paper explores and synthesizes disparate literature on food systems food security and global environmental change, bridging social science and natural science perspectives. This collected evidence justifies a representation of food systems, which can be used to identify key processes and determinants of food security in a given place or time, particularly the impacts of environmental change. It also enables analysis of the feedbacks from food system outcomes to drivers of environmental and social change, as well as tradeoffs among the food system outcomes themselves. In food systems these tradeoffs are often between different scales or levels of decision-making or management, so solutions to manage them must be context-specific. With sufficient empirical evidence, the framework could be used to build a database of typologies of food system interactions useful for different management or analytical purposes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Economic development accelerated by natural resource use has caused many undesirable environmental consequences such as reducing the living standards of individuals and threatening human health. Therefore, whether natural resource abundance is a curse for individuals' welfare and environmental sustainability is one of the crucial topics in the literature. This study investigates the impact of natural resources on environmental sustainability by adopting the newly developed Load Capacity Curve hypothesis in the resource-rich Sub-Saharan African countries for the period from 1990 to 2020 by utilizing a set of panel data methods. The main estimation results can be outlined as follows: (i) cointegration tests show the existence of the long-run relationship between variables, (ii) the Load Capacity Curve Hypothesis is valid in the model, and (iii) natural resource rent, energy consumption, and population density reduce environmental sustainability, (iv) empirical estimations for robustness check greatly confirm the finding obtained by baseline estimations. Therefore, policy-makers in the resource-rich Sub-Saharan African countries should focus on establishing mechanisms for internalizing negative externalities of natural resource rent. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Rapidly progressing climate heating as well as ongoing economic and population growth exacerbate the challenges of reconciling the multitude of land functions and services. Terrestrial ecosystems support biodiversity and climate regulation and deliver resources like food, energy, or fiber, while infrastructures proliferate. Navigating the resulting “global land squeeze” aims to maintain a healthy biosphere while supporting land-based services for a decent living for us all. To elucidate trade-offs and synergies related to the global land squeeze, we discuss key components of the land system and their interplay, trade-offs, past trends, and current geographical patterns. We examine three social-science concepts and explore their suitability for navigating the land squeeze and identify demand-side strategies, like reducing overconsumption, that may emerge as no-regret solutions in industrialized contexts. We conclude that enhancing the analytical capabilities to steer land system change requires shifting from isolated driver-impact analyses toward the ex ante integration of societal and ecological sustainability targets on an equal footing. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The ocean is a major food source for the 7.7 billion people on Earth yet not widely and effectively recognized in global food systems. The ocean is threatened by the impacts of climate change, in particular ocean acidification, jeopardizing food security of coastal populations. The ocean has absorbed approximately 30 per cent of emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide, changing ocean chemistry and leading to ocean acidification. The potential consequences of ocean acidification on marine bivalves have been largely overlooked. This chapter emphasizes the role of the ocean as a provider of nutrition and an important source for fulfilling the human right to food for many, and highlights the risks created by the adverse impact of ocean acidification on food security and sustainable ocean management. The chapter will first examine generally the overlooked role of the ocean for food security and the right to food. Second, it will look at the international legal framework related to the protection of the ocean and fisheries as well as the climate change legal framework. This will be presented in three distinct but relevant areas: (i) protection of the ocean and fisheries, (ii) climate change, environment and sustainable development, and (iii) international human rights mechanisms, specifically the right to food. The aim is to establish a synergy among those areas for better legal protection of the ocean against ocean acidification and a human rights-based approach to food security. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2021.

AB  - Climate smart agriculture (CSA) embodies a blend of innovations, practices, systems, and investment programmes that are used to mitigate against the adverse effects of climate change and variability on agriculture for sustained food production. Food crop production under various climate change scenarios requires the use of improved technologies that are called climate smart agriculture to ensure increased productivity under adverse conditions of increased global temperatures, frequent and more intense storms, floods and drought stresses. This chapter summarizes available information on climate change and climate smart agriculture technologies. It is important to evaluate each climate change scenario and provide technologies that farmers, research scientists, and policy drivers can use to create the desired climate smart agriculture given the array of tools and resources available. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Jason Holt and Marc Ramsay.

AB  - The planet earth, on which we live in communities, is being increasingly 'ruptured' because of human activities; its carrying capacity is under great stress because of demographic pressures. The pressure is especially affecting the people living in the dry areas because of the marginal and fragile nature of the resources they have access to. There are over 2,000 million hectares of land that have been degraded, with a loss of agrobiodiversity, increased water scarcity and increased natural resource destruction. Superimposed on this is the fact that the neglectful and exploitive use of natural resources has set the train of global climate change in motion. It is anticipated that the impact of climate change will cut across all boundaries. Crops, cropping systems, rotations and biota will undergo transformation. To maintain the balance in the system, there is a need for new knowledge, alternative policies and institutional changes. The marginalized people in dry areas are likely to be most seriously hit by the shifts in moisture and temperature regimes as a result of the global climate change. To help them cope with the challenges, there is a need for a new paradigm in agricultural research and technology transfer that makes full use of modern science and technology in conjunction with traditional knowledge. This necessitates more investment by international agencies and national governments for supporting the relevant integrated research and sustainable development efforts, with full participation of the target communities. Only such an approach can enable the vulnerable communities of the dryland areas to use the natural resources in a sustainable manner and thus help protect the environment for future generations. The clock is ticking and the future of the world lies in the collective responsibility and wisdom of all nations on this planet. This should be reflected in the endorsement of a solid future plan. © 2012 El-Beltagy and Madkour; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Regions affected by resource scarcity, poverty, and land-use conflicts need to advocate the merits of practices strongly grounded in sustainable land management. This review paper provides an analysis of agroforestry as an integrated system embedded in complex relations between resource uses in the Water–Energy–Land–Food (WELF) nexus. Using the African Sahel region as a case study, the paper explains the need for understanding land management practices, such as agroforestry, through the lens of trade-offs and benefits inherent in the WELF nexus. Agroforestry practices are demonstrated to be valuable interventions leading to i) resilience to climate stresses, ii) water, energy, and food securities, iii) mitigation of resource-oriented harbingers of conflicts and iv) development opportunities. These goals can also yield valuable results in terms of promoting sustainable development, i.e. functional ecosystems, livelihoods, and human security. Two overarching sub-nexuses, namely agroforestry–food–energy and agroforestry–food–water–climate, are identified in the Sahelian context and conceptualized. Primarily, the trade-offs outlined within these sub-nexuses are fuelwood vs. crops, use of land for more forests vs. more cropping, and water availability for agroforestry vs. agroforestry impacts on the water cycle. Despite the positive outcomes and opportunities, agroforestry systems in the Sahel still face some challenges such as vague land use rights, inadequate capacities and lack of investments. Policy recommendations are synthesized at three levels. This synthesis involves remedies to lessen pressures at the interlinks of WELF resource use, overarching remedies in the two sub-nexuses, and remedies across all the sectors and issues for improving agroforestry outcomes. Optimal remedies stress the importance of choosing the right land, water and plant combinations as well as incorporating efficiency measures and alternative sources. A successful agroforestry system is characterized by a conducive environment at the farm level in terms of institutions, management, enhancing the farmer's capacity, and good infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This comprehensive document explores the multifaceted implications of food overproduction on soil sustainability, encompassing environmental, soci-etal, and economic aspects. It delves into the global landscape of food produc-tion, highlighting key statistics and the leading countries in this domain. The Euro-pean Union’s directives, strategies, and action plans related to food production are discussed, emphasizing the Farm to Fork Strategy, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. Furthermore, the document scrutinizes the environmental consequences of food overproduction, including deforestation, soil degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions from food waste. It also examines the societal impacts, such as food insecurity, malnutrition, and economic disparities resulting from market dynamics. The economic ramifications of food overproduc-tion, including direct economic losses, waste management costs, and the adverse effects on farmers’ livelihoods, are thoroughly analyzed. In particular, the document emphasizes the critical importance of soil health in sustainable food production. It discusses how soil degradation, erosion, pollution, and acidification are intercon-nected with food production practices and explores the global implications of these soil-related issues. Ultimately, this document underscores the urgent need for tran-sitioning towards sustainable and regenerative agriculture practices to address the challenges posed by food overproduction. © 2024 by Springer International Publishing.

AB  - The need for wholescale energy transitions across the globe is now clear, but there is still much debate about how best to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Carbon-pricing has so far been unable to avert the coming climate catastrophe. Instead supply-side, managed decline of the fossil fuel sector and proposals for Green New Deals, or Just Transition are gaining steam among academics, policy communities, and movements and even entering mainstream politics. In this article, I review three main approaches to energy transition and highlight their underlying goals and assumptions. I argue that movements for energy transition must center social and economic justice in their struggles if they want to gain broad-based appeal. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - India is among the significant agricultural economies of the world. The Green Revolution of the 1970s facilitated this overpopulated country to overcome the imminent threats of food insecurity while ensuring optimal crop production. India’s economy is majorly agricultural, with more than 70% of its population directly or indirectly dependent on farm-based livelihoods and their associated options. Agricultural production has increased manifold over the last few decades due to land use cover changes, conversion of forest lands into agricultural lands, technological improvement influencing productivity, quality inputs, intensive farm policies, and exponential population growth. This fast-paced growth, however, has detrimentally impacted India’s natural resources. Agriculture accounts for 18% of India’s total greenhouse gas emissions, as communicated to UNFCCC. We need to mitigate climate change and increase the production of food and energy for a nation projected to exceed a population of 10 billion people by 2050. Meeting the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), which aims for holistic and inclusive growth, can help us overcome this challenge. Many countries have adopted and implemented national policies based on efficient resource management by ensuring maximum resource generation and minimal waste production. Agriculture is one of the bulkiest socio-economic sectors with total biomass production. India is, in fact, among the top rice cultivating countries in the world. Agricultural waste management, however, is a severe problem. Farmers often dispose of the vast amounts of rice straw generated as the main crop leftover by resorting to environmentally harmful approaches such as stubble burning. Many recent efforts have successfully converted stubble to biogas, different biofuels, fertilizers, and growth medium. Proper, sustainable, and scientific agricultural waste management can diversify livelihood options and contribute significantly to new emerging markets. This discussion summarizes agro-residue management strategies such as bioconversion of stubble into organic manure, electricity, and biogas. The chapter would further document such success stories practised by Indian farmers on the field, which has heavily reduced agrowaste generation and open new vistas of opportunities while ensuring sustainable development and facilitation of green growth of Indian economy. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - -Enhancing the productivity of rainfed crops, especially rice, while coping with climate adversities and saving critical natural resources is essential for ensuring the food and nutrition security of a growing population. With this context, the present study was undertaken to validate promising farm innovation and adaptation practices used by small-medium landholding farmers for rice cultivation in eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP), north India, as well as to examine the sustainability of innovative practices for large-scale adoption. For this, a 3-year study comprising extensive field surveys and experiments was undertaken to compare single transplantation (ST) and double transplantation (DT) in rice along with organic addition (farm-yard manure, FYM) on crop growth, yield, climate resilience, soil quality, and overall sustainability i.e., social (women involvements and labour productivity), environmental (water productivity and nutrient use efficiency), and economic (benefit:cost ratio) dimensions of sustainability. Field experiments were conducted in triplicate using two local rice varieties (MotiNP-360 and Sampurna Kaveri) in two agroclimatic zones, namely the middle Gangetic plains and the Vindhyan zone, in the Mirzapur district of eastern Uttar Pradesh. The DT practices of rice with and without farm yard manure (FYM) (replacing at a dose of 25% NPK) were evaluated over conventional methods of rice cultivation (i.e., ST, as control) and analysis was done periodically. The DT practice improved growth (p < 0.05), percent fertile tiller and grain (p < 0.05), and rice yield (15–20% higher than ST), while also improving soil quality, yield indices, water and labour productivity, and the benefit-cost ratio. The DT practice also resulted in early maturity (10–15 days earlier than ST), created more labour days for women, decreased lodging and pest/disease incidence, as well as a subsequent reduction in the use of synthetic chemical pesticides and associated environmental costs. Importantly, the residual effects of FYM application significantly improved (p < 0.05) the grain yield in subsequent years of cropping. Optimizing DT cultivation practices, preferably with FYM input for various agro-climatic regions, is essential for large-scale sustainable rice production under changing climatic conditions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Water is an important factor of production contributing both directly and indirectly to economic activity across all sectors and regions of the global economy. Water scarcity may therefore go beyond having important consequences for people, society and ecological systems but may also pose a threat to economic growth. Using the latest IPCC RCP projections and the OECD Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) for population growth and economic output, we develop a multi-regional input-output model to estimate future demand for water resources across different countries and sectors of the global economy. Model results show that most countries will experience declining water availability, particularly those countries that experience a confluence of factors including low fresh water availability, high climate change impacts, and growing consumption patterns. We show that virtual water trade and improved water efficiency has potential to alleviate the worst effects of water scarcity for wealthy countries but may have limited effect on poorer countries. The analysis concludes that the most important driver of future water scarcity is economic growth, which overwhelms any realistic savings that can be made from increased technological progress and improvements to water efficiency. Population growth and climate change are also shown to be important drivers of future water scarcity, particularly over the long-run. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ozone pollution is a growing problem in many developing countries posing challenges not only to air quality but also affecting agricultural productivity and human well-being. This is the first study in the Indo-Gangetic Plain exploring how the spatial variation and severity of tropospheric ozone affect both wheat yield and all-cause mortality. We estimated that ozone-related cumulative crop production loss for wheat in selected districts of IGP was 3.4 million tonnes during the study period (2019–2021), which amounted to 923 million USD. The production-weighted Relative Yield Loss (RYL) for wheat in the IGP was 9.3 % in 2019, 12.8 % in 2020, and 11.3 % in 2021. The losses incurred in 2021 could contribute to fulfilling the wheat requirements of 11.4 million people. We also assess the health and economic gains resulting from the attainment of the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines (WHO AQG) for ozone concentrations. It is estimated that interventions that achieve AQG would have averted 11,407 premature deaths in 2021 translating into an impressively large health and economic gain. The annual benefits in 2021 totaled to 34 billion USD. We observe that Uttar Pradesh experienced the highest losses, both in terms of crop damage and premature deaths. Our study observes that implementing policies to prepone the planting of wheat enhances food security by mitigating yield losses. Mitigating the health impact of ambient ozone necessitates a reduction in anthropogenic emissions and to attain this objective, we propose adopting an exposure-integrated source reduction approach. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Systems perspectives are fundamental in driving technological improvements and yield-enhancing strategies that improve agricultural productivity. These can resolve farmer's problems and are important pathways for sustaining food and nutritional security for human welfare in Asia. The essential determinants of this objective are the capacity to efficiently manage the natural resource base (land, crops, animals, and water) to resolve constraints to farming systems, and notably the integration of multiple research and development (R&D) issues through all levels of formal and non-formal learning systems. Both formal and informal education systems are important, with the former relating more to universities and colleges, and the latter to the intermediate level. Graduates from this level have the primary responsibility of introducing improved technologies and change to farmers, mainly along production and disciplinary pathways. The traditional research-extension-farmer model for technology delivery is no longer acceptable, due to "top down" extension functions and prescriptions, ineffectiveness to cope with the dynamics of production systems, complex interactions within the natural resources, effects of climate change and globalisation. There are also reservations on the technical capacity and skills of extension agents, constraints identification, methods for technology diffusion and dissemination, and innovative use of beneficial technological improvements that can directly respond to the needs of small farmers, and impact on subsistence agriculture. Agricultural education and systems perspectives are therefore an overriding compelling necessity which transcends prevailing limitations to waning agriculture and rural growth. Their wider recognition and applications provides an important means to maximise efficiency in the potential use; of the natural resources, increase engagement and investments in agriculture, promote ways to become more self-reliant in the development of crucial new technologies and intensification. These together can meet the challenges of the future and overcome the legacy of continuing poverty, food and nutritional insecurity. Asian farming systems, with their diversity of crops and animals, traditional methods, multiple cropanimal interactions, numerous problems of farmers present increasingly complex issues of natural resource management (NRM) and the environment. Many if not all of these can only be resolved by interdisciplinary R&D, which overcomes a major weakness of many R&D programmes presently and in the past. Improved education and training is a powerful and important driver of community-based participation aimed at enhancing sustainable food security, poverty reduction and social equity in which the empowerment of women in activities that support organising themselves is also an important pathway to enhance self-reliance and their contribution to agriculture. A vision for the future in which improved agricultural education in a systems context can provide the pathway to directly benefit the revitalisation of agriculture and agricultural development is proposed with a three-pronged strategy as follows: • Define policy for the development of appropriate curricular for formal agricultural education that provides strong multi-disciplinary orientation and improved understanding of the natural resources (land, crops, animals and water) and their interactions • Organise formal degree education and specialisation at the university level that reflects strong training in understanding of agricultural systems; systems perspectives, methodologies and their application, and • Define non-formal education and training needs that can be intensified at different levels, including the trainin of trainers as agents of change. The agenda and strategies for improving agriculture needs to take a holistic and innovative view of ways to transform the diminishing resource base, potential of rainfed areas to increase food production, improved yield-enhancing technology application including the use of ruminants as the entry point for development, poverty complex, food and nutrition security, and environmental management.

AB  - Global agriculture is facing growing challenges at the nexus of interconnected food, energy and water systems, including but not limited to persistent food insecurity and diet-related diseases; growing demands for energy and consequences for climate change; and declining water resources, water pollution, floods and droughts. Further, soil degradation and biodiversity loss are both triggers for and consequences of these problems. In this commentary, we argue that expanding agroecological principles, tools, and technologies and enhancing biological diversity can address these challenges and achieve better socioeconomic outcomes. Agroecology is often described as multi- or transdiscplinary, and applies ecological principles to the design and management of agricultural systems through scientific research, practice and collective action. While agroecology has roots in the study of food systems, agricultural land use has many direct and indirect linkages to water and energy systems that could benefit from agroecological insights, including use of water resources and the development of bio-based energy products. Although opportunities from the science and the practice of agroecology transcend national boundaries, obstacles to widespread adoption vary. In this article, we therefore focus on the United States, where key barriers include a shortage of research funds, limited supporting infrastructure, and cultural obstacles. Nevertheless, simply scaling up current models of agricultural production and land use practices will not solve many of the issues specific to food related challenges nor would such an approach address related energy and water concerns. We conclude that a first critical step to discovering solutions at the food, energy, water nexus will be to move past yield as a sole measure of success in agricultural systems, and call for more holistic considerations of the co-benefits and tradeoffs of different agricultural management options, particularly as they relate to environmental and equity outcomes.

AB  - Transitioning to a low carbon energy future is essential to meet the Paris Agreement targets and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To understand how societies can undertake this transition, energy models have been developed to explore future energy scenarios. These models often focus on the techno-economic aspects of the transition and overlook the long-term implications on both society and the natural environment. Without a holistic approach, it is impossible to evaluate the trade-offs, as well as the co-benefits, between decarbonisation and other policy goals. This paper presents the Energy Scenario Evaluation (ESE) framework which can be used to assess the impact of energy scenarios on society and the natural environment. This conceptual framework utilises interdisciplinary qualitative and quantitative methods to determine whether an energy scenario is likely to lead to a publicly acceptable and sustainable energy transition. Using the SDGs, this paper illustrates how energy transitions are interconnected with human development and the importance of incorporating environmental and socio-economic data into energy models to design energy scenarios which meet other policy priorities. We discuss a variety of research methods which can be used to evaluate spatial, environmental, and social impacts of energy transitions. By showcasing where these impacts will be experienced, the ESE framework can be used to facilitate engagement and decision-making between policymakers and local communities, those who will be directly affected by energy transitions. Outputs of the ESE framework can therefore perform an important role in shaping feasible and energy transitions which meet the Paris Agreement targets and SDGs. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The ecology and all of its components are suffering greatly as a result of the unchecked speed of development. At this rate, environmental degradation will have an impact on humanity and associated fields. In order to prevent the consequences of expansion from pushing the environment into a situation from which it is incapable of recovering, there should be ongoing, earnest efforts made towards sustainable development. The three pillars of ecodevelopment are the environment, humanity, and economy. A stable growth rate is necessary to attain a just balance between these pillars. Since agriculture employs the majority of the population, it also has an impact on the balance of the ecosystem. Because every unplanned step towards progress puts us back in the environmental front, we must thus be mindful of the boundaries of environmental challenges in order to achieve equitable economic growth. The hope for sustainable development lies in decreased deforestation, greater food security, conservative agricultural practices, the use of biopesticides, and prudent use of natural resources. To be effective, environmental policy probably needs to employ a variety of tools, each addressing a distinct aspect of the issue and attempting to minimise redundancies and pointless regulations. Appropriately pricing environmental inputs facilitates sustainable resource provision and use management. Long-term corporate investment in new technology and innovation is encouraged by a consistent and clear environmental policy, which also increases investment certainty. Environmental and economic success are interdependent. Economic activity and advancement depend on the natural environment because it provides the resources needed to produce goods and services and because it processes and absorbs waste and pollution, which are unwanted byproducts. This paper focuses on how environmental assets assist control risks associated with social and economic activities, flood risks, local climate regulation (temperature and air quality), and the availability of clean water and other resources. © 2024 E3S Web of Conferences

AB  - In the beginning of the 1990s, after a traumatic modern history of conflicts and genocides, the Kingdom of Cambodia, with the support of the international community, entered an era of relative peace. Cambodia is endowed with valuable natural resources and biodiversity. Over the past decade, however, economic development has relied primarily on the unsustainable exploitation of these resources. Current trends in the use of resources in forestry, fishery, and agricultural land are unsustainable. The central position of the article is that resource appropriation by the political, economic, and military elites has gradually excluded the majority of the population from the country's forests, fisheries, and arable areas. A common pattern of unsustainable extraction and inequitable access characterizes the exploitation of these resources. The article discusses policy implications for the government of Cambodia and the international donor community. Environmental reforms will face strong resistance from the elites, as institutional and social change may prove politically and economically onerous.

AB  - Globalization, climate change and increasing populations have put severe pressure on service delivery and water management in developing countries. This is not unique to South Africa, as the country is still plagued by significant inequalities and compromised service delivery relating to water access and sanitation. Despite these challenges, clean water and access to sufficient and safe sanitation facilities remain crucial for human health, food production, industrial output and social stability. As such, the main purpose of the study was to analyse the impact of water access and sanitation on local economic development (LED) within the Sedibeng District Municipality in South Africa. The study followed a quantitative approach using annual time series data between 1995 to 2018. Various econometric methods were employed including unit root tests, ARDL Bounds test for co-integration, an Error Correction Model (ECM) as well as Toda-Yamamoto granger causality tests. The results show the presence of both long and short run relationships between the dependent and independent variables. Having access to water facilities within households as well as quality sanitation contributes positively to the economic and social wellbeing of the region. Causality results further indicated a bi-directional relationship between water access and the local economic development index highlighting the interdependence of these aspects. The findings reiterate the significance of these resources to the wellbeing of the region. Not only does the access to these basic services contribute to the quality of life for many but its linkages within various economic domains such as diversification, energy utilization, employment and productivity make them vital drivers for the region's prosperity. As such, water and sanitation management should receive high priority in local stakeholders' policy agenda. Focus should be shifted to the implementation of sustainable water practices and improved sanitation infrastructure development to enhance the economic and social sustainability of the region. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - In a context of fast population growth, urbanization, sluggish agricultural productivity growth and climate change, Africa is facing a major food security challenge in the coming decades. This chapter breaks down this complex challenge into what is required and what is desired for food systems transformation, considering both consumption- and production-related aspects. We argue that efforts to move food systems towards greater food and nutrition security should consider four interrelated domains: agriculture, ecosystems, trade and nutrition. By taking concrete examples from this volume’s 21 chapters, we discuss challenges, threats and opportunities for each of these domains, as well as synergies and trade-offs between them. We also stress that food systems transformation hinges on powerful macro-trends in the spheres of domestic governance, international arenas and climate change. We conclude by proposing four potential drivers of change: crisis breeding change, a diffusion of best practices (‘ripple effects’), regional coordination and global coordination. While we argue that each of these drivers will ultimately yield positive outcomes, the human and environmental costs involved depend a lot on levels of ambition and coordination that is achieved. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Michiel de Haas and Ken E.

AB  - Specialization and intensification in agriculture have increased productivity but have also led to the spread of monocultural systems, simplifying production but reducing genetic diversity. The purpose of this study was to propose crop diversification as a tool to increase biodiversity and achieve sustainable and resilient intensive agriculture, particularly in areas with water scarcity. In this paper, a combined life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) applied to evaluate the environmental and economic sustainability of a differentiated system of cultivation were (pomegranates, almonds and olives), according to modern intensive and super-intensive cropping systems. Based on the results obtained, it is deduced that pomegranate cultivation generated the highest environmental load, followed by almonds and olives. From the financial analysis, it emerged that almond farming is the most profitable, followed by pomegranate and olive farming. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is an arid and hyper arid region with nineteen countries/states with annual renewable freshwater per capita below water scarcity threshold (1000 m3/year). Groundwater is a key resource in the MENA region for improving water supply and agriculture uses. Due to the scarcity of renewable freshwater, increasing demand, and stress on surface water, nearly twelve states primarily depend on groundwater as a primary source of freshwater. Groundwater resources account for more than 80% of freshwater withdrawals in six states. There are 43 transboundary aquifer systems within the region. About 50% of the MENA region’s aquifer systems are non-renewable with over-abstraction which lead to sever drop in water table and deterioration in groundwater quality. In eight states, about 85% of agriculture irrigation water comes from groundwater compared to a global average of about 35% which also affects the food security. This is exacerbated by low water use productivity within the region with an average of about $0.25/m3 compared to $0.68/m3 globally. Groundwater valuation studies indicating that the economic value of groundwater is some states ranges between $0.52 and 0.85/m3. Economic valuation of groundwater supports planners and decision-makers in allocating and prioritizing available limited water resources in different developing sectors. Also, it will help in comparing between investing in groundwater protection with other environmental matters, and in balancing groundwater withdraw with conservation it for future generations. This chapter will assess how groundwater declining and deterioration due to increased demands, inefficient use and impacts of climate change should prompt MENA states to explore innovative and integrated governance frameworks to improve the management and ensure equitable access to strategic resources for both current and future generations. The groundwater importance for water security in the region should enhance the use of innovative technologies and dedicated funding towards integrated water resources management and heightened regional cooperation. Many countries in the region started to regulate groundwater resources with emphasis on allocation, well drilling, licensing, metering and sometimes pricing. However, the enforcement of these regulations is still weak. The depletion and quality deterioration of many aquifers are increasing the abstraction costs which affecting the social differentiation, as smaller farmers are pumped out and foreshadows a gradual collapse of the groundwater economy within the region. Few countries in the region still subside the groundwater abstraction which also affects the sustainability of this limited resource. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - This paper offers a field tested community environmental policing model to address the pressing environmental management challenges of reducing e-waste burning in informal e-waste hubs, and enforcement against informal polluting industries more broadly. This is based on our intervention to reduce e-waste burning in a substantial informal e-waste hub in the West Bank, Palestine, a 45 km2 region in which an estimated 5–10 metric tonnes of cables are burnt daily, causing serious environmental and public health consequences. In analogous e-waste hubs in the global South, environmental management solutions have focused on economically attractive alternatives to replace cable burning or policies that integrate informal recyclers with formal e-waste management systems—achieving little success. Our paper describes a two-pronged intervention in Palestine’s e-waste hub, which reduced e-waste burning by 80% through a combination of economically competitive cable grinding services and an “active” community environmental policing initiative that lowered barriers to and successfully advocated for governmental policing of e-waste burning. Our discussion of this intervention addresses the community environmental policing literature, which has documented few successes stories of real improvements to the enforcement of environmental violations. We argue that existing strategies have relied on “passive” approaches comprised of monitoring and reporting environmental violations to advocate for change. Our strategy offers a template to improve outcomes through a more “active” approach, moving from monitoring environmental violations through understanding the rationale and dynamics of violators, identifying environmental policing barriers, and implementing a feasible and persuasive strategy to overcome them. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Agricultural mechanization is on the rise in Africa. A widespread replacement of manual labor and animal traction will change the face of African agriculture. Despite this potentially transformative role, only a few studies have looked at the effects of mechanization empirically, mostly focusing on yields and labor alone. This is the first paper that explores perceived agronomic, environmental, and socioeconomic effects together, thereby revealing linkages and trade-offs, some of which have been hitherto unknown. Data were collected using a novel data collection method called “participatory impact diagrams” in four countries: Benin, Kenya, Nigeria, and Mali. In 129 gendered focus group discussions, 1330 respondents from 87 villages shared their perceptions on the positive and negative effects of agricultural mechanization, and developed causal impact chains. The results suggest that mechanization is likely to have more far-reaching agronomic, environmental, and socioeconomic consequences than commonly assumed. Most perceived effects were positive, suggesting that mechanization can help to reduce poverty and enhance food security but other effects were negative such as deforestation, soil erosion, land-use conflicts, and gender inequalities. Accompanying research and policy efforts, which reflect variations in local agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions, are needed to ensure that mechanization contributes to an African agricultural transformation that is sustainable from a social, economic, and environmental perspective. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Increasing concerns about global climate change, energy security, high oil prices, and declining oil reserves have prompted a shift toward biofuels as a feasible and renewable alternative to fossil fuels. In light of the current state of the biofuel production technology, this paper examines why current measures of biofuel production, consumption, and trades are still inadequate to lower the level of greenhouse gas emissions to the extent necessary to tackle climate change and to ensure a sustainable future. The paper discusses in depth various issues and limitations associated with the current state of the biofuel play and highlights the importance of the much-needed switch toward the next-generation biofuels that promises to show much higher potential to combat economic, social, and environmental issues. It analyzes the pros and cons of the current biofuel policies in place for the key players in detail and shows how policies can have a significant impact on poverty, welfare, and employment prospects around the world. The paper emphasizes the role that international biofuel trade plays in enhancing economic welfare both domestically and internationally and recommends the type of policies needed to promote biofuel trades and to enhance the production of the next-generation biofuel. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - African countries are consistently trying to leverage industrialization to advance their economic development. Despite possessing favorable factors such as abundant natural resources, a surplus of low-cost labor, and an increasing number of established Special Economic Zones (SEZs), African countries are yet to fully maximize their potential and achieve sustainable and inclusive industrialization. This study explores the comparative advantages of African countries to determine the types of SEZs that can effectively accelerate industrialization. By leveraging the unique strengths and resources of each country, customized strategies for SEZs can be developed to attract investments, promote technological advancements, and foster sustainable economic growth. The research utilizes the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) matrix, which is grounded in Ricardian trade theory, examining trade data spanning from 2011 to 2021 to evaluate the competitive export capabilities of various countries. The findings consistently reveal that the selected countries (Ghana, Ethiopia, and South Africa) possess a significant and consistent comparative advantage in natural and agricultural resources compared to other sectors. Establishing SEZs that focus on these sectors can generate substantial socio-economic impacts, including attracting investments, creating employment opportunities, enhancing export capacities, stimulating economic growth, fostering linkages, facilitating skills and technology transfer, promoting spillover effects, encouraging specialization, developing infrastructure, and supporting value addition in agribusinesses. The result of this study will contribute to policy discussions and aid decision-making processes for policymakers, investors, and development practitioners in their efforts to advance industrial development across Africa. © 2024

AB  - The financial system has an important role for economic growth and social welfare of individuals, households, enterprises, civic and public institutions. Despite its imperfection, the financial system has the power to help us create a better and a more fair society, having an essential role in the development of wealthy economies. The recent financial crisis is the largest, most complex and delicate challenge of the current period. Authorities are deeply concerned with improving the existing framework of supervision and regulation and develop strategy programs in order to ensure stability and sustainable growth throughout Europe. The European Council has adopted the Europe 2020 Strategy which is the EU’s growth agenda for the current decade. It aims at overcoming the negative effects of the global financial crisis and emphasizes sustainable economic development and social inclusion. The fundamentals of the Europe 2020 Strategy are the five key objectives: employment, R&D expenses, climate change and energy sustainability, education and fighting poverty and social exclusion. Reviewing the impact of financial stability on social and economic development reveals low employment rates both for the EU and Romania. Current descriptive statistics analysis shows that the employment rate is higher for a higher level of education of the population considered sustaining education and training development as fundamental priority. Although R&D and innovation are key policy components of the Europe 2020 strategy, the rates are still low, especially in Romania. Having more innovative products and services on the market addresses job creation through increased industrial competitiveness, productivity and efficient use of resources. © 2017, Editura Lumen.

AB  - This is one of the first books to address how gender plays a role in helping to achieve the sustainable use of natural resources. The contributions collected here deal with the struggles of women and men to negotiate such forces as global environmental change, economic development pressures, discrimination and stereotyping about the roles of women and men, and diminishing access to natural resources-not in the abstract but in everyday life. Contributors are concerned with the lived complexities of the relationship between gender and sustainability. Bringing together case studies from Asia and Latin America, this valuable collection adds new knowledge to our understanding of the interplay between local and global processes. Organized broadly by three major issues-forests, water, and fisheries-the scholarship ranges widely: the gender dimensions of the illegal trade in wildlife in Vietnam; women and development issues along the Ganges River; the role of gender in sustainable fishing in the Philippines; women's inclusion in community forestry in India; gender-based confrontations and resistance in Mexican fisheries; environmentalism and gender in Ecuador; and women's roles in managing water scarcity in Bolivia and addressing sustainability in shrimp farming in the Mekong Delta. Together these chapters show why gender issues are important for understanding how communities and populations deal daily with the challenges of globalization and environmental change. Through their rich ethnographic research, the contributors demonstrate that gender analysis offers useful insights into how a more sustainable world can be negotiated-one household and one community at a time. © 2012 The Arizona Board of Regents.

AB  - The extent to which nations and regions can actively shape the future or must passively respond to global forces is a topic of relevance to current discourses on climate change, ecosystems services, and human well-being. In Australia, climate change has been identified as the greatest threat to the ecological resilience of the Great Barrier Reef and the multiple ecosystem services it provides, but is exacerbated by regional and local pressures. In this chapter, we discuss previous applications of scenario analysis and describe a case study we undertook to explore how two key uncertainties may influence these threats and their impact on the Great Barrier Reef and adjacent catchment's ecosystem services in the future. These two uncertainties were whether (1) global development and (2) Australian development are defined and pursued primarily in terms of economic growth or broader concepts of human well-being and environmental sustainability, and, in turn, how climate change is managed and mitigated. We compared the implications of four scenarios for marine and terrestrial ecosystem services and human well-being. The results suggest that while regional actions can partially offset global inaction on climate change until about mid-century, there are probable threshold levels for marine ecosystems, beyond which the Great Barrier Reef will become a fundamentally different system by 2100 if climate change is not curtailed. Management that can respond to pressures at both global and regional scales will be needed to maintain the full range of ecosystem services. It is possible to maintain human well-being even while some ecosystem services decline, but only if regional management is strong. The future of the region depends largely on whether national and regional decision makers choose to be active future 'makers' or passive future 'takers' in responding to global drivers of change. The chapter concludes by discussing potential avenues for using these scenarios for further discussion and consensus building with the Great Barrier Reef region's stakeholders. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the unequal distribution of climate change damages in the world and we examine how the underlying costs can spread from a vulnerable to a non-vulnerable country through international trade. To focus on such indirect effects, we treat this topic in a North–South trade overlapping generations model in which the South is vulnerable to the damages entailed by global pollution while the North is not. We show that the impacts of climate change in the South can be sources of welfare loss for northern consumers in both the long and the short run. In the long run, an increase in the South’s vulnerability can reduce the welfare in the North economy even in the case in which it improves the terms of trade of the North. In the short run, the South’s vulnerability can also represent a source of intergenerational inequity in the North. Therefore, we emphasize the strong economic incentives for non-vulnerable—and a fortiori less vulnerable—economies to reduce the climate change damages on more vulnerable countries. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Revised and updated throughout, the fifth edition of this unique anthology examines global environmental politics from a range of perspectives-contemporary and classic, activist and scholarly-and reflects voices of the powerless and powerful. Paradigms of sustainability, environmental security, and ecological justice illustrate the many ways environmental problems and their solutions are framed in contemporary international debates about climate, water, forests, toxics, energy, food, biodiversity, and other environmental challenges of the twenty-first century. Organized thematically, the selections offer a truly global scope. Seventeen new readings discuss climate justice, environmental peacebuilding, globalization, land grabs, corporate environmentalism, climate adaptation, gender, disaster risk, resilience, and the future of global environmental politics in the wake of the “Rio+20" global summit of 2012.This book stresses the underlying questions of power, interests, authority, and legitimacy that shape environmental debates, and it provides readers with a global range of perspectives on the critical challenges facing the planet and its people. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The price volatility of fossil resources, the uncertainty of their long-term availability and the environmental, climatic and societal problems posed by their operation lead to the need of an energy transition enabling the development and utilization of other alternative and sustainable resources. Acknowledging that indirect land-use change can increase greenhouse gas emission, the European Union (EU) has reshaped its biofuel policy. It has set criteria for sustainability to ensure that the use of biofuels guarantees real carbon savings and protects biodiversity. From a sustainability perspective, biofuels and bioliquids offer indeed both advantages (e.g., more secure energy supply, emission reductions, reduced air pollution and production of high added-value molecules) as well as risks (monocultures, reduced biodiversity and even higher emissions through land use change). Approaching economic, environmental and social sustainability at the local level and in an integrated way should help to maximize benefits and minimize risks. This approach has been adopted and is described in the present work that combines chemical, biological, social and territorial studies on the management of pruning waste residues from olive trees in the Sierra Mágina in Spain. The biological and social analyses helped to orientate the research towards an attractive chemical process based on extraction and pyrolysis, in which high added value molecules are recovered and in which the residual biochar may be used as pathogen-free fertilizer. In this region where farmers face declining economic margins, the new intended method may both solve greenhouse gas emission problems and provide farmers with additional revenues and convenient fertilizers. Further research with a larger partnership will consolidate the results and tackle issues such as the logistics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The global industrial mining sector is, like other sectors, undergoing an unprecedented transformation pushed by global sustainability and climate challenges. The need to increase productivity and efficiency of mineral extraction along with increasing pressure from a wide range of stakeholders to decarbonise the industry and make mining practices more sustainable, accountable, and socially acceptable are driving the adoption of automation and digitalisation technologies as well as the electrification of equipment and the implementation of more sustainable energy solutions for the industry. Automation and digitalisation are changing the way minerals and metals are extracted and provide important tools for designing and implementing the mine of the future: a digitally integrated, autonomous mine where no humans need to be put in harm’s way and in which the connected systems are able to reduce the ever-increasing complexity to such an extent that improved decision-making can be realised in real time. Mining as an industry still has a way to go to reach the potential of automation and digitalisation on the one hand, and alternative drive systems and sustainable power generation on the other. This paper will give an overview of empirically derived leading technologies underlying the current transformation and will place them in the context of the data-information-value-chain that can provide a more systematic approach to describe the various technologies and, in particular, their interrelationships. This can support a better understanding of assessing the overall technological maturity of an operation, especially with respect to their evolution from automation of equipment towards autonomous systems. There is no reason to doubt that, from a technology perspective, the digitally connected, autonomous, and carbon-free mine have the potential to become a reality. Breakthrough effects can be expected to come not from any single technology but rather from successfully developing, implementing, and integrating the full suite of (available) automation and digitalisation technologies across entire mining operations and moving towards digitally integrated, autonomous systems considering the process and its interrelations holistically (Clausen et al. 2020b). However, in order to get there, mining companies need to consider not only the technological aspects of this transformation. For successfully responding to the changing landscape of stakeholder expectations and future-proofing the industry requires, the authors argue that mining companies need to adopt a mind-set of the human-centred climate smart mine (Clausen and Sörensen 2021). In addition, mining companies need to reconsider their role in the economic, social, and environmental ecosystem they are embedded in so they can break through traditions that keep them from successfully positioning themselves as builders of social value. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Sustainability is a contested concept that has been at the center of discussions of natural and social scientists for decades. Mainstream conceptualizations, predicated upon the “three-legged stool” and “triple bottom line model,” argue that questions of economic, social, and environmental sustainability are of equal importance. However, in actuality, the “economic” leg of the stool is given primacy in these analyses. These mainstream conceptions take for granted that economic means the capitalist system, failing to assess how its growth dynamics undermine sustainability. Capitalism, as a historically distinct political-economic system, depends on expropriation and exploitation, creating social inequalities and environmental degradation increasingly on a global scale. Critical sustainability confronts the logic of capital, directly challenging this very system in an effort to create substantive equality, meet human needs, and protect the conditions of life. © 2018, AESS.

AB  - The global food crisis is a stark reminder of the fragility of the global food system. The Global Food Crisis: Governance Challenges and Opportunities captures the debate about how to go forward and examines the implications of the crisis for food security in the world's poorest countries, both for the global environment and for the global rules and institutions that govern food and agriculture. In this volume, policy-makers and scholars assess the causes and consequences of the most recent food price volatility and examine the associated governance challenges and opportunities, including short-term emergency responses, the ecological dimensions of the crisis, and the longer-term goal of building sustainable global food systems. The recommendations include vastly increasing public investment in small-farm agriculture; reforming global food aid and food research institutions; establishing fairer international agricultural trade rules; promoting sustainable agricultural methods; placing agriculture higher on the post-Kyoto climate change agenda; revamping biofuel policies; and enhancing international agricultural policy-making. © 2009 by Wilfrid Laurier University Press.

AB  - A convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. It has been the core concept of the Milan Expo 2015, whose title, Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life, embodied the challenge to provide the world's growing population with a sustainable, secure supply of safe, nutritious, and affordable high-quality food using less land with lower inputs. Meeting the food security agenda using current agricultural production techniques cannot be achieved without serious degradation to the environment, including soil degradation, loss of biodiversity and climate change. Organic farming is seen as a solution to the challenge of sustainable food production, as it provides more nutritious food, with less or no pesticide residues and lower use of inputs. A limit of organic farming is its restricted capability of producing food compared to conventional agriculture, thus being an inefficient approach to food production and to food security. The authors maintain, on the basis of a scientific literature review, that organic soils tend to retain the physical, chemical and biological properties over the long term, while maintaining stable levels of productivity and thereby ensuring long-term food production and safety. Furthermore, the productivity gap of organic crops may be worked out by further investment in research and in particular into diversification techniques. Moreover, strong scientific evidence indicates that organic agricultural systems deliver greater ecosystem services and social benefits.

AB  - This Study investigates the role that agricultural cooperatives play in advancing entrepreneurship for increased food security and income, in the rural areas of developing countries. It examines cooperative member self-efficacy, entrepreneurship skills and attitudes, through self-evaluation of cooperative viability. Ergo, this article uncovers the challenges, local solutions and sources of resilience in the agricultural cooperatives of developing countries. Collected through a survey, primary and secondary data were analyzed using SPSS 23, and content analysis was performed on qualitative data. The results reveal a high self-efficacy for cooperative members and a high motivation for market development and profitability. Agricultural cooperatives lag behind in information and communication techniques (ICT), and have a limited capability to resolve challenges, yet they achieve income higher than the national average income per head per year. Despite its limitations, the study urges cooperatives to reject economic growth models that damage the environment and promote short-term economic growth against environmental susstainability. Future research directions and policymaking recommendations pertain to the need for innovation, self-coordination, and openning up and sharing to accompany economic, social, cultural and political self-development, in ways that respect, protect and adapt to nature, through resource conservation, restoration and protection. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Climate change is likely to exacerbate inequality and poverty in Global South cities despite the presence of international agreements and conventions to enhance sustainable development such as the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Moreover, replicating Global North development models in the Global South might not be sufficient to address the climate change and development aspirations in the context of Asia; hence, Global North innovation capabilities might not be sufficient to address Global South climate change challenges. This paper provides an inductive analysis of the innovations and policies that could facilitate improved climate change mitigation and adaptation in the context of developing Asian cities. The paper concludes that innovative climate change policies should utilise emerging climate finance mechanisms such as South-South climate finance modalities to promote community science/citizen science and social innovation rather than building hard infrastructure as this could improve the governance and distribution of resources in cities. © 2022 by IGI Global.

AB  - Urbanization and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are important global issues in the current “Anthropocene”. Climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated global urban problems and hindered the ability to meet SDGs on time, while the broad interlinkages between urbanization and the SDGs remain poorly understood. This study shows that among the interlinkages of urbanization with 17 SDGs, synergies are observed with 151 targets (89%), among which 67 (40%) have stronger synergies, and trade-offs are observed with 66 targets (39%), among which 31 (18%) have stronger trade-offs. Furthermore, the synergies and trade-offs between urbanization and the achievement of SDGs are specifically analyzed based on four fundamental interaction fields: (a) public health and social welfare equality; (b) energy consumption and economic growth; (c) natural resource use and ecological/environmental impacts; and (d) international cooperation for development. Finally, based on these analyses, we propose four recommendations for sustainable urbanization, including (a) shared well-being and spatial justice for urban and rural residents; (b) guiding green and low-carbon urban development; (c) building resilient cities; and (d) promoting multilateral cooperation in cities, which can contribute to the achievement of SDGs by 2030. © 2022

AB  - This article examines key aspects of the energy transition as a pathway towards sustainable development in the Latin American region. The main directions of energy transition are highlighted, the role of alternative energy as a crucial driver is explored, and an analysis of progress towards energy transition goals in Latin America is presented. The study identifies challenges hindering the energy transition, including climate change, financial constraints, technological limitations, socio-economic disparities, and organizational barriers. To address these issues, the following measures are proposed: improving the institutional framework; strengthening policies to attract investment, particularly foreign direct investment in projects developing alternative energy sources, including within regional integration unions (MERCOSUR, the Andean Community, the Pacific Alliance, CELAC, etc.); addressing natural and climatic challenges through the construction of energy storage facilities; increasing the role of national banks in addressing investment gaps in renewable energy projects; and enhancing international cooperation in developing renewable energy sources, both at regional and global levels. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Since independence, India achieved a distinction from ship-to-mouth status to self dependent, food surplus and net exporter of food grains in 69 years and recorded an all time high (285.2 million tonnes) production during 2018-19 from meagre 50.8 mt during 1950-51. In spite of spectacular success in food production over the years, it is a great challenge to sustain high production as well as enhance it further to meet the future requirement, as the population continues to grow steadily with an annual growth rate of 1.10% and expected to be 1.42 billion and 1.48 billion by 2025 and 2030, respectively, from 1.32 billion during 2017; coupled with enhanced consumption of food grains due to rising income, necessitating an increase of 4.5% and 15.7% by 2020 and 2030, respectively, over the present food production. It is a great challenge in view of climate change, diminishing and degrading land and water resources, increasing biotic and abiotic stresses and loss of bio-diversity. The present paper discusses the trend of production and productivity of food crops from 1950-51 to 2018-19; assess the contribution of seed to food production, seed chain, quality seed production and scope of quality seed for enhancing farmers' income and future strategies for seed research, production and development to sustain food production. Requisite assets such as a strong crop specific cultivar development programmes, 850 high yielding food crop varieties comprising 657 of cereals and 193 of pulses released during the last six years, robust and vibrant seed systems, quality regulatory mechanism, globally competitive seed sector and the largest arable land with 46 soil types across 15 agro-climatic zones favouring seed production of diverse crops are available for sustaining high food production and meet the future demand for seed and food. Ensuring availability of quality seed in adequate quantity though imperative, yet, itself is not enough to trigger the production if it is not coupled with achieving sufficient varietal diversity in seed chain preferably phasing out gradually the old and obsolete varieties and inducting recently developed high yielding and disease resistant varieties. The overall progress and outcome are largely dependent on Government policies and support, which require consistent and adequate financial resources for sustaining a vibrant seed production, farm power machinery, processing units, storage, seed testing, delivery systems and trained human resources besides remunerative prices to the farmers. © 2020 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

AB  - Growing inequity in access to sustainable irrigation supply services, groundwater and electricity in particular, has become core agendas in many recent global development dialogues on account of food/nutritional security, ensuring on-farm livelihood opportunities, rural poverty alleviation and development. Herein, we aim to present a nation-wide appraisal of eco-environmental and socioeconomic ramifications of subsidizing farm-power services in India, to highlight future requirements to conserve groundwater reserves so as to ensure sustainable irrigation supply services. We adopted a mixed method approach, coupling secondary data analysis (obtained from various governmental archives), with a systematic review of relevant global literature. For the latter, we adopted a multi-stage PRISMA method (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) to summarize observations from post-2000 literature. Our results indicate that, over the years, groundwater has emerged as the mainstay of the irrigation sector in India (via millions of tube/bore wells), replacing surface-water systems (canals). However, unsustainable groundwater drafting has led to (i) significant groundwater drawdowns in most Indian states; (ii) exacerbated greenhouse gas emissions; and (iii) caused extensive soil-water salinization, which impede sustainable agrarian/rural development on long-run. Current literature, however, suggests that, unsustainable groundwater drafting is indulged at policy level only by (i) relaxed groundwater tariffing scheme, and (ii) lucrative agro-power subsidies – collectively which offer the farmers free reign to draft groundwater at will. We reflect on the rise of groundwater market, leading to disproportionate access to groundwater for irrigation, and tragedy of the less-endowed sections of the famring communities. We urge the concerned authorities to devise and implement strategic institutional reforms to bolster the agro-power subsidy delivery mechanisms, and reflect on opportunities of nationwide adoption of feeder channel segregation (FCS) and initiate minimum energy support (MES) schemes. The idea is to make the agro-energy sector more efficient (based on notions of equity, fairness and transparency for all to access the benefits. In the final section we urge the authorities to adopt a systems' thinking approach to identify the key barriers to on-ground implementation of FCS and MES; introduce smart metering system, and above all, incorporate the water-food-energy nexus application in mainstream decision making for irrigation services. The idea is to identify/develop means of resource co-management, identify synergies and trade-off, within a unified framework of irrigation systems’ governance that balances resources supply and demand, without endangering the ecosystem services. We also outline potential research directions; emphasize on need of targeted, process-level investigations with increased case studies, and urge the authorities for improved data dissemination and accessibility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Even if the will to follow a sustainable lifestyle in the Western countries is increasing, many developing countries are experiencing their phase of economic growth, threatening and overexploiting their environment. This study compares the Living Planet Index and the Human Development Index, and suggests that societies follow common patterns of development, from the indigenous lifestyle to undeveloped society, through a developing stage, towards a developed state. According to these common steps each society exploits local, regional and sometimes global natural resources to nourish its economic growth. If developing countries will not undertake strategies to skip the ‘intermediate’ stage of overexploitation of natural resources during their growing phase, Earth systems may not be able to keep alive the global biodiversity, and provide ecosystem services that sustain humanity. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Large-scale corporate projects, particularly those in extractive industries or hydropower development, have a history from early in the twentieth century of creating negative environmental, social, and health impacts on communities proximal to their operations. In many instances, especially for hydropower projects, the forced resettlement of entire communities was a feature in which local cultures and core human rights were severely impacted. These projects triggered an activist opposition that progressively expanded and became influential at both the host community level and with multilateral financial institutions. In parallel to, and spurred by, this activism, a shift occurred in 1969 with the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act in the United States, which required Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for certain types of industrial and infrastructure projects. Over the last four decades, there has been a global movement to develop a formal legal/regulatory EIA process for large industrial and infrastructure projects. In addition, social, health, and human rights impact assessments, with associated mitigation plans, were sequentially initiated and have increasingly influenced project design and relations among companies, host governments, and locally impacted communities. Often, beneficial community-level social, economic, and health programs have voluntarily been put in place by companies. These flagship programs can serve as benchmarks for community-corporate-government partnerships in the future. Here, we present examples of such positive phenomena and also focus attention on a myriad of challenges that still lie ahead. © 2016, National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adaptation and resilience are concepts meant to galvanize thinking around the ways and means of ensuring that cities, while standing their ground, develop a capacity to change for the greater good. Political crises across North Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine illustrate how events remote in physical space have impacts that touch everyone around the world: disrupted supply chains, rising prices, food insecurity and the mass movement of people highlight the importance of bringing complex systems thinking, integrated resource management practice and collective action processes to bear even in discrete contexts such as meeting the challenges of urban water security. The evidence in this collection shows highly uneven outcomes in pursuit of urban water security. The chapter authors argue for deeper commitment from all stakeholders toward improved governance through inclusive, transparent and accountable decision processes and practices; green design leading to the use of appropriate and affordable technology; concentrated focus on nature-based solutions that can be jointly undertaken by all stakeholders in order to not only build sustainably but to also build trust and social capital; fairness in pricing and the use of market forces; and specific, targeted actions framed by complex and integrated systems analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - We examine the dynamic affective responses along the cross-Atlantic coal supply chain from Colombia to Poland in the context of changing conditions triggered by the war in Ukraine following Russia's invasion in February 2022. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and a review of press releases and documents, our analysis focuses on the affects, emotions, social relations, and tensions resulting from people's everyday interactions with coal. We explore how unexpected events altered these interactions and how affective responses can shed light on the dynamic processes involved in the energy transition from coal. We argue that the transition is a non-linear process characterized by the diverse ways in which actors along coal supply chains experience, conceptualize, and represent it. In the context of these shifting dynamics, coal emerges as an ambiguous resource, viewed both as an outdated and polluting energy source that dispossesses Indigenous people and contributes to global warming and as a familiar and reliable fuel that provides a sense of security, maintains social relations, and remains an integral component of the global energy matrix. We conclude that a just energy transition from coal requires accounting for its complexity along supply chains, acknowledging the affective dimension of processes of change and continuity, and understanding the power dynamics between corporate agents, the state, and communities at extraction and consumption sites. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Fisheries are coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) across distant places, yet fisheries research has generally focused on better understanding either fisheries ecology or human dimensions in a specific place, rather than their interactions over distances. As economic and ideational globalization accelerate, fisheries are becoming more globally connected via movements of fish products and fisheries finances, information, and stakeholders throughout the world. As such, there is a pressing need for systematic approaches to assess these linkages among global fisheries, their effects on ecosystems and food security, and their implications for fisheries science and sustainability. Use of the telecoupling framework is a novel and insightful method to systematically evaluate socioeconomic and environmental interactions among CHANS. We apply the telecoupling framework to the Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) fishery, the world’s largest single-species commercial fishery and a complex CHANS. The anchoveta fishery has diverse and significant telecouplings, socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances, with the rest of the world, including fishmeal and fish oil trade, monetary flow, knowledge transfer, and movement of people. The use of the telecoupling framework reveals complex fishery dynamics such as feedbacks (e.g., profit maximization causing fishery overcapitalization) and surprises (e.g., stock collapse) resulting from local and long-distance ecological and socioeconomic interactions. The Peruvian anchoveta fishery illustrates how the telecoupling framework can be used to systematically assess the magnitude and diversity of local and distant fisheries interactions and thereby advance knowledge derived from traditional monothematic research approaches. Insights from the telecoupling framework provide a foundation from which to develop sustainable fisheries policy and management strategies across local, national, and international levels in a globalized world. © 2018 by the author(s).

AB  - The WTO Agreement on Agriculture was designed to maximize trade flows at a time of surplus agricultural production. It required Members to open markets and to reduce domestic and export subsidies. Proposals for reform in the Doha Round negotiations largely adopt the same pattern. Yet, as surplus is replaced by shortage, Members are increasingly concerned about food security and the impact of agriculture on climate change. And contemporary agricultural policies crystallize around 'sustainable intensification', where domestic production is promoted, but not at the expense of future production. This article suggests that, although both the Agreement on Agriculture and the Doha Round proposals do provide some scope for measures to address this new policy paradigm, there are instances where they may work actively against it. © 2013 British Institute of International and Comparative Law.

AB  - This article analyzes the development and organization of the United Nations Food Systems Summit (UNFSS), which is being convened by UN Secretary General António Guterres in late 2021. Although few people will dispute that global food systems need transformation, it has become clear that the Summit is instead an effort by a powerful alliance of multinational corporations, philanthropies, and export-oriented countries to subvert multilateral institutions of food governance and capture the global narrative of “food systems transformation.” This article places the upcoming Summit in the context of previous world food summits and analyzes concerns that have been voiced by many within civil society. It elaborates how the current structure and forms of participant recruitment and public engagement lack basic transparency and accountability, fail to address significant conflicts of interest, and ignore human rights. As the COVID-19 pandemic illuminates the structural vulnerabilities of the neoliberal model of food systems and the consequences of climate change for food production, a high-level commitment to equitable and sustainable food systems is needed now more than ever. However, the authors suggest that the UNFSS instead seems to follow a trajectory in which efforts to govern global food systems in the public interest has been subverted to maintain colonial and corporate forms of control. © Copyright © 2021 Canfield, Anderson and McMichael.

AB  - Background: In a restricted sense, the resource curse is a theory that explains the inverse relationship classically seen between dependence on natural resources and economic growth. It defines a peculiar economic and political environment, epitomised by oil extraction in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Based on secondary research and illustrations from four oil-rich geographical areas (the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, Angola, southern Chad, Southern Sudan), I propose a framework for analysing the effects of the resource curse on the structure of health systems at sub-national levels. Qualitative attributes are emphasised. The role of the corporate sector, the influence of conflicts, and the value of classical mitigation measures (such as health impact assessments) are further examined. Results: Health systems in a resource curse environment are classically fractured into tripartite components, including governmental health agencies, non-profit non-governmental organisations, and the corporate extractive sector. The three components entertain a range of contractual relationships generally based on operational considerations which are withdrawn from social or community values. Characterisation of agencies in this system should also include: values, operating principles, legitimacy and operational spaces. From this approach, it appears that community health is at the same time marginalised and instrumentalised toward economic and corporate interests in resource curse settings. Conclusion: From a public health point of view, the resource curse represents a fundamental failure of dominant development theories, rather than a delay in creating the proper economy and governance environment for social progress. The scope of research on the resource curse should be broadened to include more accurate or comprehensive indicators of destitution (including health components) and more open perspectives on causal mechanisms. © 2008 Calain; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to examine whether energy poverty impacts gender inequality and CO2 emissions in African countries with the biggest economies by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita from 1996 to 2020. Additionally, this study examines the existence of the gender Kuznets curve (GKC) and the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theories. Furthermore, it evaluates the connection between economic development and carbon emissions, on the one hand, and economic development and gender inequality on the other. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the augmented Dickey–Fuller and Phillip–Perron unit root tests to determine the degree of integration between the variables. It also uses the Pedroni and Fisher–Combine Johansen cointegration tests to assess a long-run relationship between the variables. The authors adopted the pooled mean group (PMG)-autoregressive distributed lag model and used the E-Views 12 software to run the analysis. Findings: The empirical analysis approves the long-run correlation among the variables used in this study. Increased energy poverty and GDP increase CO2 emissions, whereas income square hurts CO2 emissions. These results are consistent with the EKC hypothesis, which proposes a non-linear relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in the studied areas (similar to an inverted U shape). Long-term foreign direct investment (FDI) has a negative correlation with CO2 emissions. On the contrary, energy poverty, GDPsq and FDI find a positive relationship with gender inequality, whereas GDP finds a negative association with gender inequality. The negative relationship between GDPsq and gender inequality establishes a “U”-shaped connection between income and gender inequality. Thus, it supports the hypothesis of the GKC. Therefore, this study proposes that decreasing energy poverty is vital for promoting a clean environment and mitigating gender inequality. Originality/value: This study supports the hypothesis of the GKC. Therefore, this study proposes that decreasing energy poverty is vital for promoting a clean environment and mitigating gender inequality. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Global climate change threatens world food security. This research raises the issues of priority agricultural development, increasing agricultural production, and expanding the insurance coverage of the industry. The authors propose to implement insurance activities further to prevent the effects of climate change and economic support in the emphasizfd advancfment of food production in agriculture. The research relies on direct comparative analysis, statistical and economic analysis, and monographic observational data. To conduct deep research, the authors apply analysis and synthesis. The authors also use the questionnaire methods across the country and organization, monographic research, and other methods. Furthermore, the authors used international normative documents, research of scientists in scientific periodicals, and data from official websites. The authors conclude that to protect agricultural insurance and ensure the continuous development of agriculture, it is advisable to transition from administrative methods to the following recommendations for insurance against various financial and natural losses that may arise in agriculture due to the vagaries of nature. It is also recommended to introduce a mechanism of state subsidies to compensate for the costs and improve the efficiency of insurance agents in the insurance activities of agricultural enterprises. © 2024 Aktam U.

AB  - Cooperatives and socially responsible corporations are being hailed as possible correctives to the socioeconomic and ecological exploitation of transnational capitalism. AmazonCoopg a cooperative linking indigenous Brazil nut harvesters and the multinational firm The Body Shop through trade and development projectsg capitalized on indigenous symbolism to generate significant material benefits for both parties. At the same time, however, it made indigenous people more vulnerable and dependent, failed to promote participatory development, masked the effects of unfavorable state policies, and perpetuated discriminatory distinctions among indigenous people. Furthermore, the cooperative did not provide an organizational framework to ameliorate the vulnerabilities of indigenous identity politics or transform symbolic capital into enduring political-economic change. This case strongly supports arguments that cooperatives must be rooted in participation, democratic member control, and autonomy if they are to promote "fair globalization" or social transformation rather than institutionalize existing patterns of exploitation. © 2010 Latin American Perspectives.

AB  - In the face of challenges presented by climate change and rising social inequality on a global scale, scholars have criticised prevalent individualistic, economistic and materialistic definitions of well-being. In this context, Buen Vivir emerged as an alternative concept from Latin America, critically engaging with growth-centred development and current definitions of well-being. Buen Vivir promotes an alternative vision of well-being that relies on social practices, inter-personal relationships and an intact natural environment. The article argues to take up this inspiration and stresses the importance of a new conceptualisation of well-being. Thus, it presents the Index of Good Living (IGL) as an eudaimonic approach to measure well-being, resting on the concept of relational goods. The index uses time spent by individuals for certain activities as its main indicator, proposing a nuanced toolset to compare time-based inequalities in relation to well-being in different contexts. The paper discusses the theoretical and methodological aspects behind this approach and contextualises them with first empirical evidence from Ecuador and Germany. It illuminates strengths and potential openings for further refinement and indicates areas for transformative change–both in politics and in everyday life. © 2021 Global South Ltd.

The industry is not yet close to sustainability.The main driver for improvement is regulation rather than market measures. Some tourism advocates still use political approaches to avoid environmental restrictions, and to gain access to public natural resources.Future research priorities include: the role of tourism in expansion of protected areas; improvement in environmental accounting techniques; and the effects of individual perceptions of responsibility in addressing climate change. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Problems of industrial development are central in studying of foreign and domestic scientists. The definition of "economic human", its various modifications and capital were the central element of majority of economical researches. The quality of the environment, the limitations and availability of natural resources were under the interest in the context of: supply and demand balance of production factors; establishment of land rents size; reducing production costs. The aim of the article is to formalize the causal links between industrial development and environmental crises and investigate the mechanisms of interaction between main components of economic and ecological systems for development appropriate mathematical economic models. Industrial economical development is conducted by two environmentally destructive processes: substances and non-renewable energy resources extraction from natural cycle and environmental pollution emissions. The intensity of environmentally destructive cycle was quite small and environmental consequences of industrial development were ignored on the first steps of industrial development. Technological progress with infinity of human needs continuously expanded amounts and types of natural resources involved in anthropogenic circulation. All of these have created a variety of negative effects produced by industry. Eco-destructive cycle reached global scale on this stage of industrial development. The accumulation of imbalances of ecological system destabilizes the economic system due to loosing basis of economic development: (1) "earth"/natural capital as result of degradation and depletion of ecosystems, (2) "work'/human capital due to reducing population capacity that connected with the quality of life decreasing; (3) financial capital by increasing costs conned with decreasing the amount of available natural resources essential quality, increasing production costs, health protection, necessarily to reverse the effects of interrelated cycles of natural and man-made disasters. Studying of causal links between industrial production development and environmental crisis has allowed developing of cognitive map "environmentally destructive cycle". This map includes diagram of reinforcing loop of natural and man-made environmental disasters. According to this, it is logical to make a conclusion that the environmental crisis is an objective factor of thwart progress of economic growth in long-term. Considering of this fact justifies necessity to develop and implement a set of market and administrative stimulus for industrial development greening.

AB  - Deregulatory advocates often frame environmental protection and economic well-being as a zero-sum tradeoff. During times of economic crisis, including the long-term fallout from the global Covid-19 pandemic, policymakers may seek to withdraw or roll back environmental laws and regulations in an attempt to accelerate economic recovery. In order to safeguard the interests of vulnerable populations that suffer from pollution and other environmental harms, it is imperative to retain environmental regulations, removing or relaxing them only when there is a clear justification for doing so. Built into environmental legal frameworks in both international and domestic law is a principle of non-regression-no walking back environmental law, regulation, or protection once put in place. Governments and institutions at all levels ought to apply this principle in designing and implementing environmental governance, and judges, in their role of interpreting and applying the law, ought to incorporate the principle in their decisions and ensure the progressive realization of rights guaranteed by environmental law. This Article brings together a variety of expressions of the principle of non-regression in international treaties, trade agreements, declarations, and in domestic constitutions, statutes, and administrative law-within and outside the United States. Greater recognition of how this principle has worked in practice may be helpful in promoting the notion that, so long as environmental degradation continues to occur and threaten human well-being, environmental standards must continue to move forward and never look back. © 2022 University of Pennsylvania Law School.

AB  - The current neoclassical macroeconomic paradigm is fundamentally undermining the life support systems of the planet. This paper outlines a new macroeconomic paradigm, Earth Economics, that addresses these challenges by building an economic theory out of an ontology and ethics based on the modern scientific synthesis. Key concepts include scale that fits in the planet, just wealth distribution across all life, resilience over efficiency, and reciprocity. The key ethical premises are membership in the commonwealth of life, householding, and entropic thrift. A way forward for the discipline of economics and society as a whole is also articulated. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this chapter, the author briefly condenses the motives behind the increasing criticism of the intense quest for economic growth and discusses substantial proposals that argue for different approaches to growth. This overview of the current state of the art creates the foundation for main argument: the critical debates referring to the paradigm of quantitative growth usually blank out a crucial dimension: economic growth as social relations is linked to societal domination and, hence, to reproducing social structures. Societal domination, the author argue, in the tradition of the "older" Frankfurt School, is also the basis for domination-formed societal nature relations and should be considered as a main driver of current socio-ecological problems and a major obstacle for alternative approaches. The author shows that the growth critical debate in principle overlooks issues of power and domination, which is intrinsically linked to the societal structures and processes of capitalist growth. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Stefan Gaarsmand Jacobsen; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - The article discusses the possibilities of improving the manageability of agricultural production through the rational use of available land and other agricultural resources, which will increase the environmental friendliness and sustainability of agriculture in the long term. At the same time, state regulation measures should be aimed at increasing the efficiency of the rural economy, improving the quality of life of the rural population, preserving the environment, in particular soil fertility for future generations. The problem of the sustainable development and environmental friendliness of the agricultural sector are analyzed; the need to improve the state socio-economic policy and modern agrarian legislation is emphasized; the problems of ensuring the sustainability of agriculture at the state and regional levels are highlighted; the need to create an effective model for the use of natural resources in order to form sustainable relationships within the national economy; ensuring economic and food security of the country. © 2024 EDP Sciences.

AB  - Water scarcity and poor quality are major challenges in agriculture, affecting crop growth and food security. IoT and AI techniques are being explored for sustainable development, including water management, precision irrigation, and data analytics. IoT sensors collect real-time data, while AI algorithms predict availability and optimize irrigation schedules. Precision irrigation improves water use efficiency and productivity by utilizing data analytics and clustering algorithms. IoT and AI in agriculture offer economic benefits like increased crop yields, water savings, and sustainable practices. However, initial investment costs, social acceptance, and policy considerations hinder widespread adoption. Future directions should focus on scaling, collaboration, investment, customizable solutions, farmer-to-farmer knowledge transfer, and research funding. Addressing data privacy, security, and connectivity concerns is crucial for trust and confidence among stakeholders. © 2023, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - The trade in soybean, an important animal feed product, exemplifies the environmental and socio-economic impact of global markets and global agricultural policy. This paper analyses the impact of increasing production of soybean in the exporting countries (deforestation and grassland conversion) as well as in importing regions (decrease in permanent grassland by substitution of grass as feed). Ecosystem services monetary values were used to calculate the environmental and socio-economic impact of observed land use changes. This is balanced against the economic value of the global soybean trade. The results prove that consumption choices in one region have real effects on the supply of ecosystem services at a large spatial scale. Conclusively, solutions to make this global market more sustainable are discussed. © 2016 Boerema et al.

AB  - There is no denying the close linkage between ecosystem services and human well-being. Human well-being is dependent on the sustainable management of ecosystem services. With economic globalization and free trade, there is an increasing demand for these services. Yet, poverty, inefficient management of common resources, and inadequate legal and governance frameworks have a negative impact on human well-being. This article examines the impact of globalization as well as the legal mechanisms for the management of ecosystem services arguing that the need for a concerted and synergistic legal approach to manage ecosystem services in a sustainable manner that includes human rights principles alongside market-based instruments. © 2009 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.

AB  - Water markets are increasingly being relied upon as an instrument to reallocate water between competing users under conditions of water scarcity, and within an environment of fully committed water resources. Without such a reallocation new irrigation developments cannot take place and economic developments will be forgone to the detriment of rural communities. There is therefore a need for continued development of a water market mechanism to ensure that this reallocation process can take place as efficiently as possible, and to alleviate the socio-economic impact of water scarcity. Since markets are still emerging around the world it is important to learn from operating markets. This paper discusses the operational mechanism of a water exchange in Victoria, Australia, and analyses the outcome of the first five years of operation.

AB  - Rising social inequalities, environmental degradation and climate change are increasingly acknowledged as major threats to the long-term prosperity of modern economies. Significant attention has thus been placed on sustainability transitions in European policymaking to drive change towards a more inclusive and environmentally sustainable socio-economic system. Alongside these policy initiatives and frameworks, there has also been a rise in European tools for monitoring and measuring progress in different domains. The objective of this paper is to analyse the sustainability transition at the regional level in Europe based on a theoretical framework which links the main pillars of the sustainable development paradigm (in line with the 2030 agenda) with those of the human development paradigm. Using a dataset constructed at the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS)2 level for 2010–2019, the Sustainable Development and Human Development Index (SDHD) is developed and a spatial and econometric analysis is applied to identify spatio-temporal trends, clustering and the main determinants and spatial spillovers among the index dimensions. This contributes to the relative gap in studies covering multiple domains of sustainability across all European regions. Results highlight strong regional inequalities in both the SDHD and four domains across Europe, with a noticeable core–periphery divide. There is evidence of convergence across the EU-27, with Eastern European regions scoring the lowest but improving the most. From a spatial fixed-effects regression model, we find significant spatial dependence among neighbouring regions and that gender gaps in the labour market, teenage fertility rates and low educational attainment are significant negative determinants of SDHD. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - International trade of agricultural goods impacts local water scarcity. By quantifying the effect of trade on crop production on grid-cell level and combining it with cell- and crop-specific virtual water contents, we are able to determine green and blue water consumption and savings. Connecting the information on trade-related blue water usage to water shadow prices gives us the possibility to value the impact of international food crop trade on local blue water resources. To determine the trade-related value of the blue water usage, we employ two models: first, an economic land- and water-use model, simulating agricultural trade, production and water-shadow prices and second, a global vegetation and agricultural model, modeling the blue and green virtual water content of the traded crops. Our study found that globally, the international trade of food crops saves blue water worth 2.4. billion US$. This net saving occurs despite the fact that Europe exports virtual blue water in food crops worth 3.1 billion US$. Countries in the Middle East and South Asia profit from trade by importing water intensive crops, countries in Southern Europe on the other hand export water intensive agricultural goods from water scarce sites, deteriorating local water scarcity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fishery resource economics as a part of natural resource/environmental economics on the one hand and aquaculture economics (farm management economics) on the other has emerged as an important branch of applied economic research during the 1980s and 1990s in India, although research efforts were initiated earlier in the West. The declining productivity of the marine and inland capture fisheries, has attracted economists to analyse the institutional aspects facilitating research in marine resource economics. Uncontrolled access to fishery resources will result in greater than optimal level of fishing effort using a catch function representing bioeconomic equilibrium considering fishing effort, catch and fish population. Clark (1985) and Anderson (1986) developed the fishery dynamic model to incorporate changes over time and space. In India, researchers worked on empirical analysis of Indian marine resources and the socio-economic impact of management regulations. The researchers have developed the multi-species fisheries management plan and by measuring the externalities of coastal aquaculture developed an integrated land use plan incorporating shrimp farming. Kumar (2004) estimated price, income and supply elasticities for disaggregated individual fish groups. The author found that the income, price and supply elasticities vary substantially across fish species and it is wrong to group them together in any policy analysis. Further in a unique exercise by using a comprehensive Asia multi- market fish model the author estimated the socio-economic impact of changes in technology, trade and policies on the producers of various categories, exporters and consumers under alternative scenarios. It is important for researchers to look into these scenarios and how the individual fishery sectors in a given region will be impacted due to policy changes.

AB  - This is a comprehensive exploration of the diverse challenges and solutions related to environmentalism and sustainability. It bridges the gaps between theory and practice, offering practical insights for academics, policymakers, and change agents. It also inspires informed action and collaborative efforts for creating a sustainable future, offering new knowledge to those who care deeply about the planet and humanity's future. The book begins with the evolution of environmentalism; tracing how ecological awareness has shaped global movements and policies. It also delves into theories of sustainability, demonstrating their relevance in addressing contemporary environmental crises. Central to the discussion is the concept of resource inequality, revealing how disproportionate resource access hinders global development and sustainability. It also explores the sustainable development goals (SDGs), presenting them as vital frameworks for policy and action, alongside climate change mitigation strategies like renewable energy, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. In the context of social equity and environmental justice, it addresses global disparities, underscoring the need for inclusive and fair solutions. Technological innovation is presented as a key driver for transforming economies into more sustainable models, including the circular economy and green finance. Furthermore, the book highlights behavioral change, mental health, and well-being as integral to advancing environmentalism. Corporate responsibility and global cooperation are examined for their roles in driving collective action, and the book emphasizes the importance of these stakeholders in addressing the environmental crisis. It also introduces the epistemology of the development economy, providing a fresh lens on sustainability that can inform both academic inquiry and practical applications. © 2025 River Publishers.

AB  - This editorial for the Special Issue entitled ‘Energy Decentralisation – Institutional Perspectives’ in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews contrasts and compares thirteen research and review articles submitted over the last year, each with a specific regional or thematic focus. The contributions examine decentralisation, its impacts and/or institutional preconditions in the United States, Sweden, UK, Denmark, South Africa, Germany, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Australia, and include three international thematic reviews. Embedding the findings from this work in the wider literature on decentralisation and inclusivity, we identify key findings and avenues for further research. Our review begins with an overview of how energy decentralisation is conceptualised in research and policy, identifying the logics used by proponents and opponents across the literature. We review the ways in which structural institutional settings have influenced the prevalence of narratives furthered by stakeholders with different interests and worldviews, resulting in radically different policy decisions, support frameworks and incentive structures at regional or national scales. Building on these findings, our concluding discussion reflects on the factors that influence social consensus on, and effective implementation of, ambitious and inclusive energy policy. The focus of this Special Issue has become yet more relevant as governments around the world are forced to marry multiple crises in fiscal spending decisions; where significant economic support packages need to buffer the socio-economic impacts of COVID19 in the short to medium term, and simultaneously facilitate investment in infrastructure, technology and competencies that will enable the decarbonisation of the economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As deeply interlinked challenges to water, energy, and food security appear poised to accelerate in the coming decades, interest has grown in landscape-based approaches to manage water-energy-food (W-E-F) nexus risks and trade-offs. Both engineered and "natural infrastructure" approaches are needed to increase productivity and resilience in W-E-F systems and to meet pressures of a growing global population and changing climate. However, to date little information exists about the use of nature-based solutions globally, the scale of present investment, funders' motives, or observed results. This paper uses data from a global survey of watershed investments to examine the state of investment in "natural infrastructure"-based solutions for water, which can also address nexus challenges. We find that at least US $1 billion (B) flowed to watershed investment programs tackling nexus risks and trade-offs in 2013. But attention is focused largely on agricultural impacts on water and driven mainly by water service providers and the public sector. Our preliminary findings suggest that potential funders may be unaware of, or constrained in their ability to implement, nature-based strategies to address nexus-related challenges, and that current investment likely does not match the scale of risk or dependency of our W-E-F systems on healthy landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Integrating economic efficiency and environmental sustainability indicators is essential for designing policies for a sustainable development. Given the growing pressure on water resources, efficient water use becomes an essential environmental criteria for formulating adjustment reforms. Despite the wide use of backward and forward linkages as well as direct and indirect resource (energy, water, etc.) uses based on environmentally extended input-output models for assessing the performance of economic sectors, the common practice of presenting different indicators separately obstructed a straightforward policy interpretation of results. To derive a composite indicator that allows to direct ranking of sectors, we combined therefore a direct and indirect water use intensities with backward and forward linkage indexes by using the multi-criteria analysis method-TOPSIS (Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution). The model was implemented to formulate sectoral transformation measures guided by sustainable growth objectives in Uzbekistan, Central Asia, which is a representative of an area with growing water scarcity. The results showed that the presently promoted crops under the state order system-cotton and wheat-and crop preferred by farmers- rice-are the least effective production options for reaching such a sustainable growth. It is argued therefore that unbiased support for all crops through adaption of the current state order system for cotton and wheat cultivation is needed to achieve a more diversified crop portfolio with an increased share of fruits and vegetables. A further development of agro-processing industries and livestock sector bears more potential for sustainable economic development than a further promotion of producing raw agricultural commodities. Investing in industrial sectors illustrated more potential than in agriculture related sectors when aiming at economic effectiveness and increased water use efficiency. It is concluded that, with a relevant sectoral transformation, Uzbekistan has high opportunities to cope with reduced water availability. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - In modern conditions of the existence of socio-economic systems, the urgent problem is the formation of sustainable development of regions. To study the formation of sustainable development, the authors took two components, such as food security of the region and environmental innovation, an orientation towards a green economy. A comparative analysis of the theoretical aspects of the formation of food security in the works of domestic and foreign scientists is carried out. A study of the Global Food Security Index for 113 countries is presented, using the methods of statistical analysis and analytical grouping, six leading countries in terms of food security are identified. The largest group, accounting for 22.12% of the total population, is made up of countries in the 71.12-78.21 range of the Food Security Index. The grouping of countries was carried out according to the parameter "Natural resources and sustainability", which showed that the largest group, consisting of 38 countries or 33.62%, is in the range of 44.0-49.9, only 10 countries fell within the borders with the minimum the level of natural resources and sustainability from 32.2 to 38.1. The analysis made it possible to compile a rating and note the presence of the greatest food security problems in African countries. It is concluded that the transition to environmentally friendly ways of running the economy leads to high productivity of natural resources. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - The EU and China are major importers of ‘forest-risk’ commodities and thus play a pivotal role in shaping the sustainability of those commodities supply chains. The EU recently introduced a regulation mandating due diligence by companies to ensure commodities are not sourced from recently deforested land. However, even if eventually successful in eliminating ‘imported’ deforestation to Europe, the regulation risks creating leakage to China and other markets. This possibility has prompted stakeholders to call for cooperation and policy alignment between the EU and China to address imported deforestation. This study applies the ‘Brussels Effect’ theory to identify what factors hinder or facilitate such policy convergence. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with key informants engaged in EU-China dialogues on the topic. Our findings suggest that, despite political signals from high-level Chinese leadership, it is unlikely that China will adopt trade measures requiring ‘deforestation free’ commodities in the foreseeable future. China's foreign policy stance of non-interference and concerns about its food security are key obstacles. While this limits the prospects of policy convergence in the short to medium term, a mix of market-based forces and cooperative mechanisms enabled by the EU regulation may lower the barriers and costs for companies to expand compliance with zero deforestation standards to other markets such as China, making some level of ‘de facto’ convergence plausible. We also note the importance of moving beyond a unilateral ‘Brussels Effect’ framing to consider the role of diplomacy, cooperation, and geopolitical conditions that promote, or run counter to, policy convergence. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Activists have exposed startling forms of labor exploitation and environmental degradation in global industries, leading many large retailers and brands to adopt standards for fairness and sustainability. This book is about the idea that transnational corporations can push these rules through their global supply chains, and in effect, pull factories, forests, and farms out of their local contexts and up to global best practices. For many scholars and practitioners, this kind of private regulation and global standard-setting can provide an alternative to regulation by territorially bound, gridlocked, or incapacitated nation states, potentially improving environments and working conditions around the world and protecting the rights of exploited workers, impoverished farmers, and marginalized communities. But can private, voluntary rules actually create meaningful forms of regulation? Are forests and factories around the world being made into sustainable ecosystems and decent workplaces? Can global norms remake local orders? This book provides striking new answers by comparing the private regulation of land and labor in democratic and authoritarian settings. Case studies of sustainable forestry and fair labor standards in Indonesia and China show not only how transnational standards are implemented “on the ground” but also how they are constrained and reconfigured by domestic governance. Combining rich multi-method analyses, a powerful comparative approach, and a new theory of private regulation, this book reveals the contours and contradictions of transnational governance. © Tim Bartley 2018.

AB  - This paper proposes a household model that relates various development interventions, such as infrastructure, to rural development. The model is then estimated using data from a household survey in which rural development outcomes are measured in terms of a perception scale. Household perceptions are important early lead indicators of rural development outcomes that manifest later. Rural poverty is linked to the exposure of the households to economic vulnerability, through their chronic dependence on agriculture for income generation. A starting point in mitigating this vulnerability would be a comprehensive improvement in accessibility. This would substantially reduce transportation cost and thereby lessen the isolation of rural communities from basic welfare services. An advocacy campaign and/or incentive system would be needed to encourage private firms to establish operations in rural areas. More private establishments in rural areas would not only shield households against exposure to vulnerability, but would also serve as a catalyst for microenterprise development. Sustainable rural development would follow, provided that there was an ample corporate social responsibility programme among these firms to avert a widening of inequality. A natural resource management strategy would also be needed for ecological integrity. Community participation is crucial in identifying development projects; it can help to minimise the wastage of resources on inappropriate projects, and enable resources to be allocated instead it to other productive uses. The provision of rural roads should be bundled properly with support services and capacity-building activities. This can enhance the demand for other infrastructure and services, resulting in a dynamic evolution of essential elements in the pursuit of rural development. Bundles of intervention improve the production efficiency of rural households at the different stages of production, both on and off the farm. Rural development interventions should pay special attention to the more vulnerable segments of the community, especially, the farmers. Interventions should aim gradually to detach them from complete dependence on agriculture, without putting their food security at risk. Public investments in infrastructure and in users' fees can complement each other, in the continuous provision of new infrastructure and the maintenance of existing infrastructure, to create a sustainable track towards rural development. The socialised users' fee system is a potential tool for preventing widening income disparity in rural areas. The careful selection of a suitable and acceptable basis for the socialised users' fee rate is important, however. An incorrect choice of rate could be perceived as a disincentive to access or might stimulate distrust among a segment of the rural society, regarding the government's sincerity in promoting rural development. This might eventually create more social issues, rather than bridging inequality. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Full-scale technical potential provides a clear horizon for agricultural technology policy to meet the dual and urgent challenge of meeting food security and minimising the effects of climate change. A common stated goal is to double food production by 2050 to meet the needs of 9 billion people. The frontier of full-scale technical potential embodies this goal and provides a panacea for policy makers. However, the pathway between the present adoption of technologies towards this frontier is paved with some hazards which may be insurmountable. We develop a conceptual framework based on adoption levels of technology. The key criteria between current and potential adoption of technologies is the role of enablers, that is interventions which create changes in structural, distributional, technical, social and behavioural cultures. Policy must find optimal mixtures of regulation and voluntary mechanisms to fully encourage uptake of technologies and shift current adoption to meet full-scale technical potential. A range of technologies can be aligned with sustainable intensification and are examined in terms of this enabler framework. Further examination of the framework allows us to conclude that full-scale technical potential will never be achieved due to the stochastic nature of agricultural production, the diversity of motivations and institutional structures operating within food supply chains, as well as unbalanced cost-effectiveness criteria. We argue that sustainable intensification may provide a direction of travel for attaining food security but its poor conception, limited acceptability and understanding amongst the communities of interest lead to over-optimism in determining the journey to this final destination. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - The recent progress in the study of climate change impacts and responses signifies the value of integrating adaptation and mitigation. Now, the focus is not limited to the responses of climate change, rather shifting to linking the climate change responses to sustainable development for overarching the human well-being. Integration of mitigation and adaptation responses can generate mutual tangible and intangible benefits and co-benefits with sustainable development. This integration would facilitate to the UN General Assembly the 2030 development agenda titled ‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ through 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). These goals are incapacitated by a number of daunting problems such as inequality, conflicts, rapid urbanization, persistent pockets of poverty and hunger. Climate change is one of the major stressors challenging the competency to attain the ecological, economic and social objectives that outline the SDGs. Climate change, as a major stressor, is responsible for impacting directly and indirectly the multiple stressors such as food security, migration, biodiversity. Low carbon growth, resource efficiency and social inclusivity are paramount to sustainable development, and mitigation and adaptation to climate change may provide pathways to achieve the targets of SDGs. The holistic and integrated approach along with multidimensional and extensive research results can cast an informational basis for making decisions and choices targeting to achieve the sustainable development goals. Therefore, solution to climate change, that is, mitigation and adaptation, is pivotal for a sustainable future. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Energy poverty is a global challenge and the scarcity has been emerging as a global issue. Therefore, the relationship among energy scarcity, sustainable finance, and carbon emissions is analyzed with the help of global data from 40 developing countries until the beginning of the COVID-19 era. For empirical results’ estimation, the study analyzed a panel data ranging from 2000 to 2019. To measure the energy poverty, some part of population that has no access to energy is considered, and empirical analysis based on augmented mean group (AMG) regression method was carried out. The findings of the study suggest the inverse relation among energy poverty and carbon emissions. Moreover, a negative relationship was also observed between sustainable finance and carbon emissions. These findings highlight that alleviation of energy poverty can intensify environmental pollution. While improvement in access to clean energy will benefit society by alleviating energy poverty and controlling carbon emissions. Moreover, improvement in the share of sustainable finance in total investment may improve the environment quality by reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, it is suggested that regional plans along with sustainable finance are required on a priority basis for the promotion of clean energy to control carbon emissions and alleviate energy poverty at the household level. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The concept of a ‘just transition’ to a low-carbon economy is firmly embedded in mainstream global discourses about mitigating climate change. Drawing on Karl Polanyi's political economy elaborated in The Great Transformation, we interrogate the idea of a just transition and place it within its historical context. We address a major contradiction at the core of global energy transition debates: the rapid shift to low-carbon energy-systems will require increased extraction of minerals and metals. In doing so, we argue that extractive industries are energy and carbon-intensive, and will enlarge and intensify social and ecological injustice. Our findings reveal the importance of understanding how the idea of a just transition is used, and by who, and the type of justice that underpins this concept. We demonstrate the need to ground just transition policies and programmes in a notion of justice as fairness. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Emission regulations provide a fundamental framework for improving environmental quality, protecting public health, and addressing the global issue of climate change. Environmental regulations directly and indirectly affect industries, create incentives for technological innovation, and promote sustainable development. These are implemented as government policies aimed at reducing the adverse impacts of anthropogenic activities on the environment. Environmental policies are designed to control and manage emissions, promote natural resource conservation, and encourage sustainable practices across economic sectors. There is a voluminous literature on climate change and climate change policies, spanning across many disciplines of scholarship including economics, climatology, chemistry, political science, engineering, and more. This entry is focused only on providing a very general overview of the types of economic policy approaches that have been considered in an effort to deal with climate change. © Michael D. Noel 2024.

AB  - Purpose: This study provides the critical masses (thresholds) at which the positive incidence of finance and economic growth will be dampened by the negative effects of income inequality and poverty on energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa for policy direction. Design/methodology/approach: The study employed the two steps systems GMM estimator for 41 countries in Africa from 2005–2020. Findings: The study found that for finance to maintain a positive effect on energy consumption per capita, the critical thresholds for the income inequality indicators (Atkinson coefficient, Gini index and the Palma ratio) should not exceed 0.681, 0.582 and 5.991, respectively. Similarly, for economic growth (GDP per capita growth) to maintain a positive effect on energy consumption per capita, the critical thresholds for the income inequality indicators (Atkinson coefficient, Gini index and the Palma ratio) should not exceed 0.669, 0.568 and 6.110, respectively. On the poverty level in Sub-Saharan Africa, the study reports that the poverty headcount ratios (hc$144ppp2011, hc$186ppp2011 and hc$250ppp2005) should not exceed 7.342, 28.278 and 129.332, respectively for financial development to maintain a positive effect on energy consumption per capita. The study also confirms the positive nexus between access to finance (financial development) and energy consumption per capita, with the attending adverse effect on CO2 emissions inescapable. The findings of this study make it evidently clear, for policy recommendation that finance is at the micro-foundation of economic growth, income inequality and poverty alleviation. However, a maximum threshold of income inequality and poverty headcount ratios as indicated in this study must be maintained to attain the full positive ramifications of financial development and economic growth on energy consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa. Originality/value: The originality of this study is found in the computation of the threshold and net effects of poverty and income inequality in economic growth through the conditional and unconditional effects of finance. © 2022, Michael Asiedu, Nana Adwoa Anokye Effah and Emmanuel Mensah Aboagye.

AB  - Deltas are especially vulnerable to climate change given their low-lying location and exposure to storm surges, coastal and fluvial flooding, sea level rise and subsidence. Increases in such events and other circumstances are contributing to the change in the environmental conditions in the deltas, which translates into changes in the productivity of ecosystems and, ultimately, into impacts on livelihoods and human well-being. Accordingly, climate change will affect not only the biophysical conditions of deltaic environments but also their economic circumstances. Furthermore, these economic implications will spill over to other regions through goods and services supply chains and via migration. In this paper we take a wider view about some of the specific studies within this Special Issue. We analyse the extent to which the biophysical context of the deltas contributes to the sustainability of the different economic activities, in the deltas and in other regions. We construct a set of environmental-extended multiregional input-output databases and Social Accounting Matrices that are used to trace the flow of provisioning ecosystem services across the supply chains, providing a view of the links between the biophysical environment and the economic activities. We also integrate this information into a Computable General Equilibrium model to assess how the changes in the provision of natural resources due to climate change can potentially affect the economies of the deltas and linked regions, and how this in turn affects economic vulnerability and sustainability in these regions. © 2018

AB  - In this chapter, Seema Arora-Jonsson discusses the question of just transitions with a cross section of people working for a better climate in India: a former civil servant and climate negotiator who has long worked with climate issues, a practitioner/activist working on just transitions in an NGO, an activist with a long history in the women’s grassroots movements, a gender activist who has worked extensively with climate change at the international level as well as a networker who maintains a platform for corporations for climate finance. We discuss the context in which transitions are taking place, go on to current policy approaches and its gendered aspects and the structural challenges and barriers of policy approaches to a just transition. In the overarching gloom, we also discuss the rays of hope, and we end with what we believe is needed to take the world into a sustainable and climate-resilient place. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Seema Arora- Jonsson, Kavya Michael, and Manish Kumar Shrivastava; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Ecological footprints have made it possible to study the dependence on natural resources and the human impact derived from the substantial growth of the world population. Food security represents the sufficient and stable availability of food, with timely and stable access for future generations. Food security is an essential issue for agri-food systems that have been greatly affected by the demand for food, the current problems of sustainability, the high losses of food and waste generated in the production and supply chain, the limitations of natural resources and climate change. The circular economy still being a model of production and consumption under the reuse and recycling of materials for as long as possible to face the challenges of climate change, resource depletion and population growth. Currently, there is a need to adopt a political strategy of gradual transition and full integration of the different world entities from the different political sectors to achieve a sustainable and balanced food system with environmental, economic, and social sustainability. This review highlights the need to change the unsustainability of various in-practice agri-food systems and their interactions with the environment. Further, considering the Sustainable Development Goals of United Nations, insightful perspectives have been given to preserve and enhance sustain the agro-food systems and reduce the environmental impact for global sustainable food security. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Major socio-economic benefits provided by forests include the promotion of efficient production and processing of forest products, along with the associated reduction of volume of waste and its reuse. This study begins with the description of how socio-economic benefits are related to the welfare or well-being of the population and the indication that forests can be promoted in two main ways: the first is to generate industry earnings (production benefits), while the second is to bring consumption of forest products in accordance with basic human needs or in improving living conditions in a different way (consumer benefits). The remaining analysis is aimed at assessing some of these benefits from two perspectives: the amount of benefits received and the number of people receiving such benefits. The kinds of socio-economic benefits from using forests are generalized, which is based on information available from national censuses, largescale surveys and other sources providing a sufficient level of data reliability. In the case of kinds of the production benefits, the values provided in the table should be considered as an estimated minimum, which is due to the lack of information on a number of products and countries. Values for the consumer benefits are generally more reliable but limited in the kinds of benefits. In particular, despite showing how forests directly contribute to meeting basic needs, they do not include many of the less obvious kinds of benefits from using forests (e.g. environmental services) that can also help meet the indicated needs or otherwise enhance living conditions.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals specifically goals 6,7, 8, 12, 13, 14 and 15 aim to prevent environmental degradation, promote biodiversity, reduce carbon emissions, improve energy consumption, and preserve the ecosystem to support inclusive economic development. This paper sought to explore the nexus between financial development (FD), inclusive growth, and environmental quality (EQ) in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) for the 1990–2018 period. Further, this study reconceptualizes the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve into the Financial Development Environmental Kuznets Curve (FDEKC) that explains the finance-environment relationship in varied economic development strata (High human development index—HHDI, Medium human development—MHDI, Lower human development index—LHDI) using two proxies of EQ: ecological footprint and CO2 emissions. The panel corrected standard error estimator by Beck and Katz (Am Polit Sci Rev 89(3):634–647, 1995) was used to estimate the models. The results suggest that (1) there is a non-linear (inverted U-shaped) relationship between FD and EQ (defined by ecological footprint) in both the HHDI and MHDI economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, FD improves EQ in LHDI economies both at the initial stage of FD and long term. (2) The nexus between FD and EQ (defined by CO2 emissions) is U-shaped in HHDI economies, an inverted U-shaped in LHDI economies, and deteriorating in MHDI economies (3) Inclusive growth, as defined by a holistic index, has a deteriorating effect on EQ (CO2 emissions) across all groups. However, while inclusive growth is inimical to EQ (ecological footprint) in MHDI economies, it improves EQ in LHDI economies. This study concludes that EQ assessment requires a tailor-made strategy that considers each country's particulars, including its resources and economic situation. Further, SSA countries should ensure equitable distribution of the advantages of economic growth and augment FD to improve and EQ. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - Although Vietnam’s commitment to sustainability is quite evident due to its strategic adoption of sustainable practices, however, with significant economic expansion, the country has been facing significant environmental challenges in the form of deforestation, pollution, climate change and others. The scenario, thus, necessitates a multi-faceted approach to ensure long term sustainability. In this regard, the present study aims to assess green finance, environmental policy, green innovations, health expenditures, and human development in terms of sustainable development in the Vietnamese context. The study used time series data from 1995 to 2021 and analysed it through QARDL estimations. With significant results in the case of green finance, environmental policy, green innovations and health expenditures, the study suggests that environmental policies greatly help the country provide a regulatory framework that enforces green practices. Green innovation and green finance are also vital tools for the economy to drive economic growth by creating new sustainable paths and promoting funding for green projects. Findings also highlight the crucial role of effective health spending as it ensures that a healthier population is capable of participating in sustainable initiatives. Thus, this confirms the evident role of these synergetic factors in the country’s progress toward carbon neutrality. However, the insignificant relationship of human development with sustainable development can be an exciting debate, implying that sometimes careless policies aimed at carbon neutrality neglect socio-economic factors. Therefore, in light of the findings, the study recommends implementing strict environmental policies and promoting green innovation activities. It is also suggested that the policies of the health and education sector be revised to promote sustainability in Vietnam. © Vilnius University, 2002-2024 and Brno University of Technology, 2002-2024 and University of Latvia, 2002-2024.

AB  - Agriculture is the largest type of land use in the UK, accounting for about 77 per cent of the total area, compared with an average 50 per cent for the EU27. But in common with most high-income countries, agriculture's contribution to UK GDP and employment is low, at about 0.5 and 1.8 per cent, respectively, although the regional importance of the sector (and its associated food and farming industries) varies considerably. Of the 17.5 million ha used for agriculture, about 28 per cent is allocated to crops, and 67 per cent is grassland. The grassland includes 4.4 million ha of sole-owned rough grazing and 1.1 million ha of common land in mainly upland "disadvantaged areas," primarily used for beef and sheep production. This has a major influence on land use, especially in the northern and western parts of the UK. From the 1930s until the mid-1980s, UK policy promoted increases in agricultural productivity to feed the nation from its own resources. An array of income and production support measures encouraged intensive farming, including a relative switch to arable farming in eastern areas. Since the early-1990s, policies have sought simultaneously to make UK agriculture internationally competitive and environmentally benign. These policies, evident in the Agenda 2000 Reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, point the way forward for the future. It is likely that a greater distinction will emerge between policies to protect natural resources and enhance the flow of non-market ecosystem services from rural land, and agriculture and food policies intended to encourage an appropriate proportion of national food requirements to be met from domestic sources. It seems likely that over the next 50 years, the UK's land area will be required to deliver an increasingly diverse range of private and public goods to meet growing human needs and aspirations. This will require a balance of policy-driven goals and market forces. It will also need a much improved understanding of the trade-offs between food production and environmental goals and of the institutional arrangements required to achieve a balance of economic, social and environmental outcomes. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - The transition away from a fossil-fuel powered economy towards a cleaner production system will create winners and losers in the global trade system. We compile a list of ‘brown’ traded products whose use is highly likely to decline if the world is to mitigate climate change, and explore which countries are most at risk of seeing their productive capabilities ‘stranded’. Using methods from economic geography and complexity, we develop novel measures of transition risk that capture the extent to which countries’ export profiles are locked-in to brown products. We show that countries exporting a high number of brown products, especially technologically sophisticated ones, could find it relatively easy to transition. Conversely, countries with exports highly concentrated in a few, low-complexity brown products have much fewer nearby diversification opportunities. Our results suggest that export complexity and diversity play a key role in determining transition risk. Path-breaking diversification strategies are needed to prevent nations from becoming stranded. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd

AB  - Arguments in support of carbon border adjustment measures are often based on considerations of justice. Implementing carbon border adjustment measures would be necessary to, first, promote fair competition between corporations and, second, make carbon pricing instruments more effective and thus prevent the harms of dangerous climate change. Yet, both arguments tend to obscure considerations of distributive justice relative to the burdens of climate policies and the benefits of economic cooperation. In this article, we first explain why the case for carbon border adjustment measures based on the ideal of fair competition between corporations is flawed. Second, if the priority of harm avoidance over fair burden-sharing can justify carbon border adjustment measures, we argue that it does not justify all kinds of carbon border adjustment measures. On the contrary, it puts significant constraints on their design. We contend that just carbon border adjustment measures should include design features that allow for some form of carbon leakage risk, either via country-differentiated prices or via country-specific exemptions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Sustainable development is guided by three pillars: the economy, society and the environment. Social consequences on health are shaped by economic systems and social structures, which are integrated with the larger environment and affect the global allocation of energy resources. This is the first research of its kind to examine the social and economic effects of environmental degradation changes while considering cross-sectional dependency. This article examines the effect of natural resource management policies and socioeconomic development on Asia's ecological footprint from 1995 to 2020, considering natural resources, population growth and industrial development. Our research shows that changes in the natural resources and ecological footprint have improved economic conditions and social outcomes, including human progress and income distribution. Two different outcomes of recent natural resource management are improved operational efficiency and decreased environmental degradation. Our findings hold up even considering other possible model specifications considering the interaction impacts of power sector changes. The findings reveal a favourable correlation between ecological footprint and natural net financial accounts, natural resources and GDP growth. Long-term environmental sustainability is a byproduct of a flourishing society and economy. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Factors such as climate change, economic development, population growth, pandemics, and geopolitical instability threaten water, energy, and food (WEF) security, which consequently put sustainability at risk. However, studies that simultaneously consider WEF security and sustainability aspects still need improvement. This research aimed to build a sustainable WEF nexus framework and analyze the interrelationships among water consumption, electricity demand, food production, and ecological footprint, considering the Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and external factors of the WEF nexus. For the empirical analysis, this study employed the three-stage least squares method to identify synergies and trade-offs in the sustainable WEF nexus in South Korea using panel data from 2005 to 2019. The results indicated that rice production causes excessive use of agricultural water, thereby deteriorating water availability and quality. This phenomenon leads to scarce water resources and environmental degradation, which negatively impact energy production and sustainability. Although increased agricultural productivity through automation improves food security, it can pose a threat to energy security by increasing electricity demand and energy imports. The EKC hypothesis test revealed that environmental problems cannot be solved through economic development. However, the indicators related to WEF security influence environmental sustainability rather than economic growth. These results indicate that WEF security and sustainability can be improved simultaneously by maximizing synergies and minimizing trade-offs within a sustainable WEF nexus. Therefore, this research provides a roadmap for policymakers regarding efficient ways to improve environmental quality and WEF security. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Forests can help rural households cope with food insecurity challenges in the face of climate change while also sequestering carbon and advancing other sustainability objectives in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). As such, participation in the forestry sector can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially on hunger and food security (SDG 2) in forest rich, but economically poor areas of LMICs. However, analysis of the effects of forest sector participation on food security in such contexts remain limited. Here we estimate the effects of participation in forest-based activities like collection and processing of timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) on household food security in Liberia, the most forested country in West Africa. We applied endogenous switching poisson regression to data from 1408 households living in the proximity of forests included in Liberia’s 2019 national household forest survey to estimate the effect of forest sector participation on food security (in terms of reduction in the number of months households reportedly had insufficient food). Results show that forest-sector participation reduced the number of months households had insufficient food by 84% (about 2.7 months). Heterogeneity analyses show that NTFPs affected food security by 80% (about 2.5 months) compared to timber and wood products, which had a 66% effect size (about 2.1 months) on average. Our results provide new, national-scale evidence on the role of forests in enhancing food security in Liberia and suggest the importance of forest sector participation for food security and achieving SDG 2 more generally. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Addressing climate change presents specific challenges for the countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), particularly concerning oil production and water scarcity, but it also offers opportunities for new paths toward sustainability. The transition to low-carbon energy raises significant concerns for oil and gas producers in the MENA region, especially regarding their dependence on hydrocarbon revenues. Without proper adjustments, this transition could worsen macroeconomic imbalances and potentially threaten existing social contracts. Policymakers are working to promote various renewable energy sources and implementation strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. As a result, the development of an index capable of accurately measuring and benchmarking a country's overall sustainability and economic performance becomes essential. This index should provide a comprehensive assessment of both the current and future state of renewable energy. Additionally, it must highlight key environmental, social, governance (ESG), and economic factors within the renewable energy sector. This proposal aims to establish a composite index, referred to as the Renewable Energy Responsible Investment Index (RERII), covering 19 countries and utilizing 22 distinct metrics. The RERII trend is calculated from 2010 to 2019. The proposed index can serve as a screening tool, decision-making aid, benchmarking instrument, and guide for sustainable development. © 2024, Creative Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - Robotics technology transforms industries by driving sustainable development, improving healthcare delivery, decreasing inequality, and promoting economic growth. Through innovation and automation, robotics fosters inclusivity and efficiency, empowering underserved communities while tackling global challenges in line with the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs). Despite extensive research on robotics' impacts on sustainable development goals (SDGs), there is limited focus on how these technologies influence Healthcare, innovation, inequality, and economic growth, particularly in developing nations. This study uses a systematic literature review to enhance understanding of robotics as a catalyst for sustainable development. Findings show that SDGs' economic and Healthcare aspects are well-studied, representing 17% of the literature, with innovation at 18.9%, inequality at 9.4%, and SDG 8 at 3.8%. Other SDG aspects account for 34% of the research. The literature emphasizes the role of automation and robotics in achieving ecologically and economically aligned SDGs, particularly in sustainable Healthcare, where robotics can improve medication management in home care. However, many areas in robotics applications remain underexplored, indicating a need for further research to bridge existing gaps. There are untapped opportunities to leverage new tools to accelerate the achievement of global SDGs, particularly for deepening and expanding current efforts. SDG 8 remains under investigated. This study proposes a conceptual framework for sustainable technologies to advance SDG achievement. The findings underscore the critical role of robotics in advancing SDGs, especially in innovation and Healthcare, though highlighting gaps in economic growth and inequality research. Future research should focus on expanding robotics applications, particularly for underexplored areas such as SDG 8, to fully utilise their potential for sustainable development. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Cities in the USA are facing the impacts of climate change and socio-economic disparities on a daily basis. In response, local governments are leading other public and even private organisations on sustainability efforts in general and in sustainable procurement in particular. The research on what drives a local government's involvement in sustainable procurement is scarce. This study analyses survey responses from 207 US regional and local governments to create a model analysing organisational, regional socio-economic, and regional demographic variables and demonstrates that political leanings, degree of professionalisation, and access to decision makers are the most significant predictors of variance in adoption of sustainable procurement practices. We conclude that ethical spending of public dollars to achieve sustainable outcomes (i.e., sustainable procurement) is more likely to be influenced by the political leanings of the population than by the capacity of the local government to institute and enforce sustainable practices. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This book examines the current food security challenges in the small states with a focus on the Caribbean. The work is in the conjuncture of the Covid-19 pandemic and other global shocks, including the disruption in the global supply chains and the increase in climate-related events. These events have led to an increase in global prices, including the price of food and fertilisers. This book starts by examining the global food security crisis considering the aftereffects of the shocks, then provides a macro-overview of the region by focusing on its ability to invest in agriculture. The results indicate that private sector investment in agriculture has experienced only a slight increase despite creeping inflation. This has exacerbated vulnerabilities in food security, which deteriorated in 2020, undoing nearly a decade of progress in the face of climate change. Detailed attention is paid to food vulnerabilities in 14 Caribbean countries. In the final chapter, a series of policy measures are outlined to strengthen the region's food security position, with a particular focus on innovation and the region's comparative advantages. © 2025 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - With growing global concern for environmental protection, climate change and sustainable development, policymakers and researchers have recently focused on green finance. In this study, existing studies on green finance in the context of the banking sector have been reviewed with considerations on products and determinants of green finance. The content analysis approach has been used to critically analyse and summarize forty-six (46) relevant studies. The results found green securities, green investments, climate finance, carbon finance, green insurance, green credit and green infrastructural bonds as part of key green finance products of banks. Pertinent determinants the study found to be influencing green finance policies from banks include environmental and climate change policies, interest rates, religion, risks, social inclusion and social justice as well as banking regulations. In theory, this study provides a guide for further studies. The results of the study will assist banks on the key issues to consider in adopting, developing and granting green finance. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The study covered the period 1986–2018, while dynamic GMM was employed for the estimations. When poverty reduction was measured by household final consumption expenditure, it was found that the interaction between foreign direct investment and environmental degradation measures failed to contribute to poverty reduction. However, when poverty reduction was measured by the human development index, it was found that the interaction of foreign direct investment and environmental degradation enhanced poverty reduction. When poverty reduction was measured by life expectancy, the interaction term of FDI and carbon dioxide (CO2) was harmful to poverty reduction, while the interaction terms of FDI with other measures of environmental degradation had no effect on poverty reduction. The implications of the study were discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - A profound change of the global food and agriculture system is needed if we are to nourish today's 795 million hungry and the expected 2 billion people by 2050. Aside from hunger and malnutrition, food insecurity results in a wide range of problems such as health, environmental degradation, and a high rate of crime. When food security improves, most facets of life improve as well. While most Nigerians engaged in activities outside the agricultural sector, the country is in danger of being engulfed in a food crisis. Improving agriculture and food security (being able to produce enough food to sustain families and communities year after year), is a herculean task for the Omu-Aran community. There are no incentives for women to engage in commercial agriculture. Based on the above, this study tends to examine the role of women in proving food security and how this could help in the eradication of hunger in the Omu-Aran community in Kwara State. It argues that women have more restricted access than men to productive resources and opportunities including land, livestock, inputs, education, extension and research services, and financial services. Closing this gender gap would give an important boost to agricultural productivity and output, and in bringing agricultural yields similar to those of men, government at all levels, as well as corporate and financial establishments, must commit a large chunk of resources towards motivating women farmers. Role theory provides the theoretical framework for the study. The design for the study was both descriptive and exploratory. A two-stage sampling consisting of purposive and simple random techniques were used to select the respondents. The sample population comprises 35 food crop farming households in the Omu-Aran community. A structured interview was used to elicit information on the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. Twenty-five in-depth interviews were conducted. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively while qualitative data was content analyses. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Critical perspectives on economic growth have laid bare the fragility of the assumed link between material growth and socio-ecological wellbeing. The appeal of economic growth, however, goes beyond the economic sphere. As a societal goal, growth is often mobilized to pre-empt and/or co-opt opposition around issues of social justice and redistribution. Not only does the constitution of growth as a collective goal serve to unite the internally fragmented sphere of the social and brush aside (class-based) distributional conflicts, but it also enables the distribution of material concessions to subordinate classes for eliciting their consent. The degrowth proposal should thus more broadly tackle the material and discoursive ways in which growth enables the reproduction of contemporary political-economic systems. This paper argues that the notion of growth functions as a powerful ideal that shapes state–society relationships and social-collective imaginations. It demonstrates this by discussing the making of state in Turkey through a Gramscian perspective, where the notion of economic growth is deeply imprinted in the broader practices of the state to legitimize its existence and dominates the social imaginary in a way that cannot be easily dismissed. Against this backdrop, the possibility of not only effectuating, but also imagining and desiring degrowth would call for a radical reconfiguration of state–society relationships. Within this context, the Kurdish Freedom Movement’s project of Democratic Economy emerges as an alternative, both to the nation-state paradigm and to the imperative of economic growth. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - It is broadly recognised that vigorous agricultural growth is essential for African development, both in support of aggregate economic growth and a structural transformation of the economy towards industrialisation, and of poverty reduction and improved food security. For the first, this is because agriculture is a large sector, with important multiplier effects on other sectors of the economy, competitive advantage given the current state of institutional development, and is necessary to support internationally competitive labour costs for the rest of the economy due to incomplete tradability of food. For the second, this is because a vast majority of the poor are rural people who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, and access to food importantly depends on local production. Yet, this achievement has largely been elusive, with Africa still to achieve a Green Revolution as other continents have done. Fundamental questions are thus: Why this has been the case? How could a Green Revolution be engineered? And what are some of the emerging opportunities and hurdles in securing success? These are the questions addressed by the papers contained in this volume. Together the papers argue that new opportunities exist to make a Green Revolution for Africa possible but that greater attention must be given to the design and testing of new approaches that correspond to the specific conditions of Africa and the corresponding development of human capacity (de Janvry and Sadoulet); that the release of profitable new technologies will be the driving force inducing the necessary institutional changes and public investments in agriculture as it did in Asia (Otsuka and Kijima); that the hurdles of adverse OECD farm policies, property rights on new biological technologies and concentration of market power in integrated value chains must be addressed and removed (Oyejide); and that adapting the Green Revolution to climate change is a huge new challenge that will require large investments to reduce vulnerability to warming and extreme weather events and to enhance farmers' capacity to respond (Hassan). © The author 2010.

AB  - It is not possible to promote and protect global population health within a system based on economic growth. In fact, a socio-economic model primarily oriented toward growth, after a certain threshold, becomes counter-productive: over time, its advantages decrease exponentially until its negative effects outweigh its positive ones. Health is not immune from this process. Growth is based on the indiscriminate exploitation of natural and human capital: undermining the principal determinants of health via producing increasing damage to the environment, greater inequalities, and unhealthy consumerist cultures and lifestyles. This chapter makes the case that degrowth represents a radical alternative to the current political-economic system and its hegemonic orientation toward growth. It outlines how degrowth favors democratically led redistributive initiatives that engender production and consumption downscaling in industrialized countries to secure objectives of environmental sustainability, social justice, and welfare. Accordingly, the socio-economic and cultural changes promoted by degrowth would have substantial positive repercussions for planetary health, and provide the prerequisites to implement several fundamental health policies that remain largely proscribed in existing neoliberal and capitalist systems. In turn, by applying degrowth principles to the health field, the chapter presents the outline of an alternative model of medicine and health systems. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, David Primrose, Rodney Loeppky and Robin Chang; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Energy is one of the most important social and economic infrastructures and human life is strongly depends on it. In recent years, the occurrence of natural disasters such as drought as a high-impact low-probability event is undeniable. So, energy planning in the disruption situation is necessary in order to anticipate and maintain the performance of the energy system in optimal condition. This paper focuses on developing a hybrid long-term framework for evaluating the energy system resilience based on sustainability concept against drought. The model bridges the gap between long-term energy system planning in macro level and short-term switching operations or micro level modeling​ approach in response to drought resulted by climate change. The new resilience indexes are used to maximize the social welfare, to minimize the energy needed but not supplied (ENNS), to recover the system performance rapidly and minimum the total cost of the energy system after occurring drought. When disaster happens, the modeling of energy systems will do through two stages because the behavior of the system should be considered, compare and analyzed before and after disruption events. On the other hand, the system uncertainties, possible futures and different strategies can change the optimal path of the energy needed supply, which is examined by scenario analysis in the proposed model. So, the developed model is a two-stage optimization model with linear programming approach and scenario analyzing model with a combination of back-casting and forward future approaches Numerical model is performed on UTOPIA energy system and its results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021

AB  - The European Green Deal (EGD) aims to achieve a green transition and make the European Union climate-neutral in 2050. In this regard, the EGD has various implications for fossil fuel producers, and the cost of a just transition is very high for fossil fuel-dependent economies, particularly producers in the developing World. As in the 21st century, global concerns about CO2 emission, pursuing a green economy, economic development, climate change, and environmental pollution have become serious challenges for developed and developing worlds. In this chapter, we consider a comparative analysis of the EU Green Deal and fossil fuel economies, particularly oil-producing economies such as Iraq. Based on the content analyses, the empirical findings reveal that the EGD transformed Europe’s energy needs and dependence. At the same time, it brings severe economic challenges for fossil fuel economies. Based on the findings, this chapter suggests a few policy implications for fossil fuel producers in the light of EGD to tackle the shared challenges based on shared responsibility and securing a just transition for all since boosting economic development while keeping CO2 emissions low requires better cooperation and support from and with the EU. To adapt environmental policies properly, fossil fuel economies are required to consider the European political role in creating a shared responsibility for environmental consciousness applicability in regional environmental initiatives. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Marjorie Tendero and Christoph Weber; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Human well-being is the top priority of all nations in the twenty-first century. However, depletion of natural resources and financial risk can negatively impact human well-being, which in turn can make it difficult to realize human well-being. Also, green innovation and economic globalization may play a significant role in human well-being. In this context, this study assesses the impacts of natural resources, financial risk, green innovation, and economic globalization on human well-being in emerging countries from 1990 to 2018. The empirical results from the Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimator unveiled that natural resources and financial risk negatively affect the human well-being of emerging nations. Furthermore, the results show that green innovation and economic globalization positively contribute to human well-being. These findings are also verified using alternative methods. In addition, natural resources, financial risk, and economic globalization Granger cause human well-being but not the other way round. Furthermore, bidirectional causality exists between green innovation and human well-being. Considering these novel findings, sustainable utilization of natural resources and controlling financial risk are necessary strategies for realizing human well-being. More resources should be allocated for green innovation, and government should encourage economic globalization to attain sustainable development in emerging countries.

AB  - Due to fast urbanization and increasing living standards, the environmental sustainability of our global society becomes more and more questionable. In this historical review we investigate the role of resources management (RM) and urban planning (UP) and propose ways for integration in sustainable development (SD). RM follows the principle of circular causation, and we reflect on to what extent RM has been an element for urban planning. Since the existence of the first settlements, a close relationship between RM, urbanization and technological development has been present. RM followed the demand for urban resources like water, energy, and food. In history, RM has been fostered by innovation and technology developments and has driven population growth and urbanization. Recent massive resource demand, especially in relation to energy and material flows, has altered natural ecosystems and has resulted in environmental degradation. UP has developed separately in response to different questions. UP followed the demand for improved living conditions, often associated to safety, good manufacturing and trading conditions and appropriate sanitation and waste management. In history UP has been a developing research area, especially since the industrial era and the related strong urbanization at the end of the 18th century. UP responded to new emerging problems in urban areas and became increasingly complex. Nowadays, UP has to address many objectives that are often conflicting, including, the urban sustainability. Our current urban un-sustainability is rooted in massive resource consumption and waste production beyond natural limits, and the absence of flows from waste to resources. Therefore, sustainable urban development requires integration of RM into UP. We propose new ways to this integration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Different strategies to govern resource commons generate outcomes that can be assessed along different dimensions, in terms of the ecological or social sustainability of the resource system, contributions to the livelihoods of those who rely on these resources, or equity in the allocation of benefits. This paper reviews the existing literature concerning three major renewable resource commons, namely pasture lands, fisheries and irrigation water. Most existing work on these commons has been inattentive to the multiple outcomes that management of all renewable resources generates. Studies of commons can provide better information about livelihoods, sustainability and equity dimensions of natural resource governance outcomes than previously. Attending to the distinctive determinants and drivers of these outcomes and the nature of trade-offs and synergies among them has the potential to advance common property theory substantially. Possible relationships among livelihoods, sustainability and equity are identified, and the major explanations of outcomes advanced by scholars of fisheries, pastoral and irrigation commons reviewed. An interdisciplinary approach is needed to improve existing efforts to determine the outcomes that resource commons generate. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2011.

AB  - An agent-based model (ABM) is developed to explore the socio-hydrological and economic impacts of a water transfer project, as a supply enhancement strategy, on the cap-and-trade scheme, as a demand-side management practice, in Rafsanjan Plain, Iran. The modelling scheme benefits from a distributed groundwater model coupled with a socio-economic ABM to explore the social and economic impacts of the proposed supply enhancement and demand management strategies. The main goal of the integrated model is to investigate how the supply enhancement strategies and the cap-and-trade policy can bring about more favourable hydrological, social, and economic results in the recipient basin. Findings indicate that integration of the supply augmentation and the cap-and-trade policy can facilitate the emergence of collective action in the farmer society. It is shown that the combination of these two policies, when implemented to mitigate water scarcity, reduces economic costs incurred on both farmers and the government and brings about more favourable socio-hydrological outcomes. © 2021 IAHS.

AB  - Water availability, access, and use has ensured food and livelihood security for millions. In the future, food and livelihood security may be challenged due to global environmental changes, particularly global climatic changes, that evidence has gradually shown to be appearing. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected that the global mean surface temperature will rise by 1.4–5.8°C by 2100 due to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Climate variability is also projected to increase, leading to uncertainty in the onset of monsoons and more frequent extreme weather events, such as more severe droughts and floods. These environmental changes are known to affect all aspects of the hydrological cycle, which in turn may alter the balance between food demand and supply in time and space in many parts of the world. Regions such as South Asia and Africa are expected to be particularly vulnerable to these environmental changes due to their large population, predominance of agriculture, and limited resource base. The potential impact of climatic changes on the quality of fruits, vegetables, cereals and medicinal plants can have a negative impact on emerging trade opportunities for these commodities in many countries. To ensure future water and food security, greater attention is now needed on adaptations to climatic change, which calls for increased diversification, improved land use and natural resource management policies, increased use of biofuels, improved risk management through early warning systems and crop insurance, and wastewater recycling in agriculture. © 2010, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This study highlights the resource curse attached to the renewable energy abundance in low middle income countries. Renewable energy abundance diverts the focus of policies and investments from human capital development to the export of energy to high income countries who aim to diversify their energy mix for sustainable growth. This study analyses 76 low-middle income countries from 2010 to 2021 for energy curse channeled through low human capital development in the long run. This study incorporates the renewable energy curse into a Cobb-Douglas function and uses Index for human capital as a proxy for human capital development in a pooled fixed effects model. The results align with the expected hypotheses that renewable energy abundance negatively impacts human capital development, persistently, while we control for technology, infrastructure, health, energy poverty and FDI. The results call for policy implications that may help these countries to seek development in skill development, technological progress, manufacturing of renewable energy equipment and transparency of institutions as a strategy to cope up with the curse in the long run. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The African continent is receiving unprecedented pressure from population growth, urbanisation, decreased agricultural productivity and changing climate. However, the continent lacks technological advancement. Therefore, there is a need to apply global data and open geospatial tools for analysis to prevent, stop and comprehend the trend and effects of land degradation, food insecurity and the unsustainability of cities. The study takes three representative indicators (climate risk, land degradation and land consumption) from FAO’s four strategic better’s to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of global datasets to support decision makers. Three representative cities in Africa are selected for the study—Houet, Burkina Faso (West Africa); Kisumu, Kenya (East Africa); and Analamanga, Madagascar (South East Africa). The study found that eight Fokontany of the Analamanga region were at high risk from climate change; at the ward level, a maximum of 54.2% of the total degraded land area in Kisumu; and maximum land-consumption rate of 1.5 was found in Houet at the department level. The results of this study can be a basis for policymakers in planning an inclusive climate-adaptation measure and sustainable land-use frameworks and policies. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Since the concept of low carbon development (LCD) was adopted at the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, Indonesia has been committed to implementing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, the country issued Presidential Regulation No. 18, which made LCD one of the national priority programs to maintain economic and social through low emission activities and reduce the overexploitation of natural resources. The LCD is a way for the country to overcome the tradeoff between economic growth and environmental degradation. Nevertheless, LCD is a new initiative for Indonesia, so it needs strategic indicators that influence the achievement of development. This paper attempts to integrate macro-regional development indicators that combine each region’s gross domestic product, human development index, and unemployment rate with LCD indicators, including the environmental quality index and g reenhouse gas emissions. The combined indicators were constructed by composite index through the Shannon entropy method, geometric and arithmetic means using the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. The results show significant differences among provinces concerning to macro-regional indicators once the LCD indicators were incorporated. The results of this analysis could be used by policymakers to evaluate the green development of regions. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Understanding the factors that influence life expectancy (LEXP) is crucial for promoting economic development, as a nation's prosperity depends on the health of its population. Various socioeconomic, nutritional, lifestyle, genetic, and environmental factors can significantly impact a nation’s health and longevity. Our study investigates these drivers of LEXP, focusing on the United States as a case study. Using quarterly data from 2000 to 2022, we examined the relationship between LEXP and multiple determinants, including environmental degradation, income levels, inflation dynamics, educational attainment, birth and death rates, health expenditure patterns, urbanization trends, and infant mortality rates. Employing advanced analytical methodologies, we accounted for the nonlinear nature of the time series data by utilizing approaches such as quantile-on-quantile Kernel Regression Least Squares and quantile-on-quantile Granger causality. The study revealed that factors such as inflation rate, rapid urbanization, high birth rates, CO2 emissions, death rates, and infant mortality negatively affect LEXP. On the other hand, higher income levels, educational attainment, food production, and health expenditure positively influence LEXP. Based on these findings, we have proposed significant policy recommendations. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA), a concept originally coined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), has been presented as a solution to the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change. According to the FAO, CSA explicitly aims for three objectives: (1) to sustainably increase agricultural productivity to support equitable increases in farm incomes, food security and development; (2) to adapt and build resilience to climate change at multiple levels; and (3) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. This definition of CSA is central to ongoing debates between different groups of stakeholders, such as NGOs and policy-makers in developed and developing countries, over what exactly constitutes CSA, e.g. does it encompass large-scale industrial agriculture and small-scale agriculture, organic and non-organic farming practices, and which associated practices fall in its ambit. Thus, to frame CSA's efficacy for the future, it is important to explore how different groups of stakeholders define CSA. This study collects and analyses data from qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 30 active members of the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture (GACSA)-one of the most prominent organizations currently involved in shaping CSA policy. The interviewees include employees of governments, NGOs, research institutions, agribusiness companies and representatives of farmers' groups. Their responses reveal that for CSA practitioners within GACSA, doing CSA is perceived to be significantly more important than defining CSA or attempting to identify the differences between, for example, agroecology and CSA. Particularly challenging is to define what qualifies as "smart". Nevertheless, clarification of CSA is important for governments and policy-makers, in particular with regard to the use of inorganic fertilizers and GM technologies. Although these latter approaches are not explicitly promoted by GACSA, the membership of several "Big Ag" companies in the Alliance attracts criticism concerning the shaping of CSA's agenda and possible "greenwashing" by private interests. At the same time, the respondents note that some proponents of agroecology can be accused of "claiming the space as their own." Almost all interviewees stress the importance of a bottom-up approach based on shared governance and growth and placing farmers' needs first, rather than creating division among stakeholder groups. In addition, cooperation between farmers, researchers, and policymakers, as well as a context-specific approach to collaborative, data-driven education programmes are all cited as crucial for the future development of CSA. © 2019 University of Kassel.
