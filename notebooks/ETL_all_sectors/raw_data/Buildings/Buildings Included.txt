AB  - This multi-country article focuses particularly on homeownership among the young. After all, relying on European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) data in twelve European countries, we can see that in contrast to the aggregate homeownership rate of 'all' households (i.e., no matter what age the households' heads are) that has remained relatively stable, the aggregate homeownership rate of young households (with heads aged 0-35 years) has fallen substantially in Europe in recent decades. Multiple analyses and quantitative comparisons confirm the stylized fact that acquiring a home has indeed become a challenge for young adult households (also no matter the income quartile in which they fall); rather than that, however, their lowering homeownership rates are simply due to changing sociodemographic characteristics (such as having children later in life and staying longer in education). Moreover, it is unveiled that young tenants and lower income young households are especially disadvantaged with regard to access to the housing market. Through our actual research, we aim to answer the question: Has the government's fiscal policy strengthened or weakened the declining trend in young people's homeownership? After all, some evidence exists of an MID having a perverse effect, i.e., capitalizing on higher housing prices. However, multilevel mixed-effects logistic regressions reveal that the use of a mortgage interest deduction (MID) has had a significant positive effect on young adults' homeownership probability-with the strongest effect for the highest incomes. We believe that all the above results are-in the first place-relevant for governments that are willing to stimulate homeownership. They indicate that some (additional) policy interventions are indeed needed, next to or instead of granting an MID, and that the focus of housing policy should also (and more) be on tenants and those with lower incomes.

AB  - We conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis of studies with side-by-side life cycle analysis comparisons of mid-rise buildings using mass timber and conventional, concrete and steel, building materials. Based on 18 comparisons across four continents, we found that substituting conventional building materials for mass timber reduces construction phase emissions by 69%, an average reduction of 216 kgCO(2)e/m(2) of floor area. Studies included in our analysis were unanimous in showing emissions reductions when building with mass timber compared to conventional materials. Scaling-up low-carbon construction, assuming mass timber is substituted for conventional building materials in half of expected new urban construction, could provide as much as 9% of global emissions reduction needed to meet 2030 targets for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C. Realizing the climate mitigation potential of mass timber building could be accelerated by policy and private investment. Policy actions such as changing building codes, including mass timber in carbon offset crediting programs and setting building-sector-specific emissions reduction goals will remove barriers to and incentivize the adoption of mass timber. Private capital, as debt or equity investment, is poised to play a crucial role in financing mass timber building.

AB  - This paper is a quantitatively oriented theoretical study into the interaction between housing prices, aggregate production, and household behavior over a lifetime. We develop a life-cycle model of a production economy in which land and capital are used to build residential and commercial real estates. We find that in an economy where the share of land in the value of real estates is large, housing prices react more to an exogenous change in expected productivity or the world interest rate, causing a large redistribution between net buyers and net sellers of houses. Changing financing constraints, however, has limited effects on housing prices.

AB  - Window opening behavior has a vital influence on indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy consumption. In residential buildings, the window opening behavior of occupants may vary considerably owing to different indoor and outdoor environmental parameters and personal habits. In this study, we investigated the factors influencing the window opening behavior of occupants in 19 residences in Beijing by monitoring the open closed status of windows, and eight environmental parameters, including temperature and relative humidity of indoor and outdoor air, indoor CO2 concentration, outdoor PM2.5 concentration, and outdoor wind speed and direction. The influence of the season and time of day was also analyzed, and typical window operation schedules were determined. Predictive models of the occupants' window opening behavior were established based on multivariate linear logistic regression. The results indicated that outdoor air temperature was the most influential factor, followed by indoor CO2 concentration, indoor air temperature, outdoor and indoor relative humidity, ambient PM2.5 concentrations, and outdoor wind direction and wind speed.

AB  - Improved ventilation in an urban residential neighborhood is a determinant for better energy efficiency and air quality of the neighborhood. This is particularly important for the real estimates recently developed in many cities in China, as these neighborhoods are built with high density. In this paper, we consider in an idealized neighborhood with two categories of packaging building densities (lambda(p)) of 0.25 and 0.44, which respectively represent medium and compact urban development. For each packaging density, the frontal area density of arrays is varied from 0.125 to 0.5 through adding building blocks and reducing building size simultaneously. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are carried out to predict the wind flow through the building arrays by the use of renormalization group (RNG) k-epsilon turbulence model. Our predictions are validated by comparing with experimental data. Numerical results reveal that ventilation rate could be greatly enhanced when a low level of packaging building density is maintained. The momentum exchange rate at the canopy roof level is effectively strengthened when the frontal area density decreases, together with a reduction of ventilation in the urban canopy layer (UCL). Additionally, a linear relationship is found between the UCL ventilation rate and the momentum exchange rate at the urban canopy roof level. For a constant packaging density, reducing frontal area density improves the city block ventilation by enhancing the air exchange rate at the roof level rather than increasing horizontal drag. This paper also illustrates a practical strategy in optimum neighborhood building layout design to minimize the pollutant level. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The notion of collaborative consumption or sharing economy-where consumers share access to ownership of properties such as cars, clothes and accommodations-has gained tremendous popularity in recent years. Development of communication technologies and peer-to-peer communities has enabled consumers to coordinate sharing activities through various online platforms. Collaborative consumption involves sharing of both intangible (e.g., music, space and car rides) and tangible assets (e.g., household items, clothes and furniture). Activities such as renting, swapping, trading and purchasing/selling used consumer goods are included in the latter. Despite increasing academic attention on collaborative consumption, little research has been pursued in the context of consumer goods. The nature of consumption for tangible goods can be entirely different from that of intangible goods because people can exercise greater control over tangible goods, which results in greater psychological ownership than that for intangible goods. To address this gap, the objective of this study is to develop a scale that examines consumer motivations for collaborative consumption of consumer goods. Following Churchill's paradigm of scale development, the procedures of scale item generation, purification and validation were conducted via in-depth interviews, literature review and surveys. The study identified five underlying dimensions of collaborative consumption of consumer goods: concern-for-sustainability, social, variety-seeking, fun and cost-saving. Study findings and implications are discussed, and future research avenues are suggested.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the decision-making process and outcomes associated with downsizing to a smaller home in late life. Older adults who had downsized in the past year (n = 68) were recruited across the U. S. between 2018 and 2019 and were interviewed eithr in person or over the phone. Participants completed selfreport measures of push-pull factors driving the decision to move, relocation controllability, sense of place (SOP), and relocation outcomes (i.e., move satisfaction and psychological well-being). Placing greater importance on push relative to pull factors was associated with lower levels of well-being in three domains: environmental mastery, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. Results of serial mediation analyses suggested that older adults whose downsizing decisions were more strongly influenced by push factors, felt less control over relocation, found it more difficult to develop SOP in the new home, and, in turn, experienced lower levels of psychological well-being and move satisfaction. These findings can be used to inform older adults' downsizing decisions and develop supports for relocating older adults.

AB  - The multi-decade housing crisis has emerged as a critical aspect of both the ability of individuals to remain housed within the community as well as a critical health concern that impacts the long-term well-being through the presence or absence of both physical space and facilities in the home. We employ national state-level data from the American Community Survey (ACS) and aggregated measures from the Annual Disability Statistics Compendium to analyze six housing metrics-complete kitchen and plumbing access, overcrowding, housing cost burden, old housing, and poor housing. Using a lagged time-series regression analysis, we found the prevalence of cost burdened households in 2022 when accounting for individual and compounding housing metrics, and housing types, from 2019 to 2022, across community-living adults by disability status. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the carryover effects of housing issues is a greater contributor to housing cost burden than concurrent housing issues. This compounding and multi-faceted crisis further demonstrates that housing conditions and affordability need to be considered primary factors in the study and support of people with disabilities. Additionally, there is an urgent need for inclusive housing policies that address the challenges faced by disabled individuals to promote equitable access to sustainable, quality housing as a fundamental component of public health.

AB  - This article examines the connection between language shift and architectural shift in the Panamanian village of Old Bank on the Western Caribbean island of Bastimentos. The process of shift from Creole vernacular forms-both linguistic and architectural-to "prestigious" Panamanian forms is analyzed through an ethnographic lens focused on the spatial coordinates of social interaction. Language choice and the restructuring of communicative practices are shown to intersect in vital ways with architectural choice and the restructuring of the built environment. This essay suggests that vernacular shift in Old Bank is presently being held in check by the emergent covert prestige of Creole forms in a region where international tourism is fast supplanting the banana industry as the primary economic activity.

AB  - Architectural style is a medium for the promotion of cultural identities and cohesion. South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations provide a prism through which all forms of vernacular architecture can be viewed. This study is presented through the lens of the soul of the eye coupled with the power of technological probing. This synthesis affords a most appealing and lyrical exploration of the course of the development of cities within the SAARC nations. It showcases research results combining the above stated synergy-starting from some of SAARC's sophisticated historic cultures, cultures that ebbed and flowed along its shores and valleys. This paper shall touch upon unique cultural roots stretching back to the Dravidian civilization that flourished over 3500 years ago and also look at the grouping of houses within the Indus Valley Civilization in Lothal and the Sarasvati Valley Civilization in Kalibangan. The sensitivity underlying SAARC architecture and its traditions are seen in many communal settlements, profoundly so in the Indian subcontinent and in Sri Lanka. The paper shall showcase two specific, but nevertheless, distinct styles of communal functioning within unique architectural strongholds in the ancient Ratnagiri University in Odisha, India, and also touch upon a unique blend of styles of landscape architecture in Sri Lanka. The overarching emphasis of this study is that throughout SAARC's history, architecture has been creatively adopted to the need of its users and the characteristics of its climate and location. It has always fulfilled the needs and nourished the spirit of its people, promoting cultural cohesion even today. In this context, it is interesting to explore traditional techniques of vernacular architecture in houses in Andhra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The common thread linking mass housing in Lothal, Kalibangan, Anuradhapura and Ratnagiri about 2 millennia ago, with present day housing patterns, is in the application of sustainable building practices using intelligent building forms, fabric and orientation. This paper explores this commonality from a modern perspective using CFD. As the SAARC countries still struggle to get a fuller understanding of their unique ecology and the complexity of their diverse cultures, revisiting the architectural legacy of their indigenous societies might prove insightful. The need for this revisit becomes even more relevant in the wake of the Paris Agreement and more recently the Kigali Agreement. The discourse on providing indoor thermal comfort to the SAARC people cannot be decoupled from the climate change story-heating, ventilation and cooling consume a large amount of energy and have a deep underlying link with the targets set at Paris and Kigali. The onus will be on a large number of stakeholders to meet these targets-engineers, architects, manufacturers, policy-makers, researchers and consumers. This paper aims at reminding the stakeholders of the richness and the usefulness of their vernacular architecture in upholding the ideal of sustainability.

AB  - This paper addresses the challenge of incorporating occupant behavior into building performance simulation models used during the design process that is, before the actual occupants are known. It proposes the use of synthetic population data, an approach that is novel in building performance modeling although common in urban planning and public health. A simpler approach embodied in the ASHRAE Fundamentals volume is to report standard distributions of values for behavioral variables, assuming that parameters vary independently of one another when in fact many co-vary or are interdependent. An alternative approach calibrates models of occupant behavior against actual occupants in specific existing buildings, but this raises questions of transferability. Needed is a database of "generic" occupants that designers can use prospectively during the design process. This paper documents a process of combining disparate field studies of commercial buildings into a larger occupant behavior database and generating a statistically similar synthetic data set that can be shared without compromising confidentiality requirements associated with field studies. The synthetic data set successfully incorporates much of the covariance structure of the underlying field data and supports multivariate modeling. Its scope and structure necessarily serve the needs of the associated modeling framework. Cooperative and systematic sharing of data by field researchers is crucial for building large enough data sets to serve as a behaviorally-robust basis for building design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the last decade, there have been an increasing number of interventions that rely on social norms to leverage support for changes in behavior. Many of these interventions target environmentally relevant behaviors such as water and energy consumption, most commonly at the household level. In this paper, we present a field experiment that examines the impact of social norms on petition signing addressing energy consumption in a University campus building. Our results indicate that social norms have an impact on student's support for the initiative, with 5% more students signing a petition to adjust the building's thermostat by 2 degrees F when informed that 90% of students initially agreed to sign the petition. Our research highlights that social norms can be used to influence individual behavior in a petition signing context, which is more likely to lead to permanent change, than those contexts where individuals need to repeatedly sustain these changes individually over time.

AB  - The city is a historical and social product and it is produced by the action of concrete subjects with particular interests, most of the times related to the production and reproduction of the capital. In this logic the city of Londrina is inserted, since its urban expansion, since its genesis until the recent decades, is highlighted by the action of land owners and the real estate market in the production of the urban space, highlighting the construction of housing developments as a vector for the expansion of the urban perimeter. The aim of this study was to analyze the guidelines and the dynamics of the urban planning of the urban territory of Londrina as the construction of the housing complexes is carried out through the Brazilian housing policy. For this purpose, it was used surveys in theoretical and documental secondary sources. It is concluded that the transformation of the city into an enterprise to produce houses, with the real estate valuation and speculation, has legitimated the idea of the city produced to earn income from the urban land which promotes a segregationist territorial planning.

AB  - This article explores the links between urban restructuring, homelessness, and collective action in Toronto in the 1980s and 1990s. In Toronto, as elsewhere, urban restructuring at this time comprised a series of interconnected political-economic and spatial shifts, including economic and occupation change, gentrification, neo-liberal welfare state reform, and urban entrepreneurialism. Jointly, these political-economic shifts were implicated in the production and consolidation of new forms of socio-spatial polarization and segregation that dramatically changed the landscape of urban poverty. One of the most visible manifestations of the uneven effects of restructuring was the emergence and consolidation of mass homelessness. This changing landscape of poverty, in turn, produced a new landscape of political activism. It is this contested landscape that I explore in this article through a focus on homelessness as a primary mobilizing issue in opposition to restructuring during this key period in Toronto's transition into a second-tier world city. I argue that urban restructuring, homelessness, and the dynamics of collective action were linked in two important ways. First, collective advocates and activists defined the crisis of homelessness as a direct effect of urban restructuring; in this way collective action mobilized to defend the interests of homeless people was simultaneously a collective struggle to contest urban restructuring. Second, the politics of restructuring directly informed the dynamics of collective action over time, influencing their organizational, strategic, and tactical dimensions.

AB  - This paper describes a modelling analysis of the role different urban forms might play in reducing building CO2 emissions. The study was based on a residential building in a Cairo neighbourhood under summer conditions and developed a base case urban layout covering an area of 1 km(2). Three alternative urban strategies were then created around the same residential building. The software package EnviMet was used to assess external microclimate and thermal comfort conditions in each urban layout. Localised weather files were then created as inputs to the dynamic thermal modelling package DesignBuilder, which predicted the CO2 emissions associated with mechanical cooling to achieve comfort in the building. It was possible to observe some differences in CO2 emissions as a result of the different urban forms.

AB  - New spaces to accommodate growing urban populations should be created in a way that also reduces building lifecycle carbon emissions. In this context, the vertical extension (VE) has emerged as a novel building typology that can increase space in cities through the construction of additional floor area atop existing base buildings. This paper presents a review of 172 VE projects worldwide to provide an understanding of their design and construction trends, and to classify the technologies applied. Results show that VE construction has accelerated significantly over the past decade. Although most VEs consist of only small vertical additions, often one to two storeys, higher VEs can be built with innovative structural strategies and lightweight materials. Industrial buildings are often found to provide significant opportunities for VE due to their higher structural capacity. By comparing the characteristics and design of VEs, typologies based on architectural, structural, and construction technologies are presented.

AB  - This paper presents a study about studentification in a small, compact Spanish city. Unlike most of the previously analysed cases, students of this city share flats instead of living in houses in multiple occupancy. The studentification, which is hardly perceptible in the streets or the neighbourhood, becomes a reality in the staircase community, giving rise to the term 'vertical studentification'. A survey was conducted amongst university students to locate and quantify the floating population of students. Also, long-term residents and landlords were interviewed to assess the impact of students on the communities of apartment blocks. The study reveals that studentification does happen in a high-rise morphology but in a vertical and hidden way, making policy implications less straightforward.

AB  - The main objective of this research was to investigate what older adults think about the idea of living in micro-housing as an affordable housing option in Salt Lake City. By conducting interviews with 20 individuals over 65 years old, we discovered that they prefer Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) and micro apartments. Participants expressed concerns about tiny homes. The participants highlighted the importance of having a sense of community and access to amenities when choosing their housing. Additionally, they still preferred single-family homes because of space and financial factors. These findings offer insights for housing developers, architects, and policymakers who aim to create cities that are both sustainable and livable for people of all age groups.

AB  - There are debates about whether job-housing balance and short commuting distances could be achieved through government intervention in Western countries. However, few studies have been carried out in developing context. The present study aims to fill in this knowledge vacuum by studying how China's changing socio-spatial context, particularly the spatial ideas of danwei, influences job-housing relationships and commuting patterns from a historical perspective. The results clearly show that the dominant trend in commuting patterns in Chinese cities has changed from intra-danwei commuting before 1978 to reverse commuting from the city center to the inner suburbs in 1978-1998, to long-distance suburb-to-city commuting since 1998. The findings suggest that government intervention could be helpful in achieving shorter commute in China, and that urban planning and policy that promote mixed land-use and job-housing balance should be considered. Some limitations of government intervention are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article reviews the literature on changing housing aspirations and expectations in contemporary housing systems. It argues that there is a conceptual and definitional gap in relation to the term 'housing aspirations', as distinct from expectations, preferences, choices and needs. The article sets out working definitions of these terms, before discussing the evidence on changing housing (and related) systems. Emerging research has begun to consider whether trends such as declining homeownership, affordability concerns and precarious labour systems across a range of countries are fundamentally changing individuals' aspirations for the forms of housing they aim to access at different stages of their lives. Whilst much of the research into housing aspirations has been considered in terms of tenure, and homeownership in particular, this article suggests that research needs to move beyond tenure and choice frameworks, to consider the range of dimensions that shape aspirations, from the political economy and the State to socialization and individuals' dispositions for housing.

AB  - In the last few decades, informality has became the dominant feature of urban growth on the periphery of Greater Cairo and in the city of Alexandria, which is the second-largest urban area in Egypt. This results in diverse and complex informal housing development. Three main forms of housing-semi-informal, squats and ex-formal-have emerged, all of them making use of agricultural or desert lands. Various actors have been involved in the informal development process. Understanding the built environment of informal housing developments would enable the state and housing professionals to provide better information about quantification and valuation in this sector, and promote economic development. The value of informal property should be harnessed to promote development and alleviate poverty.

AB  - Residential self-selection potentially influences both the built environment at the residential location and travel behavior. However, the impact of (travel-related) residential self-selection on residential relocation is not yet clear. We analyzed a sample of 3,629 German respondents planning to relocate. This allows us to examine the relationship between the motivation to relocate, residential satisfaction and residential dissonance as a mismatch between travel attitudes and the structure of the neighborhood. We develop a binary and a continuous indicator of residential dissonance. The binary indicator classifies 35% of respondents as dissonant. Two logistic regression analyses model the probability of indicating the neighborhood as a reason for a planned move among urban and non-urban residents. Residential dissonance is found to have an impact on the satisfaction with the neighbor-hood, but there are other characteristics that make residents want to leave their current neighborhood, such as dissatisfaction with the neighbors, safety and cleanliness and quietness. In non-urban areas, the satisfaction with the quality of transit motivates relocations, while dissatisfaction with the accessibility of the workplace, shopping facilities and leisure activities for young people are important reasons for urban residents. The results suggest that dissatisfaction toward travel-related characteristics of a neighborhood has a significant, though small in-fluence on the desire to leave the current neighborhood but the more general 'dissonance' does not. Hence, characteristics respondents value may be more specific, rather than reflecting a general preference for urban vs. non-urban areas. We draw some conclusions for transport policies in urban and non-urban areas.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a better understanding of how transportation system factors affect city housing markets. The goal was to show that identifying these factors alone is not enough without also examining their effects and variations according to the housing location. Design/methodology/approach Transportation system factors were identified by conducting a thorough literature review. The factors' relevance was tested using a quantitative methodology and a sample of 317 Vilnius residents. This city was next divided into three zones, and data collected from 18 real estate experts was subjected to qualitative analysis. The analytic hierarchy process was then applied to identify transportation system factors' level of impact and dynamics by the housing location. Findings The results show that the factors affect the housing market in question but that these effects vary by the housing location and the most critical factors differ for each city zone. Research limitations/implications - Only data on Vilnius were used. Further research is needed to compare transportation factors' dynamics in multiple cities. Practical implications - Priorities in transportation system improvements should be assessed to facilitate sustainable urban development and enhance the residents' quality of life. Housing market regulations can only be successful if investment in transportation systems is allocated purposefully and coherently. Originality/value - This research went beyond identifying transportation system factors by employing a broad, systematic approach to clarifying potential options for regulating housing markets through transportation system projects.

AB  - When families rely on public transport rather than automobiles for travel needs, they spend less of their disposable income on transport. The need to travel long distances outside their own communities is reduced when they shop, work, recreate, socialise and learn in an accessible local context. In light of the decrease in housing affordability and the anticipated increasing costs of fuel, the simple concepts underlying the application of Transit-Supportive Home Loan instruments such as the Location Efficient Mortgage (R) (LEM) could well be an initiative which could allow entry into the housing market by those who otherwise would not be able to afford to purchase a home and would also reduce reliance on the motor vehicle and reliance on non-renewable fuels. LEMs are seen in the United States as a way to encourage public transport use and compact development, increase home ownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income families, support local neighbourhood businesses and discourage excessive auto-use and urban fringe development. A number of financial institutions in the US are also supportive of LEMs because they are consistent with community lending criteria and expose a broader range of income levels to the housing market. This paper provides an outline of the existing transit-supportive home loan arrangements available in the US and investigates success of implementation. Finally, it assesses the potential application of these lending mechanisms in Australia and their potential impacts on accessibility, urban form, housing affordability and the use of the private motor vehicle with a focus on policy initiatives which would be required to implement them.

AB  - Vernacular and modem architecture hove mostly been seen as antitheses, impossible to reconcile, especially in Africa. They appear to belong to different ages, utilize different materials and methods, and encourage or support different lifestyles. This paper aims of seeking points where a merging of principles may be attempted between the two positions. The study is based on a survey on the traditional architecture of the Yoruba people of West Africa. The decline in popular use of this building tradition and its rejection by design practitioners raises some physical and psychological issues which ore examined in this paper. These include: spatial layout, use and quality, ecology and economy, concepts, meaning and perception. The fate of Yoruba traditional built culture depends on a conscious attempt to reconcile it with peopled contemporary needs, lifestyles and world views. Therefore, a brief introduction on the importance of Yoruba architecture and its preservation will be followed by a general definition of its features and characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the problems posed by the architecture modem trends in Yoruba land will be examined. It is hoped that such works may assist in the development of a truly responsive and sustainable architecture for the Yoruba people. The proposed solutions may be applied in other parts of Africa, or in regions with similar cultural or geographical concerns.

AB  - The activities of construction, renovation and demolition related to the dwelling (housing) stock have a strong impact on both material and energy demands. A deeper understanding of the dynamics driving these activities is a precondition for a more consistent way to address material and energy demands. The method presented herein is based on a dynamic material flow analysis and is applied to the Norwegian dwelling stock. Input data to the model are population and socio-economic lifestyle indicators such as the average number of persons per dwelling and the average size of dwellings; these determine the size of the floor area stock. Parameters such as the lifetime of dwellings and renovation intervals complete the input set. Outputs of the model are the stock and flows of floor area for the period 1900-2100. Analysis of the renovation activity is given particular attention. Several scenarios are considered in order to test the model's sensitivity to input's uncertainties. Results are compared with statistical data, where the latter are available. The main conclusion is that in the coming decades renovation is likely to overtake construction as the major activity in the Norwegian residential sector.

AB  - People living in short-term rental housing, henceforth temporary housing, are rarely consulted by professionals involved in the design process, whether regarding new or refurbished buildings. Knowing what is required for temporary dwellers to feel at home and how their meanings of home relate to household characteristics, activities, and indoor environmental quality, might result in better designs for these commonly small dwellings. To explore the views of temporary occupants about their home environment, we designed and conducted a survey directed to young people in the Netherlands, likely to be familiar with living in temporary accommodation (141 university students, 58 refugees who have received a permit to stay; henceforth named permit holders), 23 persons who were working 4 days and studying 1 day; henceforth named starters). Through factor analysis, six meanings of home were found to be statistically significant: Representation, privacy, sociability, rootedness, future, and appropriation. Multiple regression analyses and analyses of variance indicated that meanings of home were related to some household characteristics and the presence of light and cleanliness. Our study showed that measuring meanings of home might help understand not only how dwellings are used but also how to improve the design of small temporary dwellings. For instance, more possibilities for good or natural light, storage, and the display of personal possessions should be incorporated into the design of these small dwellings.

AB  - Traditional architectural typologies could play a crucial role in the environmental architectural contemporary framework, due to many attempts developed in last decades to adopt passive house model and bioclimatic criteria in the Mediterranean areas. According to climate responsive approach, the interactive and adaptive relationship between building, site, and climate consider a basic rule to reduce the environmental impact and improving energy efficiency in buildings. In recent decades this concept has extended to the preservation of the cultural identity of the places. High level of adaptive, sustainable and functional performances could be deduced from the traditional residential buildings as the case of Aleppo proves. The traditional Arab house in Aleppo is based on series of adaptive and sustainable-oriented principles derived from the integration of active and interactive design approaches. The old city of Aleppo (included in the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites) is considered one of the largest historical cities in the world, in terms of its population number (110,000 people before the war). The damage to cultural and historical heritage by the war asserts the peculiarity of the city in the Eastern Mediterranean area. This paper presents the study that the authors are carrying out on Aleppo, considering the bioclimatic approach as a key element to reorient the future construction process of the Syrian city to achieve the objectives of global sustainability and identify design criteria's for the development of the residential buildings. The study also aims to analyse the mutations which appeared through evolution process of residential buildings and identify the invariant elements and the main trajectories of modification established in the past, confirming their compatibility with the future development of Aleppo.

AB  - Cities all over the world are experiencing a steady tension that from interlinked processes such as touristification, gentrification and the financialization of housing. This paper shows how short-term rentals (STR) are an accelerator to all these processes which pull in or redirect different forms of capital and short-term users on the one hand and push out long-term residents on the other. Based on fine-grained fieldwork this paper illustrates that a new platform real estate market has emerged which, in the case of Salzburg, is dominated by local, commercial providers. By taking one of the most touristified cities in Europe, I further illustrate how a short-term rent gap is fueling this process. Moreover, this paper reveals the motives of extraction, and actor-relations and analyses the impact of Airbnb on the housing market in general. Finally, it provides an overview and critique of recent policy measures that try to regulate STR.

AB  - Housing has become pivotal in attracting and retaining talent in first-tier cities. Although numerous cities are actively promoting the provision of talent housing in China, little is known about the talent's evaluations of talent housing policies or the effect on their urban settlement intention. This paper aims to investigate whether talent housing alleviates the housing difficulties of talent and its role in retaining talent. A questionnaire was conducted face-to-face in talent housing in Shanghai. Binary logistic regression was employed to analyse the factors significantly contributing to the settlement intentions of the talent. Talent housing was confirmed to alleviate the talent's housing pressures and further increase their urban settlement intention. The local hukou was determined to be crucial in accelerating the willingness of talent to settle in Shanghai. However, housing affordability (including school district housing) may jeopardise such positive effects. It is crucial to provide more choices of talent housing and increase the coverage of good-quality educational resources. In the long run, more talent can be attracted and retained in the locality under a broader coverage of the talent housing scheme.

AB  - This paper discusses the importance of understanding the ecology as part of architectural education. Rather than focusing on the heat phenomenon as frequently researched, this paper explores the opposite ideas by identifying the concept of cool pocket and designing it as a mean for heat mitigation in a tropical built environment. Recent researches show that providing a microclimate that responds human thermal comfort can contribute to the building energy performance and at the same time promote activities in outdoor space. The relation and interaction among various microclimate factors with the land, water body, arrangement of vegetations, building's geometry and configurations, create different scenarios of the thermal condition, including possible cool pocket. Using air temperature and wind as indicators, possibilities of cool pocket will be explored and investigated through CFD Simulation. The result shows the importance of ecological understanding as part of designing cool pocket in a tropical context in a learning process and scenario-based simulation in developing design strategies.

AB  - Whereas the literature largely assumes that original residents are displaced from their communities following the implementation of market-oriented housing regeneration, this study indicates that such housing regeneration can also enable lower-middle class homeowners to turn their homes into an economic springboard. First, we argue that the social effects of the day after regeneration are the result of a process of social and spatial rupture that occurs during the extended pre-regeneration period. Therefore, understanding the social implications of urban regeneration requires us to view the act of regeneration in the broad historical context of the long-standing deterioration of the social fabric and the built environment. Second, we hold that these conditions lay the basis for an individualization of advancing personal profit through which homeowners advance the regeneration of the residences in their building while internalizing a discourse of "real-estatization" toward "self-gentrification." The article examines this dynamic by focusing on homeowners in a disadvantaged environment located at the heart of real-estate interest in Israel.

AB  - The article is devoted to the theoretical study of energy efficiency and a feasibility of using the technology of a "green roof" in the coatings of public buildings for large and great cities. The need to optimize energy consumption in large cities becomes a prerequisite for the improvement and implementation of innovative, energy-saving and technological systems as a method of solving the problem of energy efficiency of buildings. During creation of a "green roof" in the coating of the building, there is an increase in its energy efficiency, which is the result of reducing heat losses through the outer coating for heating in winter. A qualitative comparative analysis of the results of thermal calculations of existing non-operated insulated roofs and their coatings reorganized into the operated "green roof" is made for two public buildings. According to the results of calculations, the assessment of energy efficiency of public buildings coating when constructing a "green roof" is made. The present study shows that the construction of a "green roof" with a substrate thickness of 300 mm in the coating of two public buildings leads to an increase in heat transfer resistance of more than 5%, which leads to a decrease in energy consumption.

AB  - The paper examines the situation of low-income rental accommodation and identifies the policy alternatives for those in housing poverty. In urban South Korea, there are different kinds of rental types and rental housing that are commonly used by low-income groups. Most of the poor are tenants in the substandard settlements and illegal rented rooms, so called Jjogbang, in the inner city areas. Since the IMF crisis, Jjogbang has bridged the gap between the unemployed and the poor's housing needs and supply. The housing authorities focused on the expansion of state-developed housing for sale rather than the provision of rental accommodation. In order to get progressive realization of the right to adequate housing of the poor and disadvantaged groups, active participation of our public, private and non-governmental partners at all levels is sought to ensure legal security of tenure protection from discrimination and equal access to adequate housing for all persons and their families.

AB  - Deinstitutionalisation, one of the most significant social policies of the last century, was introduced into Australia from the 1960s, and involved the closure or downsizing of large institutions and the integration of people with disability and mental illness into the community. One of the community-based accommodation options for people leaving institutions was boarding houses. This paper presents the findings of a study into the use of licensed boarding houses for people with intellectual disability and people with mental illness in Sydney, Australia. The study aimed to explore how boarding houses operate as an accommodation option within the policy of deinstitutionalisation and the extent to which this accommodation type upholds human rights principles and contributes to residents' quality of life. Forty interviews were conducted with a range of participants including current and former residents, proprietors of licensed boarding houses, and staff of community organisations and government agencies about licensed boarding houses and the quality of life of residents. The study found that licensed boarding houses are a form of transinstitutionalisation and do not serve to enact the human rights principles articulated in current policy and legislation. ???????????????????????????,?????????????????????????????????,????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,???????????????????????????,?????????????????????????????????????????????????????,??????????,?????????????,???????????????????

By using a conceptual structure based on the architectural main components, it is possible to recognize the interrelations established in the past, and the ones crucial to respect in the present. The architectural values of the historic center of Oporto are analyzed, regarding the interactions of both its generative main topics and inherent sustainable values. In our historic centers we can see sustainability within architecture, as a whole, helping us to understand what components we must focus, why, when and where. Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Until the recent housing market crisis, the United States was producing first-time, low-income homeowners at an unprecedented rate. In a longitudinal study of low-income renters participating in a multi-site homeownership education program, we examine the ability of low-income homebuyers to pay housing related costs after home purchase, including maintenance or repairs costs. After less than two years of ownership, we find the sustainability of low-income homeownership in jeopardy for sizeable portion of home buyers. About half of the more than 350 new home owners surveyed face unexpected costs, and about a third confront home repairs they cannot afford. More than half carry greater non-housing debt, and about a quarter were 30 days late or more in debt repayment. The findings raise concerns about the long term sustainability of low-income homeownership and emphasize the importance of requiring effective pre-purchase services and effective and ongoing post-purchase counseling.

AB  - On the background of current global mortgage crisis the article discusses the housing market theory and particularly the methods and indicators used for the evaluation of long-term sustainability of house price trends. The authors provide the time series of such indicators for selected OECD countries, critically examine the past research studies evaluating pre-crisis house price development and argue that house price falls present in many developed countries are more the causes than the consequences of mortgage crisis. The change in house price trends in 2007 in many developed countries could be thus interpreted as the result of the previous record house price growth, often labeled as a price bubble. In view of this hypothesis the authors try to assess the sustainability of house price development in the Czech Republic, using several indicators, error correction models and different data sources. The Methods for construction of reliable house price indices are also discussed here. The results show that house prices in the Czech Republic could be above their "equilibrium" levels at the end of 2007 but this deviation was far lower than in countries like UK, Spain, Netherlands or Ireland.

AB  - This study presents an assessment of the political economy of housing in contemporary Turkey in conversation with the main issues of the financialization of housing (FoH) debate. Since the early 2000s, the built-environment scene in Turkey has been undergoing a radical transformation toward a situation characterized by growing penetration of financial concerns into the housing sector. FoH in Turkey, however, is remarkably different from typical Global North examples in terms of the current depth of the process, prevalent mechanisms, leading components, and driving actors. The Turkish case is characterized by a relatively small financial footprint generating an unprecedented construction boom, under the command of a decisive and persistent state strategy. Going well beyond the enabling/facilitating role of states covered in the existing literature, this strategy represents a case in which the state itself effectively drives the housing-finance nexus.

AB  - A critical aspect of China's economic modernization, one that has been infrequently addressed either in policy papers or scholarly studies, is the linkage between labor-market and housing-market reform. Labor-market mobility requires that workers and their families be able to find housing in areas of high labor demand. This critical linkage will be facilitated by movement away from employer-provided housing to a system in which each household is responsible for finding, securing, and paying for its own lodging. We find evidence that in China's dual labor market, nonagricultural wage rates are sufficiently above market-clearing levels that eliminating employer-provided housing from workers' compensation will not require a concomitant increase in monetary wages. We also find indirect evidence that higher housing rents increase the quantity of available housing, thus facilitating interprovincial migration to favored areas.

AB  - The housing first (HF) model for individuals experiencing homelessness and mental illness differs by design from traditional models that require consumers to achieve "housing readiness" by meeting program or treatment prerequisites in transitional housing settings prior to permanent housing placement. Given a growing body of evidence for its favorable outcomes and cost effectiveness, HF is increasingly seen as an alternative to and argument against these traditional programs. As such, it is important that the elements and implementation challenges of the HF model be clearly understood and articulated. This qualitative study explored a largely unexamined aspect of the HF model-the need for and meaning of temporary residential settings (interim housing), a place to stay while waiting to secure permanent housing-using interviews and focus groups with service providers and consumers who experienced interim housing during implementation of HF in a large urban center. Although interim housing may not be necessary for all programs implementing the model, our study revealed numerous reasons and demands for safe, flexible interim housing options, and illustrated how they influence the effectiveness of consumer recovery, continuous service engagement, and housing stability.

AB  - This article deals with how the authorities taught the Swedes to live and how Swedish citizens came to accept such an intimate encroachment in their private lives. Why did people accept these social experts of everyday life? The answer tells us something about modern society and modernity itself. Around the turn of the 20th century, Stockholm had one of Europe's worst housing conditions, according to Swedish experts of the time. One-room apartments were the norm, even for large families. Not all buildings had running water and often several families shared one outhouse. At the same time, the idea that the home was the place in which the conscientious citizens of the future would be raised was introduced - in Sweden as elsewhere. Dwellings became part of the social question. Many people believed that a well-functioning home would improve other aspects of life as well: men would stay at home in the evening instead of going to pubs; women would do a better job of raising the children; and public health would improve. A neglected home was seen as a sign of the exact opposite; the right to a nice home turned into a duty to live well. As an extension of this idea, housing inspections became important processes in the effort to improve the lives of citizens. The inspections were carried out by municipal employees, who were expected to monitor people's everyday lives. They functioned as housing experts, but what did these social engineers actually do? How did they become housing experts? And was their encroachment into people's daily lives accepted by ordinary citizens?

AB  - This study analyzes the Korean housing market using an agent-based simulation from financial and societal perspectives. We initialize heterogeneous household agents using microlevel household survey data from Korea, and we model housing decisions and interactions through a simulated market. First, we validate and calibrate the model to reproduce real-world observations and several stylized facts about the Korean housing market. Then, we conduct a policy experiment to determine the impact of changes in the quantity and cost of housing finance on households' living conditions and wealth inequality. As proxies for the quantity of housing finance, we adopt the loan-to-value and debt-to-income regulation ratios, classified as macroprudential policy, which are the leverage measures used by the Korean government. The interest rate, one of the levers of monetary policy, is also used as a proxy for housing finance costs. The results of the policy experiment confirm that the quantitative expansion of housing finance provides more benefits to high-income households, thereby worsening wealth inequality. In addition, we find that an increase in housing finance costs lowers the incentive to speculate on housing, but this speculation does not improve the housing status of middle-income households. Finally, we demonstrate that macroprudential policies mitigate the exacerbation of wealth inequality in a relaxed monetary policy state.

AB  - There is growing concern for the affordability of daily travel. The proportion of household budgets spent on transport is significant, including fuel and/or public transport fares. Transit costs, especially for middle to low-income groups, are associated with a household's housing location choice. In many cases, households are making trade-offs by either spending more on housing in the inner city, with lower transport costs, or choosing more affordable housing in suburban areas, with higher commuting cost. As such, transport and housing costs are interrelated not only due to their substantial share in household budgets, but they are also linked as fundamental elements of urban systems. Understanding the pattern and linkages of both transport and housing affordability is important to support the formulation of transport policies. This paper aims to quantitatively examine transport and housing affordability by exploring middle- to low-income household's transport and housing expenses in the Bandung Metropolitan Area (BMA), Indonesia. Households in nine locations within BMA with various housing type and spatial characteristics were surveyed. Collected data from 405 households are used to measure variables including fuel, parking, maintenance cost, public transport fares, rent and owners' equivalent rent. In addition to the widely applied housing and transport (H + T) affordability ratio measure, this study proposes an alternative way to measure affordability using the interval data envelopment analysis (DEA) method. The analysis measures each housing location's performance in terms of transport, housing, and overall affordability. Having the interval affordability performance scores sorts out the data variability problem as well as provides policy makers with a greater flexibility in setting targets in policy formulation. The results indicate that household affordability not only is affected by housing type, but also by the choice of transport modes. Spatial characteristics yield mixed results, suggesting the relationship between affordability and urban form is complex. This study contributes to the growing literature of both transport and housing affordability, particularly in the less explored and distinctive context of Asian cities in the Global South, and has implications for policy in the urban, housing, and transport sectors in Indonesia.

AB  - INTRODUCTION In the development of modern sustainable construction there has been a focus on technological solutions. One of the most effective ways to diminish one's carbon footprint is through reducing residential energy consumption. A simple yet overlooked component of residential energy reduction is to better acclimate people to their local environments. Since the advent of engineered climate control in the mid-20th century, the majority of Americans have "forgotten" how to live with their local climate conditions. This study examines from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives how acclimation via landscape and architecture design interventions can reduce residential energy use. Within a variety of climates in California, it conducts a cost-benefit analysis of reducing enclosed residential square footage to quantify the savings in construction and energy costs. These monies could then be spent on ecologically-appropriate outdoor rooms that fulfill the functional and spatial requirements of the home, requiring little to no extra energy costs. Case studies illustrate a variety of options for the design of the outdoor spaces including: a) multiple spaces around the building for movement with the sun and wind; b) movable controls within a single space such as umbrellas, retractable overhead shade structures, and opening louvered fences for wind; and c) additive devices like fire pits to warm, and water features to cool-all of which would also have aesthetic design qualities. The study highlights not only energy reduction through moving people to comfortable outdoor "rooms," but considers the possibility that outdoor spaces can match the spatial and functional needs of indoor rooms. Additionally, this way of thinking about design improves quality of life for the homeowner by increasing the amount time they spend outside. It weaves together a story of successful design solutions in all climates for true sustainable design.

AB  - In recent years many publications have appeared that stress the sustainable character of vernacular architecture, emphasising its ecological friendliness and appropriateness. Commonly this literature represents vernacular architecture as a more sustainable alternative, or predecessor, to conventional contemporary forms of architecture and their associations with excessive energy consumption, pollution and wasteful use of resources. This article aims to identify what may be learned from this relatively recent work in terms of the way in which it conceptualises and represents vernacular architecture. It reveals a vibrant and growing discourse that makes an important contribution to the field of vernacular architectural studies. It also shows, however, that the relative isolation of the discourse results in a number of short-comings that make our current understanding of the sustainability of vernacular traditions only a partial one. Arguing that the recent discourse replaces the complexity, plurality and dynamics of both vernacular architecture and the concept of sustainability by reductionist, essentialist and romanticist representations, the article calls for a holistic, integrated and critical approach that complements the study of the environmental qualities and performance of vernacular architecture with an examination of its social, political and economic aspects.

AB  - Current research on the housing careers of urban low-income groups, dominated by quantitative modelling, has discussed the housing predicament faced by the urban poor at length. While much is known about the factors influencing their housing careers, these studies have failed to provide a satisfactory understanding of the intricacy and depth of human struggles those vulnerable groups experienced in the urban housing market. This contributes a four-period model, through a dialogue with the established life cycle/life course theories, to the reconceptualization of housing career of the urban poor and depicts a vivid and continuous housing trajectory by analysing their lived experiences at each period. This paper finds that, in a highly constrained and segregated housing market, the housing problems experienced by low-income earners and their coping strategies are far more complex and variegated than traditional life cycle/course theory would predict. Factors at individual, household, community and even national levels are often interwoven and, more importantly, the combinations of these influences are constantly changing, sometimes repeating along their housing career forming a nuanced dynamism that has been largely overlooked by existing research.

AB  - This paper focuses on recent governmental initiatives in Washington, D.C. to bolster the long-term physical and financial viability of its limited-equity cooperative housing stock. Drawing on in-depth interviews with members of the DC Limited Equity Cooperative Taskforce, it interrogates the relationship between recent municipal housing policy and the growing asset-based racial wealth gap. The findings indicate that limited-equity cooperatives provide myriad benefits to their residents, yet ultimately fail to curb systemic limitations on black wealth in the property market and rectify historical patterns of racial disparity in the distribution of governmental resources. This paper argues that policy makers must proactively assess how new models of shared equity homeownership affect or even perpetuate racial disparities in wealth and continuously interrogate the structural impacts of affordable housing policy on the (re)distribution of resources in urban centers.

AB  - An ideal lighting controller should balance between occupant comfort and energy efficiency. In a prior study, we introduced LightLearn, an occupant centered lighting controller based on reinforcement learning and demonstrated its control operation under real conditions in a university building. The controller learned individual occupant preferences and indoor environmental conditions, and adapted its control parameters accordingly by determining personalized set-points. In this paper, we implement a simulation framework to comprehensively evaluate LightLearn. This framework consists of Python and EnergyPlus, and we simulated the performance of LightLearn under various indoor lighting conditions and occupant behaviors. These changes vary the interactions between LightLearn and human input, which effects the performance of the control system. Despite such variations, we show how LightLearn adapts to any indoor light condition and occupant behavior, and determines the optimal policy for balancing occupant comfort and energy efficiency.

AB  - Local demand for houses in Malaysia is different than by the international buyers due to the macroeconomic factors. The growing number of international buyers might also be caused by the liberalization policy in the real estate sector. By acknowledging the possible influence of external investment, the research objective of this study includes foreign direct investment (FDI) as a determinant for housing affordability in Malaysia. This study intends to estimate the long-run effect of FDI and house price on housing affordability by employing the Johansen Cointegration approach. The extension of this study is the inclusion of liberalization using the Channel Method. We observe the impact of liberalization on housing affordability in the presence of FDI. The results of this study i) suggest that liberalization has negatively affected housing affordability; clearly the openness of the real property sector has caused an influx of foreign buyers, pushing house prices beyond the locals' affordability level; and ii) suggest that through FDI, liberalization has changed its sign to positive, signifying the presence of FDI has caused a higher degree of liberalization to influence a higher affordability level. It shows that the openness of the real estate sector has elevated the affordability level among Malaysians for the average house but not for the luxury segment. The results imply that those who benefit from buying luxury houses are not Malaysians. Locals who might previously afford to buy luxury houses were no longer able to do so due to affordability issues. As for financial institutions, unaffordability problem has caused them to offer credit facilities to the locals. Central authorities such as housing ministries are suggested to check whether the luxury segment is largely pushed by locals or foreigners.

AB  - Rising housing costs pose challenges for Canadians trying to form independent households, particularly for those that wish to own their home rather than rent it. This is especially true for immigrants, who have had lower homeownership rates than the Canadian-born since the 1980s. This paper investigates the impacts of housing affordability and the three elements of the housing pathways framework-economic resources, family composition, and cultural variations-on household formation and homeownership differences between five racialized immigrant groups and the Canadian-born. Using Public Use Census data and a "difference in difference" analytical approach, we assess the housing progress of six groups (five foreign-born, one native-born) between 2006 and 2016. We find that housing affordability does not hinder immigrants in forming independent households, suggesting that many immigrants may be willing to earmark a greater share of their incomes to live independently in either rented or owned accommodations. Furthermore, we show that, even after controlling for a range of socioeconomic factors related to housing pathways, residential choices remain largely unexplained, both within and across groups.

For this purpose, we develop a new measure of household overconfidence in the Bayesian framework. For the three variables we test - changes in consumption, stock returns, and changes in human capital, we find that UK households were overconfident about the signals of consumption regardless of regions. However, households in London were overconfident about the signals of stock markets whereas those remote from London were overconfident about the signals of human capital. The results of household overconfidence appear positive in the UK housing market for our sample period from 1980 to 2018, in particular, 0.5% per quarter in London.

AB  - This study examines cash financing transaction price implications over a 12-year United States (U.S.) housing market cycle centred around the 2008 Housing Crisis, a period of unprecedented transaction price volatility. We establish theoretical reasoning and empirical confirmation of the mortgage contingency pricing effect, operationalised as a cash financing discount. We document that cash discounts are associated with market conditions, price levels, and improvement sizes and conditions. Larger empirical cash discounts are related to greater market distress, lower price levels, smaller improvement sizes, and inferior improvement conditions. We conclude that a one-size-fits-all rule-of-thumb is not appropriate when estimating cash financing pricing impacts. Finally, additional research is encouraged across different market conditions and in non-U.S. markets.

AB  - Drawing on qualitative interviews and participatory urban-appraisal tools, this paper analyzes household perceptions on the five elements of Lawrence and Su-Yeul's market-led pluralism (M-LP) framework (2008). It uses post-Fordist Columbus, Ohio, and Fordist Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as testing grounds for these household perspectives. M-LP suggests that at the center of contemporary housing market lie five elements: developers/builders who unveil new urban spaces with culturally open communities; lending agencies that offer affordable mortgages to all; real estate brokers/agents who have moved past discriminatory practices; consumers whose preferences emphasize class-type elements; and communities that impose development agendas. While many felt that the housing market of the mid-2000s was racially blind, race still played a crucial role in driving home-buying decisions, especially in Milwaukee. Columbus respondents aligned more closely with M-LP, putting greater emphasis on class, but they also used phrases and words to blur race and class distinction. Both metropolises, though, illustrated complex intertwining between class and culture.

AB  - Adequate housing is critical for low-income older adults, who face affordability and accessibility challenges that affect their quality of life, health, and ability to live independently in their communities. This article examines the federal policy role in meeting the housing and housing-related needs of the low-income elderly population, which is expected to grow as a proportion of all older adults over the next two decades. The availability of publicly subsidized units and vouchers is woefully inadequate to assist the current low-income elderly population in need of rental assistance. While access to affordable and accessible housing options has been a growing challenge for several decades, the Trump administration and Republican-majority Congress has an agenda and specific budgetary, administrative, and legislative proposals that would worsen the housing situation today and into the future. Population aging combined with a lack of investment in affordable senior housing and related programs over the last two decades requires a call to action for stakeholders in the public and private sectors to jointly develop a comprehensive national senior housing policy agenda and implementation strategy.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the field experts' perspectives on heat emission in sustainable building design and to establish heat emission-focused design criteria for the early building design process based on the expert survey, including scholars and practitioners. 10 design variables were selected from the literature reviews which were verified to have a significant impact on energy consumption. Based on these variables, the expert survey was developed, including 5 sections of 17 questions, and was distributed to the field experts. In the survey, the experts evaluated the importance of 10 design variables based on their experience and background. The survey highlighted the top 90th percentile of the design variables for each energy consumption and heat emission ranked by the participants. For energy consumption, the scholars highlighted roof, wall R-Value, window U-value, and window-to-wall ratio (WWR), while practitioners have highlighted WWR. For heat emission, the scholars have highlighted only wall and roof reflectivity, while the practitioners have highlighted WWR. The results also showed the different opinions by the participants' experiences (more than 5 years vs. less than 5 years) as well as the location, such as North America vs the Middle East. To include these design variables in the design process, the participants asked for their suggestions and recommendations based on a list of 12 answers. The scholar opts for developing a simulation tool to explore multiple design alternatives quickly regarding heat emission, while practitioners prefer to define the most influential design parameters and their sensitivity range.

AB  - This paper examines the health consequence of rising housing prices in China by exploiting spatial and temporal variation in housing price appreciation linked to individual-level health data from 2000 to 2011. Using an instrumental variable approach, we find that in- creases in housing prices significantly raise the probability of having chronic diseases. The deep-rooted marriage culture of males being obligated to buy a home before getting married and the growing marriage market competition are the main channels that exacerbate the negative health effects, particularly for parents with marriage-age sons. We also show that increased work intensity, high levels of stress, and lifestyle changes are other possible channels. Our results highlight the unintended health consequences of the real estate market prosperity. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Planned estates may be a solution to housing demand and affordability in high growth regions. As a result, planned estate research has tended to focus on privatisation, social engineering of communities by developers, and social polarisation. Heatwave research has focused on measuring and mitigating the impact of such events on disadvantaged communities. However, these two research streams have not been combined to examine how planned estate residents may be vulnerable to heatwaves. We address that gap by considering past, current, and future heatwave impacts; identifying underlying processes governing the vulnerability of planned estates to heatwaves; and reflecting on the implications for the sustainability of planned estates in relation to future heatwave risk. We adopt a mixed-methods approach using the case of the Jordan Springs estate in Western Sydney, Australia, and that work is underpinned by systems approaches embedded in sustainability science. We find that Jordan Springs is physically vulnerable to heatwaves due to characteristics in its built environment. Human vulnerability is complex: rooted in multiscalar socio-economic and systemic processes both internal and external to the estate. We suggest resilience be increased to improve estate liveability and sustainability by retrofitting the built environment, improving urban greening, broadening consumer awareness, and modifying development processes.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present a part of the research developed inside the author's dissertation topic which deals with the future of large modernist housing estates. The central question of the dissertation investigates which of the currently dominating tendencies - their replacement or refurbishment - result in lower energy consumption and provides more sustainable use of natural resources within the context of future urban densification. The presented workflow combines actions contained in the first step of the research methodology built around the abovementioned dilemma. It explores the solar energy harvesting potential of various urban forms and densification scenarios, proposed inside the main "refurbishment" and "replacement" approaches, including both retain and demolition options of the existing building stock located in the Nordweststadt housing estate in Frankfurt, Germany. All scenarios are tested against maximal density rate which secures enough operational energy from on-site renewable energy sources for the achievement of the zero energy building (ZEB) standard. The expected outcome of this paper gives an insight which of the proposed densification scenarios from both approaches generate the highest density rate in respect to the given boundary conditions, and compares the energy balance between the best performing scenarios in both approaches at the same density level.

AB  - The sustainability transformation calls for policies that consider the global consequences of local lifestyles. We used stakeholders' visions of sustainable lifestyles across Europe to build 19 scenarios of sufficiency (net reductions) and 17 of green consumption (shift in consumption patterns). We applied Environmentally Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output analysis to model scenarios by assuming widespread adoption of the proposed lifestyles changes. Finally, we estimated the domestic and foreign implications for land, water, carbon and human toxicity potential. We distinguish the options with most potential from those that are seemingly fruitless or present backfire risks. While our method allows for testing a large number scenarios under a consistent framework, further work is needed to add robustness to the scenarios. However, we do find a range of indicative results that have strong potential to contribute to mitigation efforts. Services: We find that a local and sharing service economy has a maximum reduction potential of 18% of the European carbon footprint (CF). Clothing & Appliances: Sharing and extending lifetimes of clothes and devices could diminish CF by approximately 3%. Transport: Reducing motorized transport by remote work and active travel could mitigate between 9 and 26% of CF. Food: Vegan diets could spare 4% of the land and reduce up to 14% of CF. Bio-economy: Switching to biomaterials and bioenergy tend to reduce carbon and toxic emissions at the risk of increasing water and land use. Housing: Passive housing and decentralized renewable energy reduces carbon emissions up to 5 and 14%, respectively. We characterize the sensitivity of our results by modelling income rebound effects and confirm the importance of deterring expenditure in resource intensive goods.

The wind pressure and speed indicators were measured by ANSYS Fluent software, using standard k-epsilon model. The results showed that two factors with the most effect on wind pressure difference were urban block height and widths of adjunct roads. As a result, natural ventilation and consequently energy consumption were affected. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a paucity of reliable estimates for the impact of tax changes on household mobility. We utilize a state mandated school finance reform and temporal differences in vacation home densities to provide a unique test of this fundamental Tiebout assumption. The results show that changes in property taxes explain a significant amount of the variation in vacation home growth; a 3-4 mil decrease in property tax rates is associated with an increase of approximately one vacation home per square kilometer.

AB  - The ecodesign methodologies in the design stage enable buildings to be adapted to the needs of users and deconstructed at the end-of-life. Although ecodesign methods incorporate circular economy (CE) principles, they are little explored in projects and constructions. This study analyses how the construction sector approaches ecodesign methods to achieve buildings' deconstruction. Through an integrative literature review, 288 articles were threefold analyzed: (i) bibliometric, (ii) conceptually about ecodesign methods, and (iii) categorically. The results showed a lack of understanding about the ecodesign concepts, and an integrated methodology was proposed. The most inclusive and sustainable ecodesign method for buildings deconstruction was Design for Adaptability and Disassembly (DfAD). The review shows the concentration of the studies in three categories and a framework was created relating DfAD strategies. The sector needs more information on ecodesign methods, deconstruction strategies, reusing of materials, and in the life cycle tools as decision support to make sustainable buildings.(c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Historic preservation contributes greatly to housing and economic development. Historic preservation has produced almost 250,000 housing units through use of the federal historic rehabilitation tax credit. Additionally, heritage tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry, and preservation projects help further community revitalization. Historic preservation also has a downside. Preservation's growing popularity may dilute its imperative and market prowess, and some argue it is used to thwart new development. Preservation requirements may impede affordable housing production and displace area residents. These undesirable consequences are not givens, however. Preservationists are working to become more flexible, and we suggest ways to practice historic preservation while mitigating some of its negative consequences-for example, tax credit changes, more flexible building codes, and a "tiered" system of designating historic properties at varying levels of significance.

AB  - This article deals with the changes in the tenant profile of the social rented stock in the Netherlands. It is inspired by the question whether the sector may be subject to a residualisation trend. The wider importance of such a phenomenon is that of the social marginalisation of the people concerned in general. Moreover, if the position of the social rented stock can be shown to be deteriorating, it would also illustrate a tendency to social polarisation in the redefined welfare state. Social and income polarisation in Western societies has been extensively investigated but, so far, polarisation tendencies in housing have largely been ignored. This article seeks to show that this omission should be rectified because changes in tenant profiles reveal wider developments. It also aims to uncover the impact of policy in this respect. The analysis of the changing position of the social rented sector during the period leading up to and following the housing policy reform of 1989 constitutes the core of the paper. The aim of that policy change was to improve the match between the tenants' ability to pay and the cost of housing as a means of reducing the burden of rent subsidies on the state. The reform has been hailed as an example of the effectiveness of policy-making. However, the analysis shows that the role of the social rented sector had already been shifting during the 1980s, well before the announcement of the overhaul of housing policy. This result illustrates that policy may simply codify decisions made in a network of actors rather than initiate change on its own accord.

The objective of this paper is to perform an environmental cost-benefit analysis of a sustainable architecture deployment, as a case study considering the construction of the Municipal Secretary of Environment, Science and Technology (SEMACT) of Palmas city - TO. By the private (discount rate of 15% per year) and public criteria (discount rate of 6% per year) for the analysis of investments in the case studied the use of sustainable architecture is not recommended, because the incremental costs of construction are higher than considered benefits (energy saving). Moreover, considering the criterion of sustainability analysis of investments (zero discount rate), the use of sustainable architecture would be relatively attractive. However, the use of this criterion has many restrictions on economic analysis, only recommended in extreme situations where environmental externalities generated by the ventures are intense and not obtained from similar sources or substitutes.

AB  - Design of building structures has been increasingly challenging because height, appearance and function of the buildings are being pushed to achieve a higher limit to demonstrate their unique identity among the others. Reviewing past experience in building design, it has been, however, noted that conventional design method sometimes has limitation in satisfying all kinds of serviceability performances of building structures but increase of building stiffness by enlargement of structural members seems to be the only solution. This paper introduces the research studies and application of control technology blended in some building projects in the aspects of wind engineering and vibration control. An urban redevelopment project in Hong Kong will be one of the example projects discussed. A methodology, namely linear-mode-shape (LMS) method, in wind analysis to the conventional wind tunnel study has been conducted in this project to provide reasonable estimation towards wind-induced responses of building. The application of tuned liquid damper (TLD) to improve building performance in terms of occupant comfort is also highlight of this project being discussed. Other vibration issues related to seismic events in will be another focus of this paper. Control devices of viscous damper and high hardness visco-elastic damper for enhancement of seismic performance of building structures are the examples introduced.

Focusing mainly on English suburban conservation areas, it explores the background to the movement, the views of residents and the range of town-planning systems used in such attempts to retain the 'character and appearance' of these areas. Concepts of, and approaches to, urban landscapes that might be familiar to urban geographers are conspicuous by their absence. A range of tensions are explored, including those generated between residents and professionals, the values and attitudes of the professionals and the likely future conflict over values and attitudes in conservation versus change: the application of concepts of sustainability, including 'densification' and the compact city.

AB  - Given the tense situation in many metropolitan housing markets, concerns have arisen about tenants being displaced from their homes. The debate not only focuses on the number of people obliged to move, but also on the challenges and burdens it entails and, above all, where it leads them. Empirical, notably quantitative, findings on these questions, however, are rare. This article presents such findings for the German capital. These are based on a representative survey on moves between 2013 and 2015 and show that the majority of displaced tenants strive to find a new fiat near their old one and for the most part succeed. It also shows that they have to make a much greater effort to find a new flat than those who have not been displaced. A detailed, spatially explicit analysis of where respondents moved to also indicates that some displaced tenants feel forced to move to locations not of their preference, including the outskirts of the city. That said, this only affected a comparatively small proportion of displaced tenants, at least in the period under review. It can be assumed, nonetheless, that with the further tightening of Berlin's housing market in recent years, the problem of displacement to specific areas of the city is gaining substantial significance. In addition, there is evidence of exclusionary displacement, although this phenomenon was not the focus of the study: Low-income households in search of housing are excluded from certain urban areas in Berlin due to high asking rents.

AB  - The circumstances that produce architecture have profoundly changed and, among these, precisely those which perceive and use space-time in a different way in comparison with the past. This paper defines a conceptual reference framework by positioning the time factor in relation to the role of the project as an innovative and operational procedural tool in terms of sustainable conversion of cities. The essay aims to investigate the "addition strategy" as a paradigm of architectural grafting to achieve a balanced relationship between temporariness and permanence. It outlines scenarios in which a new design culture is capable of guiding the processes of transformation of the built environment by placing the idea of impermanence in a perspective that is closer to the current socio-technical condition.

AB  - The increasingly pressing environmental challenges that govern us entails a necessary questioning of the role of architecture in a viable development of the built environment as a whole. Leading economic and environmental research points to the fact that an addressing of these challenges calls for holistic design approaches as expressed in the concept 'circular economy'. Within architectural research, this concept has recently been associated with a tectonic practice that inscribes future architectural construction in a mutual and ecological cohesion with its past. Present paper continues this research effort by studying the implications and potentials hereof from the point of view of architectural education. This by proposing a link between the presence of tectonic thinking in architecture and the pedagogical challenge of sustaining architectural knowledge over time. The work of Fernando Tavora, who conceived of the architect as a lifelong pupil and educator, serves as a case study investigating this link.

AB  - Due to global warming and energy exhaustion, building retrofitting has attracted increasing attention worldwide. With 67.1 billion square meters of existing building area, China normally targets separate defect remedies to improve building energy efficiency in conventional renovation practices rather than taking a holistic approach to optimize whole building performance. This article presents a working procedure that is employed in the decision-making process of domestic retrofits in Chins from an architect's perspective, combining building-sculpt redesign with the overall performance targets. This study examines three representative residences of different ages and dimensions as case studies to demonstrate a simulation-based holistic approach of integrating form, fabric and system strategies to improve environmental performance and reduce house-hold energy consumption without compromising building aesthetics in retrofit design. Different retrofit routes and corresponding priorities should be applied towards different conditions for different purposes. The simulation results indicate that within the service life, the older the residence, the greater the retrofit potential. For the 1981 residence, a holistic approach could achieve an energy savings of 78.1% and a CO2 savings of 92.6%. For the 1995 case, the holistic approach could reduce energy consumption by 66.6% and CO2 emissions by 76.6%. When designed properly, a 36.9% reduction in energy consumption and a 44.6% reduction in CO2 emissions could be achieved for the 2002 residence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The legacy of built heritage is one of the most critical questions of our time-the objective of preserving its immaterial values and exploiting its original vocation brings about challenges related to the history, the identity, and the quality of life of the concerned territory. This especially applies to religious buildings given their strong bond with collective memory. The aim of this research is to determine whether allocating new uses that pursuit social benefits for the community is a possible implementation of the aforementioned purposes and whether it better addresses a broader view of sustainable development, which encompasses equity and well-being. The methodology combines careful knowledge of the building, comparing residual performances of the fabric with new functions. We present a case study, with focus on healthcare-related accommodation facilities and the issue of healthcare migration, which aims to convert a dismissed capuchin convent, located in Villagonia (Taormina, Italy), into a shelter house to host families whose relatives are being treated at the neighbourhood medical centre. This proposal shows that heritage buildings, especially religious ones, have outstanding material and immaterial potential and, through good reuse practices, they provide a valuable opportunity to address the overarching objective of social sustainability.

AB  - Given the contemporary scenario, which seeks to have a careful look at the environment, Sao Paulo's architecture could think of changes that contribute to the goals stablished by the Paris Agreement (climate change, 2015) and the 2030 Agenda (sustainable development, 2015). In this context, the hospital building stands out for its operating complexity, with a great impact on the environment and resource consumption. The objective of this article is to present and reflect on innovations with sustainability, incorporated in the Oswaldo Cruz German Hospital (HAOC), in the city of Sao Paulo. Considering this demand for sustainability, the hospital announces its commitment in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), as well as proposes into achieve important certifications in the market, such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) in search for better results of performance. The work analyzes the performance of the hospital in the face of the of sustainability challenge, based on bibliographic material on the environmental and contemporary sustainable architecture; booklets and reports published by HAOC to collect data, photos and record the interventions performed at the hospital. The article also analyzes the adherence of HAOC's actions to in reference to the goals of the Paris Agreement and assesses whether its contribution with environment-friendly results because of the complex's architectural scenario.

AB  - Environmental consideration within the Swedish construction sector can no longer be considered marginal. It is here discussed whether the same commitment is extended to facilitate deeper dimensions of sustainability in the provision of housing, beyond simply energy-efficient residential buildings? The paper presents the case of a multi-family 'green' residential area being developed in Goteborg, Sweden. An interview study with the seven housing developers building in the area provides primary empirical insights, further complemented by findings from a workshop with architects involved in the project. Conceptualizations of sustainability in housing are explored, based in discourses among these market actors. Issues identified in the inductive data analysis relate to the ambitions set and measures taken in new 'green' building, as well as market perceptions of housing standards, lifestyles and household configurations that are reproduced in the built environment. The paper shows that interpretations of sustainability in market-led housing development do not radically challenge the normative and resource intense contemporary ideals surrounding the urban home and that the realization of goals undertaken in the case of Kvillebacken is generally dependent on economic considerations and market assessments. In conclusion, the paper emphasizes the need to formulate an integrative approach to more holistic sustainable residential environments.

AB  - The OEDC has estimated that buildings today account for over 40% of energy consumption in the world, and are responsible for about 45% of all carbon emissions, 40% of all freshwater consumption, 70% of all timber consumption, 50% of world's material consumption and are responsible for 40% of all human-produced waste (OECD 1999). However, this quantity of energy consumed can be greater in more industrialized countries due to their energy needs, while the proportion of energy usage by buildings in developing countries is comparatively higher due to inefficiency of systems and is more significant than the developed countries due to prevailing extreme shortage of energy. The building sector consumes more than 43% of total energy produced within Pakistan while 10% is used for manufacturing and transportation of building components & materials (World Resources Institute. 2007). It is a matter of common experience that a large majority of new buildings constructed in Pakistan are not designed in accordance with local climatic conditions. Excessive use of concrete and glass, high levels of illumination and heavy reliance on space conditioning are common feature of our buildings. This means that owners and occupants consume extra energy to make them comfortable for living. ENERCON has estimated that improved building design can reduce building energy bills by 20% and this figure can be raised to 50% by use of efficient appliances (ENERCON2008). Energy Efficient Sustainable Buildings where at one hand can reduce the energy burden, on other can avoid global warming, improve local air quality, retard global climate change and save consumers money. The choices we make in designing and constructing new buildings (and renovating old ones) will impact the global climate directly..

AB  - A mother of a nine-year-old boy says .... "Monday, I do carpool duty and so I have to drive into Burbank. I pick up my [age 11] son at 1:00, then we dash over to Burbank and pick up 6 kids and they all get off at different times. Even on days that it's not my carpool day, I still have an hour and fifteen minutes drive to pick up my son. Some days it's really hectic. There are days when I have a night class, so we stop and get dinner on the way home, but that's only one day a week. Then, we do homework, I get the kids bathed and in bed. And we found a new, more appropriate school for [my daughter]. We have all impossible schedule. We had to reshuffle our whole lives. We had to give up a lot to have her go to this school, but I felt like for years we'd given up so much to take care of my son's therapy and she [the older sister] was miserable. I thought we've got to try something else. Every once in a while, I get really tired of the 2 hour drive, and then my daughter will say 'Please, I'll do anything, don't pull me from the school. I've never been happier in my life.' Well, as a result, I get tip at 4:30 in the morning, and then I don't get to bed until after midnight. We probably have the worst life of all the parents in your study. We are going to die young. As far as sleep, we don't sleep. We exist. I'm lucky, because I'm kind of a night person, but we tend to get sick easily."

AB  - Bangladesh, a low-income country, experiences an unsatisfactory situation in urban housing. Improvement in the situation is constrained by a number of factors, such as rapid population growth, an inequitable social structure, poor economy and persisting poverty, an ineffective public policy and a hostile natural environment. In sustainability terms, rapid urbanisation and large-scale demands for housing in urban areas may pose some problems for ecological sustainability. There are also conflicting and competitive issues in technological and economic sustainability versus cultural and social sustainability. The provision of easy access to housing finance, in the model of Grameen Bank's housing credit, access to land, realistic building standards and access to affordable building materials along with community involvement are some of the options towards achieving a sustainable housing policy in Bangladesh. At the same time strong political commitment and a stable political environment are recognised as preconditions to sustainable urban housing. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The criteria on green public procurement of the European Union establish that the economic budgets of building projects must be complemented by their derived environmental and social costs. These criteria are currently being adapted to the requirements related to the circular economy, such as the use of methods to evaluate buildings environmentally. However, most methods available in the European and Spanish markets require prior training, which makes their use difficult. This paper presents an evaluation method, CEACE, for housing construction based on the determination of their footprints (ecological, carbon, and water footprints), also called the footprint family, to which the economic and social evaluation is added, as is the quantification of the construction and demolition waste generated. This method is validated with the assessment of fifteen residential buildings in Andalusia and creates an indicator that will allow technicians, companies, and administrations to evaluate projects in accordance with the criteria of green public procurement. The method is sensitive to changes in the type of building, foundation solution, and underground construction.

AB  - Built Environment has significant impact on natural environment and construction industry plays a vital role in sustainability assessment. Assessing the overall energy impact during pre-use phases of a building has been neglected at large. Three critical attributes namely; Construction materials, embodied energy and global warming interact with each other resulting in a complex interaction phenomena. This phenomenon can be simplified as: I-1-Interaction between Construction Materials and Embodied Energy; I-2-Embodied Energy and Global Warming; I-3-Global warming and Construction materials. The three interactions result in the net outcome of a Sustainability Development Index (SDI). A new SDI is presented using the concept of Figure of Merit (FoM). This is an exclusive non dimensional parameter, accounting for two engineering properties viz., modulus of elasticity and density, and two construction industry cost stimulants. The proposed SDI model is a comprehensive energy assessment model that integrates FoM with other energy indicators and allows expressing sustainability level of a building in percentage. SDI model discussed here is a preventive approach rather than curative approach and can be applied to all building typologies. Case Study Project (CSP) undertaken is found to have a sustainability level of 56.25% compared to a benchmark project whose low energy values are considered as base values. The investigation also indicates that SDI percentage is conservative by about 10% as compared to sustainability level computed using embodied energy analysis. Prior knowledge about building's sustainability level during pre-use stage helps in adopting strategies to reduce global warming using alternative materials and technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This review paper studies the differences in the energy use behaviour in households in developing and developed countries, by focus on a geographically diverse selection of publications. The study has been divided into sections in which energy use, socio-economic factors, policies and the methods used in the surveys have been investigated. The main motivation of the study was to understand user behavioural patterns influencing energy consumption (or reduction in use), and the effect of varying socio-demographic factors on the same. The methodologies adopted in the papers reviewed have been compared. Surveys were prioritized in the examined papers to see if there was an pattern in household energy use and which behaviours affected this. For the developing countries door knocking were the most used strategy to get hold of information. For the developed countries surveys online were the most effective strategy. In Japan and Norway clear differences could be seen due to the culture of the countries, which affected the households energy use. For the developing countries energy here is not predominantly electricity. Biofuels and kerosene were the most common fuels used for the daily life of the residents in the developing countries. A transition from these fuels to more modern energy is happening right now in the 21st century. The government have a big impact on the households energy use and the governments for the different countries prioritize differently as seen in Kuwait where they subsidy 90 % of the final electricity for the households thus increases the energy use significantly which have a negative sustainable development effect. While on the other hand the government in Zambia decided to shut down the whole electricity grid for eight hours per day during a two year period of time to save energy. Effective strategies for reducing energy use, according to most of the publications, are tailor-made information and feedback to users, and clear outlining of goals by the decision-makers, for both the developed countries and the developing countries. Future research should focus on effective formulation of the feedback provided to users.

AB  - In recent years, a lot of empirical effort has been made to search for potential nonlinear responses of house prices to various demand and supply factors. This paper examines Poland's heterogeneous regional housing market reactions to key economic variables from 2000 to 2022. The study raises two research questions related to the asymmetric adjustment of housing markets to selected demand and supply shocks.Firstly, we ask whether the house price adjustments to negative shocks are relatively minor (for example, during an economic downturn) when compared to positive shocks (prevalent in booming markets), mainly due to the loss aversion behavior theory and nominal rigidity of house prices. In particular, we test the hypothesis that house prices react more to positive impulses from supply and demand than negative ones.Secondly, we investigate whether market reactions are similar for large and small metropolitan markets. The second hypothesis posits that metropolitan housing markets adjust asymmetrically to demand and supply shocks based on the city size (population and housing stock in a given city).The study uses a nonlinear ARDL model to test the research hypotheses empirically. This paper provides new insights into the nonlinear reactions of house prices to exogenous shocks and adds to the limited empirical evidence from less developed economies.

AB  - This study presented a methodology and process to establish a passive level for policy making of building energy in South Korea. A passive level in Korea specified in the 2017 Roadmap for non-residential buildings, which was 15 kWh/m(2).year, was defined as the heating energy requirement to strengthen the building energy saving design standards, which were typical building energy regulations in Korea. This study also presented insulation standards of roofs, floors, outer walls, and windows in Pyeongchang, Seoul, Gwangju, and Jeju, which were represented cities of four zones in Korea (Middle 1, Middle 2, Southern, and Jeju). Furthermore, the study results were extended to 66 cities around the nation to calculate the heating energy requirements and a severely cold region was added to existing three regions (Middle, Southern, and Jeju) to extend this to four regions (Middle 1, Middle 2, Southern, and Jeju). Afterwards, insulation standards for four represented regions were presented to derive a measure that minimized an energy loss through outer walls or windows in buildings. Finally, this study derived that a return of investment can be achieved in 10 years, which was determined through the comprehensive economic feasibility analysis due to strengthening insulation performances, proving the rationalization of the legal strengthening.

AB  - In this study, 112 traditional villages in volcanic areas of Hainan Province were investigated. The field investigation, spatial analysis, statistics and comparative study on the traditional villages and vernacular dwellings in Hainan volcanic areas were performed. Based on the theory of ecological adaptability, the layout of traditional villages and the types, distribution and differences of vernacular dwellings in Hainan volcanic areas were studied from the perspective of village layout structure, architectural space form and construction mode. It is found that the natural environment, architectural functions, customs, national culture and other aspects are the fundamental reasons for the formation and differences of buildings. The ecological adaptation process of traditional villages includes not only the adaptation of external topography, climate conditions and natural resources, but also the ecological adaptation of internal built environment. Meanwhile, the evolution of traditional villages is closely related to social-ecological adaptation. In addition, the ecological concept and technical experience of the traditional villages in Hainan volcanic areas in adapting to the natural environment and social environment were summarized. This study provides a reference for the protection and renewal of cultural landscape in Hainan volcanic areas.

AB  - This paper introduces a new method water-retaining roof brick to reduce the energy cooling load in meeting people's comfort demands in hot seasons. An experimental model of passive evaporation is designed in order to explore a complete heat transfer process law of water-retaining brick in hot summer and cold winter region. The result of using a flat roof with water-retaining brick shows a drop of 1.9 degrees C in the indoor temperature in summer compared to the base case of the conventional flat roof in residential buildings. In addition, the results indicate the cooling load required for the building will decrease after using water-retaining bricks on roof and also using the radiation shield on roof. The best solution to increase the indoor thermal comfort is water-retaining brick rather than roof with shield, because the evaporation process plays a supporting role to ease the city heat island effect. Thus, it's the most optimal scheme. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

AB  - With income increasing and improvement of living standard, the level of housing demand of consumers is also rising. In the past years, real estate housing market of our country is developing in the favorable market environment; development demonstrates a block of prosperous scenes at a full speed. So a large number of Chinese and foreign real estate companies enter rapidly in Chinese real estate market. To adapt to the increasingly market competition and improve competition of real estate enterprises, corporations should make investigation on the market and to carry out real estate marketing strategies, in view of this question, firstly real estate company need to make marketing segmentation. In this study used the theory of market segmentation and attitude, also explores consumer's attitude toward housing marketing from three components: cognitive, emotion and behavior, and finally done the segmentation of consumers. Based on the results, this study explains the practical and academic implications for real estate companies promoting in Chinese market.

AB  - This study is devoted to studying households' decisions to move and whether to rent or own after moving. It employs dynamic discrete choice models which condition households' decisions on their circumstances at every point in time during the length of the observation while accounting for individual heterogeneity. The results show that key dynamic elements, captured by means of lagged dependent variables, as wed as household heterogeneity, are significant determinants of the tenure choice and mobility decisions. Moreover, homeowners are found to be responsive to housing market conditions when adjusting their housing stock. Housing-price appreciation is found to discourage renters from becoming homeowners. Finally, our results reject the proportional monetary transaction costs specification suggesting that monetary transaction costs might be fixed.

AB  - Implementing low-carbon houses is inseparable from the carbon tax and subsidy policies. Appropriate carbon taxes and subsidies can help to reduce household carbon emissions. This study aims to identify a suitable carbon tax and subsidy policy and investigate how this policy will affect the adoption of low-carbon housing. We classify programs including carbon taxes and subsidies into four categories: static carbon tax static subsidy, static carbon tax dynamic subsidy, dynamic carbon tax dynamic subsidy, and dynamic carbon tax static subsidy. Additionally, under various carbon tax and subsidy systems, the evolutionary stability strategies (ESS) of real estate developers and governments will be examined using evolutionary game theory. The case simulation results show that static carbon tax and dynamic subsidies are the best strategies. Government regulation is essential for the implementation of low-carbon housing. The higher the carbon tax and the property developer's profit, the higher the willingness of property developers to implement low-carbon houses and the higher the willingness of government regulation. Appropriate low-carbon subsidies will help property developers implement low-carbon houses. However, after reaching a certain point, low-carbon subsidies will make property developers less inclined to build low-carbon houses. The higher the cost of government regulation, the lower the probability of the low-carbon strategy of property developers, but the cost of government regulation has little impact on the government's regulation strategy.

AB  - Buildings constructed according to bioclimatic architectural principles in amenable climates have often experienced posterior interventions that have closed ventilation openings for the installation of air conditioning units. The present work sought to investigate the reasons for installing air conditioning equipment in buildings even under adverse economic conditions and with the awareness of their negative environmental implications. The Faculty of Architecture building at the Federal University of Bahia, located in the city of Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil, was the focus of the present investigation. It was determined that the lack of maintenance of the windows and window frames, and the closing of projected openings compromised natural ventilation. The study confirmed the adequacy of the architectural project in relation to the local climate, and in loco measurements likewise confirmed the efficiency of natural ventilation through the windows and other openings in the faculty room and classrooms examined. The results of the interviews concerning thermal comfort indicated that 53% of the users felt comfortable. Nonetheless, it was found that the building's windows and window frames were poorly maintained, compromising their ability to facilitate efficient natural ventilation and significantly diminishing the capacity for thermal regulation in the building. This study calls attention to the necessity of refining and improving the maintenance of university buildings to reduce the intensive use of artificial air conditioning in detriment to investments in projects that could lend priority to natural ventilation and the maintenance of good window operating conditions.

AB  - The housing vacancy rate (HVR) is an important index in assessing the healthiness of residential real estate market. In China, it is hardly to take advantage of the basic data of real estate information due to the opaque of those data. In this paper, the HVR is estimated to two scales. At the grid level, urban area ratio was calculated by nighttime images after eliminating outliers of nighttime images and night light intensity of non-residential pixels in mixed pixels by a proposed modified optimal threshold method, and built-up areas in each pixel were extracted from the land-cover data. Then, the HVR is calculated by comparing the light intensity of specific grid with the light intensity of full occupancy rate regions. At the administrative scale, the GCI ('ghost city' index) is constructed by calculating the ratio of the total light radiation intensity of a city to the total construction land area of the city. The overall spatial differentiation pattern of the vacant houses in the national prefecture level administrative regions is analyzed. The following conclusions were drawn: vacant housing is rare in certain eastern coastal cities and regions in China with relatively fast economic development. Cities based on exhausted resources, some mountainous cities, and cities with relatively backward economic development more typically showed high levels of housing vacancy. The GCI of prefecture-level administrative units gradually declined from north to south, whereas the east-west distribution showed a parabolic shape. As city level decreased, the GCI registered a gradual upward trend. China's urban housing vacancy can be divided into five categories: industry or resources driven, government planned, epitaxy expansionary, environmental constraint and speculative activate by combining the spatial distribution of housing vacancy with the factors of natural environment, social economic development level, and population density into consideration.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the role and significance of European cultural identity in the formation of the urban environment in 19th-century and early-20th-century British Hong Kong. Our purpose is to offer an alternative reading of the social history of Hong Kong-the orthodox accounts of which remain largely predominant in the general historical understanding of that society-by examining the machinations that surrounded attempts by the European colonial elite to control the production of urban form and space in the capital city of Hong Kong, Victoria. Here the European Residential District ordinance of 1888 (along with other related ordinances) is considered in detail. An examination of European cultural self-perception and the construction of colonial identity is made by considering not only the actual ways in which urban form and space were manipulated through these ordinances but also the visual representation of the city in art. Here the intersection between ideas and images concerning civil society, cultural identity, architecture, and the official practices of colonial urban planning is demonstrated. It is argued that this coalescing of ideas, images, and practices in the colonial environment of British Hong Kong not only led to the racialisation of urban form and space there but also contributed to the apparent anxiety exhibited by the European population over the preservation of their own identity through the immediacy of the built environment.

AB  - Space efficiency in North American skyscrapers is crucial due to financial, societal, and ecological reasons. High land prices in major cities require maximizing every square foot for financial viability. Skyscrapers must accommodate growing populations within limited spaces, reducing urban sprawl and its associated issues. Efficient designs also support environmental sustainability and enhance city aesthetics, while optimizing infrastructure and services. However, no comprehensive study has examined the key architectural and structural features impacting the space efficiency of these towers in North America. This paper fills this gap by analyzing data from 31 case study skyscrapers. Findings indicated that (1) central core was frequently employed in the organization of service core; (2) most common forms were setback, prismatic, and tapered configurations; (3) outriggered frame and shear walled frame systems were mostly used; (4) concrete was the material in most cases; and (5) average space efficiency was 76%, and the percentage of core area to gross floor area (GFA) averaged 21%, from the lowest of 62% and 13% to the highest of 84% and 31%. It is expected that this paper will aid architectural and structural designers, and builders involved in shaping skyscrapers in North America.

Numerical methods and 3D simulation software are combined with photo processing methods using digital cameras with special mirrors to project the hemispherical environment onto a circular image. This methodology has been applied to a real case study in Switzerland that is undergoing a very fast urban densification process, where urban planning strategies will determine significantly the possibility to relish solar irradiation in buildings. This paper analyzed the particularities of different urban scenarios considering the effects of urban densification planning strategies on existing buildings, in particular historical protected buildings.

The author offers an in-depth case study following the evolution of an eco-cohousing model from its grassroots origins to its current application in the housing market of Ithaca, New York. Planners used existing planning documents to translate innovative practices to the public, defying assumptions of the rational-linear model still common in planning scholarship.

AB  - This review takes stock of contemporary social science research on homelessness. Research on homelessness in the 1980s has been prompted by the increased numbers and visibility of homeless persons including men, women, and families, as well as young people without families. Most empirical research employs a working definition of homelessness as the condition of those people who are without a permanent place to live. However, a wide range in perspectives differ over what homelessness is. In part, this reflects recognition of some the dynamics of homelessness that include intermittent movement in and out of homeless situations. But it also reflects changes in social values over what constitutes adequate housing. Research shows that the population of homeless persons is diverse, although most homeless persons are young and single. Many have severe chronic problems including mental illness, alcoholism, physical disabilities, and poor health. A significant number have criminal histories. Many were raised in foster care situations. All suffer from economic deprivation, and many have experienced long-term unemployment. Considerable disagreement exists over the number of homeless persons, in part because the scarcity of resources to address this problem politicizes the debate. There is also strong disagreement over the root causes of homelessness. Debate over the causes of homelessness is caught up in whether the focus of research should be on structural forces that permit homelessness to occur or the immediate reasons why people become homeless. Research now suggests that the extreme situation of homelessness may be more accurately portrayed as the result of the convergence of many factors that drive this phenomenon, including housing market dynamics, housing and welfare policy, economic restructuring and the labor market, and personal disabilities. Policies designed to ameliorate homelessness have been inadequate to stem the tidal forces that produce such severe destitution, and this trend is likely to continue. Future important directions include addressing the role of employment and social ties in producing homelessness, comparing the economic and social situation of homeless and non-homeless persons, evaluating programs designed to aid homeless persons, and developing international comparisons of homelessness.

AB  - The rebuilding of deteriorating residential areas is being replicated rapidly throughout Israeli cities despite limited assessment of the social consequences. This paper presents the findings of a social impact assessment (SIA) applied to a demolition and reconstruction case study carried out in a low-income neighborhood in Petah Tikva. The project represents a typical example of developer-led removal of low-rise, mixed tenure housing replaced by privately owned high-rise housing. A mixed-methods approach was used to explore the actual and potential social implications from different points of view held by the various public and private actors in the project. The research was based on the analysis of official documents, field observations, and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders involved in the rebuilding process, and with affected community representatives. The case study was analyzed with regard to three components: the public engagement process, financial well-being, and community cohesion and stability. The assessment revealed insufficient public and municipal involvement, the displacement of the majority of low-income households, disregard for the provision of community infrastructure, and the weakening of community stability. The paper suggests various ways to improve the outcomes of the project for all the affected parties, and argues that incorporating the SIA mechanism in this particular form of urban renewal might improve strategic decision-making and promote urban sustainability.

AB  - The cost-optimal analysis represents a useful tool to stimulate the refurbishment of existing buildings, highlighting the minimal global cost that private or public users have to sustain in order to attain appreciable energy savings in the building life span. The identification of precise interventions on the building plant system could steer legislators to the emanation of appropriate financial incentives in order to make the refurbishment of existing edifices more attractive. However, the cost-optimal solutions cannot be generalized as they are strongly influenced by the initial conditions and by the climatic context. In this paper, a traditional social housing unit, realized in Italy during the 1970s, largely widespread and strongly energy-consuming, was analysed in two different climatic zones belonging to the Italian territory. Suitable interventions were identified for the reduction of energy requirements for heating, cooling and domestic hot water production. These analyses were carried out by using the same simulation tool for energy and economic performances, highlighting the deviances among the cost-optimal solutions, the n-ZEB target and the minimal interventions for the containment of energy consumptions imposed by the current Italian legislation for buildings subjected to refurbishment.

AB  - Social housing in Spain has its origin in the first Cheap Houses Law that was promulgated in 1911, trying to provide a solution to a housing need for the working class who flocked to the cities in waves of migration from rural areas. Since then, legislative initiatives have been taking place to mitigate the housing problem. Each one of them was contributing elements that presumably contributed to the hygiene and habitability of the house without forgetting the economic conditions. At the moment, in Spain there is a large real estate park inherited from these initiatives. In many cases, these are neighborhoods that currently show notable energy and social vulnerability. Aware of the need to adapt these homes to the regulatory requirements related to energy efficiency, comfort and the physical and technical characteristics of the construction, the Research Centers are developing multiple investigations aimed at favoring the adaptability of homes and improving the quality of life of its inhabitants. This article takes a tour of the evolution that social housing has had during the 20th century in Spain and the current state of research aimed at adapting it to the new energy, habitability and sustainability requirements.

AB  - Drawing from ethnographic observations and interview data gathered during 6 months working as a home caregiver at the Pinewood Apartments, a recovery-oriented supported housing community in Texas, I demonstrate how stigma and social defeat were moral and social processes that pervaded life for all involved, including service providers. Yet, because of the extreme power differentials that characterized tenant-staff relationships, the assault of stigma and social defeat was much more frequent, existentially intense, and morally and materially consequential for certain tenants, whose attempts at ideological resistance were delegitimized by service providers, including myself, who were backed by the authority of dominant psychiatric and moralistic discourses concerning the inherent irrationality and irresponsibility of people with severe mental illness. Nevertheless, due to the indeterminate and at times inharmonious nature of moral experience, it is not my intention to portray tenants as wholly defeated. Rather, individual tenants often exhibited defeat and resistance simultaneously.

AB  - This paper examines the extent to which slum redevelopments have been successful in improving the sustainability of human settlements. Sustainability is measured in two ways: through the Extended Metabolism Model that looks at resource consumption, wastes, and liveability outcomes; and, through the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The study compares the sustainability of informal slum settlements in Addis Ababa with high-rise slum clearance apartments; such clearance is the model mostly used for the world's informal settlements. The results show very little difference in resource consumption and waste produced but show liveability outcomes are mixed: Economic benefit is substantially improved in the high-rise areas due to becoming part of the formal economy, but community networks and trust are substantially lost when people transfer from the slums. This paper suggests that slum policy could be shifted from the Modernist high-rise slum clearance approach to a more organic, community-based renewal of the slums themselves in which infrastructure for energy, water, and waste can be brought in. New technology that fits into community-based governance structures allows such infrastructure to be a viable option, as well as enabling formal economic benefits. Some hybrid approaches may be needed in many slum improvement programs.

AB  - This study of 1755 households in Nairobi's slums challenges the conventional belief that slums offer low-quality low-cost shelter to a population that cannot afford better standards. In Nairobi, slums provide low-quality but high-cost shelter. Although slum residents pay millions of dollars in rents annually, and better quality units command higher rents, very little is being re-invested to upgrade quality. To resolve the challenge that the Nairobi puzzle poses for theory and practice, we develop a new analytical framework for understanding quality of living conditions. Improving conditions in Nairobi's slums requires, we argue, two simultaneous interventions: alteration of the tenure mix to enhance owner occupancy and infrastructure investment.

AB  - Singapore has developed its own unique state-driven housing system, with more than three quarters of its housing stock built by the Housing and Development Board and homeownership financed through Central Provident Fund savings. As a result, it has one of the highest homeownership rates amongst market economies. This paper provides a historical perspective of the main housing problems faced by successive prime ministers and their respective policy responses. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew (1959-1990), the government established an integrated landhousing supply and housing finance framework to channel much needed resources into the housing sector to deal with a chronic housing shortage. Under Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong (1990-2004), asset enhancement schemes to renew aging estates as well as market deregulation measures were implemented. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (2004-present) has been confronted with a different set of challenges - investment demand for housing, rising inequalities and rapidly aging population. These problems have brought about the introduction of carefully crafted macroprudential policies, targeted housing grants to assist low and middle income households, and schemes to help elderly households monetize their housing equity.

AB  - The housing problem is an important issue concerning the people livelihood. However China's housing prices remain high, and the low - income groups still face the predicament of housing difficulties and even inability of house affording. In comparison, there is a big gap between Singapore's housing concept of "shelter for all" and China's housing reality. Residence is an important component of civil rights and it is the government's duty to ensure the people who can not afford housing have room to live in. In order to solve the housing problems of low - income families, our government has increased the construction of affordable housing. However there are still many difficulties and challenges in the process of affordable housing supplies. From this sense, some successful experience can he learned from the "Home Ownership Scheme" of Singapore's housing security system, and in this paper, practical policy recommendations for the improvement ofChina' housing security system are proposed.

AB  - As Beijing becomes a modern yet more populated city, people now are faced with an increasing number of choices when they want to purchase commercial building. Beside from apartment price, location and other factors, building room structure has always been a major determinant for apartment buyers. Traditionally, when it comes to the room structure people will mainly focus on space-sufficiency as well as convenience. This paper tries to explore the importance of the building room structure in terms of energy saving and energy saving ratio. The differences of various types of building structures are mainly about space allocation of different rooms and directions each window or door is facing. Such difference will lead to the variation of the level of natural ventilation. Besides, natural ventilation is the most common way to provide fresh air to indoor environment. To study the difference of natural ventilation for different room structures, this paper focuses on three most common room structures with the same building outer design. The changes will only be made on the location of different rooms in a household and the orientation of each room's door, window etc. By using CFD simulation software, the first simulation will be about the external wind field of the building and to get the tuyere air pressure. Then DeST-VENT+, a software developed by Tsinghua University specified for building environment design simulation, is used to calculate the cooling and heating load for the building. After that a thorough comparison between different room structures and building load is made. Finally, we can find that the influences room structure has on building energy saving ratio cannot be ignored and ventilation demand and ventilating ability are two main factors when we analyse energy-saving ratio.

AB  - In an ideal world, occupants have an understanding of how building systems work and are motivated to use the systems as they were designed to be. There is considerable evidence, however, that occupants do not understand the principles of how buildings function and that they use the systems non-optimally. The purpose of the paper is to quantify the effect of occupant behaviour on energy consumption and show how it is affected by design strategies. Numerical simulations of an office were performed with the dynamic thermal simulation software TRNSYS. Three types of behaviour ('careless', 'normal', and 'conscious') and two types of design ('ordinary' and 'robust') were considered. The results show that the effect of occupant behaviour on energy consumption is greatly diminished with robust design solutions, solutions that make buildings less sensitive to occupant behaviour. The careless user consumes 75-79 % less energy if the robust design solutions are applied rather than the ordinary design solutions. It is argued that a realistic view of occupant behaviour is advantageous in the creation of energy-efficient buildings (that is, leaving less need to learn how buildings work, to be motivated to save energy, or to perform specific energy-saving actions). However, the possibility of personal control should not be eliminated.

AB  - The increasing mobility of people, capital and information, combined with the new technological tools provided by the internet, lie behind the touristification of the cities which has been associated with important dynamics of urban rehabilitation and cultural valorization. Public policies facilitate these processes that are dependent on international investment that chooses some privileged locations to accumulate capital. There is a lot of controversy and reaction from the local people about the effects of new real estate products such as short-term rentals in the historic city due to restrictions on access to housing. The paper analyses this process in Lisbon, with two lines of reasoning: the theory of the circulation of capital between accumulation circuits and across geographical space; and the role of public policy attracting visitors and investment towards real estate and urban regeneration.

AB  - Individuals participating in the HUD Housing Choice Voucher program, formerly Section 8, can rent units in the private market and are not tied to public housing projects in a specific neighborhood. We would expect vouchers to help poor families leave the ghetto and move to more diverse communities with higher socioeconomic opportunity, but many voucher holders remain concentrated in poor, segregated communities. We use longitudinal qualitative data from one hundred low-income African American families in Mobile, Alabama, to explore this phenomenon, finding that tenants' limited housing search resources, involuntary mobility, landlord practices, and several aspects of the voucher program itself limit families' ability to escape disadvantaged areas. We also find that the voucher program's regulations and funding structures do not incentivize housing authorities to promote neighborhood mobility and residential choice. This combination of forces often keeps voucher recipients in neighborhoods with high concentrations of poor and minority residents.

AB  - Purpose This paper intends to review and assess the factors influencing adaptive reuse of commercial projects, throughout their life cycle, in Saudi Arabia. Design/methodology/approach A mixed approach of literature review, pilot-testing and questionnaire survey was utilized to identify and assess the factors affecting adaptive reuse of commercial projects. Thirty-eight factors were identified and categorized under four groups, corresponding to the key phases of the project life cycle. The questionnaire survey was administered to a targeted group of 90 architecture/engineering, construction and facilities management (AEC/FM) practitioners of building adaptive reuse, in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The relative importance index (RII) for each factor was calculated. Three levels of agreement, based on the ranking of the factors, among the respondents were determined. Findings The most important factors affecting adaptive reuse of commercial projects are: structural integrity of the building, municipal approval for the land use change, enforcement of safety procedures at the project site, compliance with health and safety measures and accuracy and completeness of the contract documents. A high level of agreement was observed among the three groups of respondents, on the ranking of the factors. Originality/value This research expands the body of knowledge, through providing AEC/FM practitioners, with the type, importance and ranking of the influential factors on adaptive reuse of commercial projects, throughout their life cycle.

AB  - According to the Circularity Gap Report 2020, a mere 8.6% of the global economy was circular in 2019. The Global Status Report 2018 declares that building construction and operations accounted for 36% of global final energy use and 39% of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Paris Agreement demands that the building and construction sector decarbonizes globally by 2050. This requires strategies that minimize the environmental impact of buildings and practices extending the lifecycle of their constituents within a circular resource flow. To ensure that effective measures are applied, a suitable method is needed to assess compliance in materials, processes, and design strategies within circular economy principles. The study's assumption is that synthetic and reliable indicators for that purpose could be based on reversibility and durability features. The paper provides an overview of building design issues within the circular economy perspective, highlighting the difficulty in finding circular technologies which are suitable to enhance buildings' service life while closing material loops. The results identify reversibility and durability as potential indicators for assessing circular building technologies. The next research stage aims to further develop the rating of circularity requirements for both building technologies and entire buildings.

AB  - Post-disaster reconnaissance is vital for assessing the impact of a natural disaster on the built environment and informing improvements in design, construction, risk mitigation, and our understanding of extreme events. The data obtained from reconnaissance can also be utilized to improve disaster recovery planning by maximizing resource efficiency, minimizing waste, and promoting resilience in future disasters. This paper aims to investigate existing reconnaissance reports and datasets to identify the factors that impact the reusability of buildings post-disaster and to recommend strategies that align with circular economy goals. The study adopted a three-step research methodology to attain the proposed goals: (1) thematic analysis was used to evaluate types of damages reported in the reconnaissance reports; (2) a supervised machine-learning algorithm was employed to analyze reconnaissance datasets; and (3) a concept map was developed based on interviews of 109 stakeholders in disaster-prone communities to recommend strategies to adopt circular economy practices post-disaster. The study results highlight the recurring risks of damage to different parts of the building and how circular economy resilience practices like deconstruction can minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency during post-disaster recovery. The findings of the study promote a more regenerative economy to build resilience to the challenges of future extreme weather events.

AB  - Learning from the sustainability of traditional architecture, as a solution to the current ecological crisis, seems more challenging in societies where a cultural imposition has occurred. In Burkina Faso, vernacular architecture has experienced a process of transformation, still in course, relying heavily on foreign resources and losing its adaptation to environmental conditions. As in other contexts, the dynamics of transformation are being examined. Joining this line of work, this research aims to explain the causes of the current local perception of traditional building techniques in Burkina Faso in order to consider how a sustainable development of its architecture would be possible. To this end, a historical analysis is conducted by reviewing the literature, consulting historical documents and collecting data during two stays in 2018. The study shows how earth has ceased to be appreciated by progressively becoming associated with "non-definitive constructions"; this perception is due to the narratives put forward by foreign agents since the end of the 19th century. The sustainable development of architecture in Burkina Faso seems to demand a return to the use of earth, local resource par excellence, but this will only be possible if the devaluation of this building material is reversed.

AB  - The question of how to transform suburbs into sustainable neighborhoods lies at the forefront of current planning research. However; many infill and redevelopment efforts remain piecemeal. This article argues that systemic densification can increase the benefits of retrofitting. In particular, the authors propose smart densification processes designed to transform collector roads into pedestrian-friendly streets and watercourses into local parks. Such a densification approach can attract growth and enhance pedestrian access to transportation, daily services, and neighborhood facilities. The proposal is illustrated with an example from the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). The authors suggest that only a holistic understanding of suburbs will allow planners to implement successful strategies for systemic densification that increase residents' quality of life.

AB  - Rowshan is the projected latticework window, commonly found in facades of traditional dwellings in Medina. Due to functions that Rowshan provides, such as overlooking the surroundings with complete privacy and controlling natural ventilation and lighting in the dwelling, it achieved a widespread popularity in the traditional architecture of Medina, which gave the city its unique architectural identity. This article explored the public's attitudes, awareness, and concerns on the dwindling traditional Islamic identity in contemporary architecture in Medina as well as to understand their social demands and functional aspiration as possible window's end users. The self-completed questionnaire was conducted with the general public in Madinah between the 1st of February 2017 and the 15th of March 2017, using the online web-based service, Google Forms. The link of the survey was distributed via emails and smartphones apps, such as WhatsApp, to the participants who were expected to complete the 23 questions of the survey within 15-20 minutes. The majority of study participants were males (73.1%), Saudis (79.2%), 30-49 years old (57.3%), had university degree (54.7%), house owners (54%), living in a flat (54.9%) and had a monthly income of up to SAR 10,000 (1900) pound (63%). The majority of people were severely concerned about the gradual erosion of the authentic architectural identity in contemporary architecture in Medina. Visual privacy, the functional performance, and aesthetic appearance were chosen by a remarkable proportion of participants of survey (24%), (22.9%), and (20.7%), respectively as the most important issues that determined their selection of window shading type. Rowshan, compared with contemporary windows, was more effective in covering home windows for achieving satisfying levels of aesthetic appearance, visual privacy, and daylight at homes compared with contemporary windows as people agreed. However, there are three major drawbacks that make using of the traditional form of Rowshan incompatible with contemporary Madani architecture. These are high cost, large number of Rowshan openings, and lack of craftsmen. The findings of the present study showed that Madani society was highly motivated and had a positive attitude toward using Rowshan in their homes.

AB  - The research on new ways to make our existing city more sustainable in economic and environmental terms has become a central theme at the national and international levels, with important implications for city management. The collective agenda is focused on retaining, refurbishing and recycling the existing elements by transforming wastes into new resources. This continuous cycle represented by the extension of the product life cycle and the enhancement of the discarded parts in the built environment is changing the economic system used for many centuries. The current linear economy model is going progressively to be converted into a more circular economy. Many sectors-like infrastructure, foods, enterprises, design etc.-are improving their efficiency by adopting a more circular pattern, but construction companies seem to be very far from this purpose. As one of the main sectors responsible of global energy consumption and waste production, the construction industry has to undergo a radical change in perspective on urban development, along with a new social, cultural, and economic interest in rebuilding the existing city in a sustainable way. The aim of this research is to highlight how to transform the construction industry through the circular economy to make urban reuse strategies more sustainable in social, economic and especially environmental terms. The paper considers not only the theoretical implications of the economic paradigm of circularity, but also case studies through which it is possible to evaluate its relevance in terms of design, production and management of such a new perspective. Through a critical analysis of the more relevant circular interventions in Europe to upcycle obsolete buildings, the research highlights the new fundamental rules for the construction industry to regenerate the existing cities. In particular, the cases studies show how the economic and environmental benefits apply to a circular model in the construction industry and how this system is able to generate new social and economic value in existing buildings. The second element is to show how to combine the circular economy with costs via technologies able to match circularity and environmental efficiency.

AB  - Environmental problems are being increasingly recognised as critical strategies for attaining sustainability in social housing, given the persistent demand for social housing in urban areas. However, to remain inexpensive, housing built for low-income groups requires greater environmental compromises. The main objective of this study is to examine social housing projects from an environmental sustainability standpoint and determine whether they have a low environmental impact. This study also aims to inform policymakers about the environmental sustainability of social housing projects and provide an opportunity to review housing policies in terms of environmental sustainability. Six social housing projects were selected under the same climatic conditions from Spain and Turkey, with distinct economic classifications and housing policies. The findings indicate that although social housing built in Spain has a smaller carbon footprint than Turkey throughout the manufacturing (A1-A3) and building (A4-A5) phases, social housing projects in both countries cannot be classified as low-impact housing projects.

AB  - In his book A Theory of General Ethics Warwick Fox puts forward ethical principles that explicitly embrace the built environment. The key concept is 'responsive cohesion', in which a 'thing' (creature, community, building) or process (learning, play, design) exhibits mutually beneficial interactions between itself and its contexts, and also between its internal components. This contrasts with domination by one factor (fixed cohesion) or anarchy (discohesion). This paper examines the impacts on the aesthetics, products, skills and discourses of architecture of accepting Fox's proposition that responsive cohesion is the foundational value in a general ethics. In design, achieving responsive cohesion with a context that already exhibits responsive cohesion is then ultimately more important than achieving it internally, although the aim is to achieve both. The largest and most important context is the natural or biophysical environment, because that sustains all other systems. The next largest context is the social environment. Recognising an ethics of responsive cohesion places emphasis on connection (not separation), on collaboration (not individualism) and on buildings as sustaining context (not buildings as objects). A 'perfect' building would respond with a convincing answer to any question about its internal and contextual relationships at local and global levels. This is a difficult achievement, and even acclaimed works of architecture may be far from this ideal.

AB  - High rise residential building has become a norm in the urban areas. In Malaysia, more than 30% of the urban population is currently living in stratified buildings, especially where urban land is scarce and expensive. Moreover, despite of landscape change and urbanisation process, there are several high rise properties in urban area that have been converted into foreign workers housing. It may affect the local communities and have a positive and negative impact to the social neighbourhood sustainability. Therefore, this study focuses on the residents' perceptions of foreign workers housing on social aspects, and qualitatively finds the action taken by building management body in addressing the issues. The study was located at the one of high rise properties in Klang Valley, namely Mandy Villa Apartment. The questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were the techniques employed to collect data, and the findings revealed the problems affecting the comfort and quality of living among strata residents. In this sense, the management has taken several actions to solve the problems, therefore, the stakeholders have to oversee the misuse of strata unit for future sustainable living in the urban area.

AB  - Studies on residential segregation of foreign population in Southern Europe usually focus on capital cities, omitting the metropolitan dimension and paying less attention to use of comparable analysis' spatial scales. These issues, together with the dominant use of two-group segregation indexes, prevent identification and classification of metropolitan patterns of residential segregation in such contexts. To overcome these key issues, the spatial segregation of foreign population in 16 Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) was investigated in Italy and Spain using global and local multi-group segregation indexes based on a regular geometry (100 m grid) and confronted with socioeconomic indicators profiling the local context. Results of this study reveal the absence of common metropolitan patterns of residential segregation in both countries. In turn, a greater level of residential segregation is correlated with a lower presence of immigrant population and depressed socioeconomic conditions of each FUA, suggesting the existence of a downward spiral toward social vulnerability in the most disadvantaged cities. These results finally indicate the increasing difficulties faced by foreigners in order to access the real estate market in Southern European cities.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate to what degree young adults live in neighbourhoods that are similar, in terms of relative average household income, to the neighbourhoods in which they grew up. We use regression analysis on register data for all individuals who were born in 1974 and lived in metropolitan Sweden in both 1990 and 2006. During this period, the distribution of income in Sweden became far more unequal, unemployment rose dramatically, earlier housing policies were dismantled, the share of visible minorities' increased dramatically, and residential segregation increased very considerably. We find a correlation between average neighbourhood incomes at these two points in the sample's life cycle of 0.44, which is more than three times as high as the household income correlation. We also find that half of the children of visible minorities' grew up in the poorer quartile of neighbourhoods, and of these, almost two-thirds remained in the poorest quartile of neighbourhoods as adults. Several measures indicate that intergenerational persistency in context is lower in metropolitan Sweden than was found in a similar study in the US. However, it appears that if visible minority individuals lived in a neighbourhood in the lowest part of the distribution in Sweden as a child, the probability that they will do so also as adults is as high as the corresponding probability for an African-American person in the US.

AB  - This research is one of the few studies to investigate the mutual impact between residential segregation and the commuting outcomes of minority groups in the context of a developing country. Based on previous empirical studies that acknowledged the interactions between the built environment and travel behavior, we develop a Structural Equation Model to illustrate the multi-directional relationships between residential segregation, the built environment and commute outcomes. With survey data collected from migrant workers in 12 Chinese cities, we apply this model to estimate these complex mutual relationships. Our major findings include: 1) Both residential segregation and the built environment have significant causal impact on migrants' commute distance and duration. Distance from home to downtown has the strongest causal effect on commute outcomes, while residential segregation in urban villages ranks the second. 2) Residential sorting is observed. Commuting distance and duration significantly affects migrants' choice of built environment features. 3) However, commuting outcomes are not a major (or statistically significant) driver of migrant workers' residential segregation in urban villages. In other words, their choice to reside in urban villages is inelastic to the commuting outcomes of these villages. Other factors such as housing affordability may be more influential. Therefore, demolishing urban villages under "urban renewal" policies will force migrants to relocate to more remote areas with worse job accessibility. These findings have important implications for recently proposed urban renewal policies that are bringing large-scale changes in China. They also offer important insights for other developing countries that are experiencing rapid urbanization. Finally, the framework of this study can be generalized and applied to other countries to examine similar urban issues.

Over these two decades, the old, declining, industrial city has turned into a service-based city where the central-peripheral divide remains and, at the same time, the urban periphery has fragmented in socio-residential terms. The public authorities have acted as "housing developers", significantly influencing the patterns of residential segregation and local identification, principally through their housing and publicly-owned land policies over the period studied.

The research method used stratified purposeful sampling, and the household survey data were analyzed using factor analysis, multiple regression and ANOVA statistical methods.FindingsThe most influential factors on the overall QoUL of individuals living in different Kayseri residential neighborhoods were satisfaction with neighborhood and city-level urban services, neighborhood relations and belonging factor groups. The critical finding obtained in this study is that residential satisfaction in low-rise and compact form housing areas in Kayseri is higher compared to residential satisfaction in high-rise neighborhoods. This result reveals that the high-rise building typology that is dominant in Turkey's big cities should be seriously questioned, and urban development policies should be re-evaluated.Research limitations/implicationsThe study was designed to produce baseline data so that future changes in residential conditions as perceived by the residents of Kayseri could be monitored to support decisions for residential areas.Originality/valueComparative case studies, particularly on low-rise versus high-rise environments, are scarce. As a result, this research contributes to the field of comparative studies on residential environments.

AB  - Residential satisfaction has been assessed by various authors, who reported varying degrees of dissatisfaction and satisfaction. However, the differences in satisfaction among the various housing components remain an issue. The study investigates residential satisfaction in specific housing estates in Lokoja, Kogi State, aiming to understand the various aspects that contribute to satisfaction. The research collected responses from 215 residents and employed statistical analysis using SPSS version 21. Among the four housing sub-components examined, satisfaction levels varied. Housing unit attributes had the lowest satisfaction level, indicating poor satisfaction. Housing socio- economic attributes, housing neighbourhood attributes, and housing management attributes showed moderate satisfaction levels. Significantly different satisfaction levels were found among these sub-components, as demonstrated by the Kruskal-Wallis test outcomes. Satisfaction with housing unit attributes, socio-economic attributes, and neighbourhood attributes were all statistically significant. Interestingly, satisfaction with the management attribute was not statistically significant due to high resident involvement in housing management. The study suggests revising government policies regarding public housing estates and emphasizes resident involvement throughout the housing process to enhance satisfaction across all sub-components. These findings have implications for housing policies, urban planning, and resource allocation, striving for more inclusive and satisfying living conditions. The study's outcomes could influence housing development approaches, ultimately improving the overall quality of life in Lokoja, Kogi State.

AB  - Purpose - This paper examines residential satisfaction in welfare housing facilities exclusively built for lowincome single-mother households in South Korea. The main objective is to identify predictors from among various domains such as sociodemographic and psychological characteristics of residents, as well as objective and subjective characteristics of their residential environment. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed-method field study evaluates data obtained via structured questionnaires administered to 233 low-income single mothers in 23 residential welfare facilities across South Korea, supplemented by facility observations and interviews with housing staff from 16 facilities. Findings - Residential satisfaction was found to be a multidimensional construct predicted by a number of variables, with psychological characteristics being dominant. Significant predictors were also identified among physical and sociospatial environmental characteristics, such as plan type, management and service and personal space. Practical implications - The results of this study highlight the significance of the human aspects of management and the sociospatial quality of housing unit spaces to provide a sense of protection and privacy for the residents, which emphasizes the importance of management, design and policy improvements to increase satisfaction in welfare facility residents. Originality/value - Currently, data for special housing conditions of female-headed households in unstable housing affordability are relatively few and outdated. A critical examination of the physical and sociospatial quality of short-term subsidized public housing for low-income single-mother households in South Korea expands the current knowledge in this field to various sociodemographic and cultural contexts.

AB  - This paper studies residential satisfaction among original residents in the redeveloped inner-city neighbourhoods of Beijing. It is based on a questionnaire survey that was conducted in four neighbourhoods redeveloped at different time periods in the past 15 years. The survey data suggest an overall low level of satisfaction across all four neighbourhoods. Only the unit size and length of stay significantly relate to residential satisfaction. The survey shows that low residential satisfaction does not lead to frequent moving behaviours despite high moving intentions. These findings contradict hypotheses in the Western literature about lower residential satisfaction associated with higher mobility. In Western studies, residential satisfaction determines housing adjustment and mobility behaviours, which form the basis for public intervention. The central assumption is that residents' mobility will be relatively unhindered by factors other than personal financial ability. By differentiating between voluntary and involuntary relocation behaviour, this paper attempts to understand the interrelationship between residential satisfaction, moving intention and moving behaviour within the context of China's political economy. Residents in this study showed a lack of ability to adjust their changing housing needs although they had strong desires to do so. China's housing reform provides a valuable opportunity to examine the impacts of constraints and choices on residential satisfaction, and sheds light on decision processes of housing market development.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify the drivers of residential price as well as the degree co-movement of housing among different states in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted an advanced econometrics technique: the dynamic autoregressive-distributed lag (DARDL) and - the time-frequency domain approach known as the wavelet coherence test. The DARDL model was applied to identify the cointegrating relationships and the CWT was used to analyze the co-movement and lead-lag relationships among four states' regional housing prices. The extracted data were mainly on annual basis and comprised macroeconomics and financial factors. Information with regard to residential prices and other variables was extracted from the National Property Information Centre (NAPIC) website, the Central Bank of Malaysia Statistics Report, the Department of Statistics, Malaysia, I-Property.com and the World Bank (WB). The data covered in this study were the pool data from four main states in Malaysia and different categories of residential properties. Findings The empirical results indicate that there were long-run cointegration relationships between the housing price and capital gain and loss, rental per square feet, disposable income, inflation, number of marriages, deposit rate, risk premium and loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. While the wavelet analysis shows that (1) in the long run, Kuala Lumpur housing price having strong co-movement with Selangor, Penang and Melaka housing prices except for Johor and (2) the lead-lag relationship also postulates Kuala Lumpur housing price having in-phase category with Selangor, Penang and Melaka housing prices except for Johor. Practical implications This study offers relevant practical implications. First, the study proposes an active collaboration between the private sector and government support which may help to smooth the pricing issue of residential properties. More low-cost residential projects are needed for focus groups including middle- and low-income earners. Furthermore, the results are expected to provide real estate investor in Malaysia, an improved understanding of the regional housing market price dynamics. Originality/value The findings of this study were obtained from various reliable sources; therefore, the results reflected the analysis of price drivers and co-movements. Furthermore, findings from this study lend some support to the argument on the rise of residential prices and offer several policy implications from a practical point of view with regard to the residential market.

AB  - In this paper an analysis of residential mobility and sorting by income and housing tenure in Stockholm is carried out. The study contrasts two periods: one (1990-2001) characterised by recovery after the economic crisis in 1991-1992 and one (2002-2014) characterised by large changes to the housing stock composition. With the use of a longitudinal full population data set, it is shown that the socioeconomic composition of movers is relatively stable over time, while the economic sorting of movers increases. People with low income are increasingly likely to move into low-income neighbourhoods, whether they move into the rental or owner segments of the housing market. Those who own their housing unit and mid- to high-income earners increasingly avoid moving to low-income neighbourhoods. The paper concludes that the increasingly owner-dominated housing market in Stockholm contributes to stronger socio-spatial residential patterns through the economic sorting of movers across the whole income scale.

It was started by the Japanese Housing Corporation in 1973 to research and develop the flexibility and adaptability of housing. The authors examined whether the adaptability worked over the last 35 years of occupancy, and they found that the many residents performed infill renovation in their units using the KEP movable partitions and storage systems. As the children grew and left home, some families used the KEP system to adjust room arrangements to meet their changing lifestyles.

AB  - With the need for a green economy and the introduction of low-carbon policies, more and more old buildings are being transformed to improve the thermal performance of buildings and reduce energy consumption. However, people ignore the village buildings and the old public buildings. Based on the investigation of a typical health center in Linyi City, this paper proposed improvement measures using EnergyPlus simulation software and JePlus parameter chemical tools. The various factors analyze the various parts of the enclosure, and the energy-saving effect of the roof is better than that of the exterior wall: When the thickness of the insulation layer gradually increases from 0 cm to 30 cm, the unit energy consumption of the building gradually decreases from 57 kW center dot h/m(2) to 42.8 kW center dot h/m(2), while that of the roof is gradually reduced to 24.41 kW center dot h/m(2). Double exterior windows effectively reduce the energy consumption of the building in all renovation schemes. The optimal scheme is selected through the parameterized design of all the overall enclosure reconstruction schemes and the initial investments. The results showed that the investment recovery of the selected scheme was between 1.36-5.28 years. Plan 5 (12 cm XPS is used as insulation material for the exterior wall and roof, and the exterior window is replaced with 6 mm medium transmittance Low-e + 12 mm air + 6 mm clear) had the highest energy efficiency (91.11%). Plan 2 (6 cm XPS is used as insulation material for the exterior wall and roof, and the exterior window is replaced with 12 mm single medium transmittance heat-reflecting glass) had the shortest investment recovery period (2.04 years).

AB  - The core purpose of architectural lighting research is to ensure safety, improve visual performance and human performance, optimize the light quality of living environments, and improve human well-being. This paper briefly reviews the development context, current hot spots. experimental environment, experimental subjects. and measurement methods of human factors research in architectural lighting. Then we discuss the effectiveness of physiological measurement, performance measurement and psychological measurement within the overall framework of the built environment. Finally, we look forward to the cross research of multi-enviromnental parameters across sensory channels. At present, a core problem faced by architectural lighting research and design is that the quantity, spectrum, distribution, irradiation time and duration of light act on both visual systems and non-visual systems. Visual effects focus on the light received by the object (visual task and background), while non-visual effects focus on the light received by the human eye. With the interaction between non-visual effects and visual effects, the rational operation of space needs to be reconsidered. It is nonnegligible to quantify the characteristics of luminous environments, especially the variation characteristics of dynamic daylight. and bring them into the scientific system of quantitative experiments in the era of human factors. The experimental environment mainly includes immersive real environments and virtual environments, and isolated image/video evaluation environments. Experiments in the actual scene can get the human response closest to the reality, but face many interference factors. Therefore. the experiments are mostly carried out in a laboratory environment where the variables are easy to control. The ability of virtual reality to restore the feeling of real space is closest to the real environment. However, virtual reality equipment cannot restore the brightness and spectrum of the real situation, leading to the results of poor reliability and guidance. In isolated evaluation environments, the evaluation effectiveness of realism such as depth of field, comfort and existence is poor, though the variables in it are easy to control. The research methods of human factors research in architectural lighting include physiological measurements, psychological measurements, behavior measurements, performance evaluation and so on. When selecting research methods, the characteristics of luminous environments, the action mechanism of visual/non-visual pathway and human visual characteristics should be considered. Human factors research should abide by experimental ethics. With the trend of multi-environmental-parameter studies, the architectural lighting research excavates the blind spots from the perspective of thermology and acoustics. The action mechanism of cross sensory channel interactive perception was revealed systematically to improve the theoretical system of indoor comprehensive environments.

AB  - To cope with the fast urbanisation and population growth, the public and private sector housing developments in Kuala Lumpur have prioritised the high-rise apartment building. After decades' massive development, this housing type became the most dominant dwelling form in the city. For centuries, the traditional Malay house has evolved to suit to the vernacular lifestyle, but now the urban life mandates that people adapt themselves to this alien concrete house. This paper investigated the hidden cultural link between these two seemingly different house forms. Using graph-theoretic methods, we traced how old domestic activities were transferred to the modern housing and revealed how the old spatial order of front/back and high/low distinctions could be re-configured inside the high-rise apartment housing in a creative way by Malaysian architects. There have been frictions and compromises between the past and present, but the outcomes of this research clearly indicate that there exists a cultural DNA of Malay housing that guides the whole process of housing evolution.

AB  - Purpose Against the backdrop of the changing trends in tenure in the UK housing system, young adults are faced with different situations that continue to shape their housing consumption and decisions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships amongst young adults' housing tenure, social capital and elements of perceived job security in Britain. Socio-psychological dimension of housing tenure decisions has been receiving attention by housing market analysts and practitioners seeking deeper understandings of the UK housing market dynamics, particularly in the wake of changing tastes and preferences of young people concerning housing decisions across major cities of the world. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach has been applied to the harmonised version of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) from 2001 to 2015. Findings The authors discovered that British young adults' homeownership decisions are increasingly influenced by social capital and elements of perceived job insecurity, depending on their tenure of origin. Furthermore, this study will significantly enhance the understanding of tenure shifts amongst young adults in the UK and provide property developers, local authorities and central governments the knowledge and information to guide economic policies, urban renewal towards achieving better social cohesion and sustainable communities. Originality/value Very little has been done to investigate the contributions of social capital formation, for example, neighbourhood or social integration and social relations and elements of perceived job security on housing tenure transitions among British young adults. This study will further provide property developers, local authorities and central governments the knowledge and information to guide economic policies, urban renewal towards achieving better social cohesion and sustainable communities.

AB  - During the state socialist era, a small number of New Towns were also built in Hungary. Few of these were true 'green-field' projects, as most of them were developed into larger towns from one or more smaller settlements. Nevertheless, we can still call them New Towns, since they were turned into cities of national importance in a short time through a conceptual construction process. They provide many lessons to be learned. The heyday of their construction lasted a few years beginning from the early 50s, the period when Hungary underwent significant changes in political and social values which noticeably left their mark on our built environment. According to the contemporary press, the building of these towns was also a kind of experiment. Today this is well-known. Also, it is clear that these towns should be much more flexible in order to adapt to the many changes of the past 65 years. The following paper analyses the first two Hungarian socialist New Towns to be constructed. It describes the political context, the political and economic reasons behind the construction of industrial New Towns, and their impact on the planning process, structure and architecture of these settlements. Regarding the questions of how a municipality can deal with this kind of historic heritage today and whether it can replace its lost identity with new elements in a very different social political situation, it highlights the role of reinterpretations of central public areas in (mental and physical) urban renewal.

AB  - Extant research has highlighted the importance of multiple characteristics of housing but has not comprehensively assessed a broad range of housing characteristics and their relative contributions to children's well-being. Using a representative, longitudinal sample of low-income children and adolescents from low-income urban neighborhoods (N = 2,437, ages 2-21 years) from the Three-City Study, this study assessed housing quality, stability, type (i.e., ownership status and subsidy status), and cost simultaneously to delineate their unique associations with children's development. Hierarchical linear models found that poor housing quality was most consistently associated with children's and adolescents' development, including worse emotional and behavioral functioning and lower cognitive skills. These associations operated in part through mothers' psychological functioning. Residential instability showed mixed links with functioning, whereas housing cost and type were not consistently predictive. Results suggest that housing contexts are associated with functioning across the developmental span from early childhood through late adolescence, with some differences in patterns by child age.

AB  - Home-share housing was a popular alternative for housing pilgrims and Umrah performers in Makkah until about three decades ago. This research study aims to examine the feasibility of reactivating contemporary home-share housing to accommodate Umrah performers, as an alternative to achieve the objectives of the Saudi Vision 2030. Home-share housing has become part of a growing global movement in the field of hospitality industry, within the entrepreneurship based on the digital economy.To consider the possibility of activating home-share housing to accommodate Umrah performers, this study adopts the archival research approach )descriptive-historical(. The historical development of housing for pilgrims and Umrah performers in Makkah was reviewed, with an emphasis on the history of home-share housing and its characteristics, the reasons for its disappearance in Makkah were also clarified. Furthermore, the general concept of contemporary participatory housing, the factors contributing to its spread, and its pros and cons were discussed. The study concluded that contemporary home-share housing for Umrah performers will be appropriate for application within the percentage of permanent housing in the major housing projects, which are being implemented near Al-Haram. Contemporary home-share housing will contribute to the realization of several strategic pillars of the 'Guests of God' service program. It has been shown that home-share housing is a flexible housing alternative, which enriches the socio-cultural experience of both guests and hosts, enables local entrepreneurship programs, and contributes to the promotion of local economic growth. However, the study recommends the need to establish local criteria for this type of housing, before applying it to ensure quality.

AB  - Problem-The constant culture and its tradition of Chinese architecture came to the edge of an exhaustive subversion, based on which the ecological recovery of Chinese architecture should be paid enough attention to as a kind of national strategic perspective. Crux-Under undue emphases put on politics, rigidly uniforms made as national plans habitually and economic construction taken as the national development center for a too long time, the forms, connotation and quality of Chinese buildings were alienated. Principle-In order to make for the value realization and the happiness of the livelihood, the maximum of respects for civil rights and the revival of traditional culture for national architecture, the Doctrine of the Mean should be advocated and restored. Method-By meanings of amending the "property law", the land reform can be developed and the holonomic ownership rights of real estate can follow behind; By meanings of decentralizing the jurisdiction of civilian construction, the self-organizing construction activity in the folk can be encouraged. Aims-Attempt to highlight the regional characteristics, interpret our national culture, inherit traditional techniques in architecture and establish a kind of collective harmony, where the exact collective unconscious nostalgia and memories can be shared among the civilians.

AB  - Mass housing neighbourhoods (MHN) represent the leading pattern of urban transformation and expansion in the second half of the 20th century, and accordingly evaluation, regeneration and redesign of the MHN represent a necessary and challenging task in the contemporary research context. In the practical scope of MHN rehabilitation, various holistic approaches and design strategies are identified that affirm both ecological transition and social transformation of these urban settings. However, the level of application of such approaches across Europe varies greatly, and requires research initiatives of a comparative nature that open a cross-geographical debate at the European level. Although there is a series of evidence-based studies that define the conceptual framework of MHN, i.e., large-scale housing settlements, through historical-interpretative and chronological analyses, the academic debate on practical and feasible MHN rehabilitation and their sustainable integration into the urban development of cities at European level is underdeveloped. The specific objective of this paper is to establish preliminary insights into the current level of MHN rehabilitation and to identify challenges for further actions through (1) a comparative analysis of MHN role models from the second half of 20th century, and through (2) insights from an implemented expert questionnaire. The research engages a comparative case study analysis as the primary method and analyses MHN in Germany (as a representative of Western Europe) and in the two ex-Yugoslav countries, North Macedonia and Serbia (as representatives of Eastern Europe). This research has highlighted the main obstacles and challenges for MHN rehabilitation and demonstrated the importance of a multiscale approach to MHN analysis, having in mind that through the distribution of design values at the analysed spatial levels (neighbourhood level, building level, and apartment level) the application of affirmative indicators within different design values group is recognised.

AB  - With new rail lines, residents can enjoy higher accessibility and more activity opportunities. However, better access to public transport can potentially increase land prices in catchment areas. In this research, we aim to investigate whether this capitalisation effect goes beyond the conventional catchment area and how such an effect varies across different regions. In a departure from previous studies, we employed a gravity-based accessibility measure to capture the regional impact of rail lines using a cross-sectional analysis of 2001 and 2011 residential apartment data in Hong Kong and a difference-in-difference approach to estimate repeated sales transacted in both years. We used a three-level hierarchical estimation method that allowed the price effect to vary by submarket. The results indicated that the network accessibility of rail lines had a statistically significant capitalisation effect on property prices that varied across different submarkets. Although the three major new rail lines had a greater impact on the built environment in suburban areas, the elasticities in property price with regard to accessibility were still larger in urban areas in both 2001 and 2011. We also establish that the improvements in rail accessibility had a substantially greater effect on the changes in property price between 2001 and 2011 in several new town submarkets along the new lines. From a regional perspective, we conclude that the price effect of new transport infrastructure goes beyond the local catchment areas and call for urban policies that address housing affordability issues across different submarkets in the region and a re-examination of land value capture policies.

AB  - Traditional desert cities used a compact urban form since it provides benefits in terms of thermal comfort both in urban and interior spaces. However, many current desert cities have shifted to a sprawling model with isolated low-rise buildings, leading to longer travel distances, increased land use, inadequate public space, and higher demand for building cooling. Our study aims to investigate how vertical urban densification can reduce residential cooling demand in hot-dry regions. To achieve this, we compared single-family houses with high-rise multi-family houses in Hermosillo, Mexico. Eight case studies of real houses were selected, representing the city's building stock, including one- and two-story single-family houses, and high-rise multi-family houses. We use dynamic energy simulations to assess the effectiveness of changing building's shape against improving its insulation. Our results indicate that increasing vertical density leads to a reduction in the envelope-to-volume ratio, resulting in a significant decrease in cooling demand. Moving from a one-story single-family house to a high-rise multi-family house can lead to a 72 % reduction in annual cooling demand. Matching the fa & ccedil;ade material properties of singlefamily houses and multi-family houses reduces the cooling demands of the single-family houses by 16 %-31 %. However, they still have higher cooling demands compared to high-rise multifamily houses, suggesting that building form has a greater impact on cooling than thermal insulation. Our findings highlight the substantial energy savings achievable by transitioning from detached single-family houses to high-rise multi-family developments in desert cities.

AB  - In hot dry climates, it is estimated that almost half the urban peak load of energy consumption is used to satisfy air-conditioning cooling demands in summer time. Since the urbanization rate in developing countries - like the case in Egypt - is rising rapidly, the pressure placed on energy resources to satisfy inhabitants' indoor comfort requirements is consequently increasing too. This paper introduces passive cool roof as a means of reducing energy cooling loads for satisfying human comfort requirements in a hot climate. A designed algorithmic hybrid matrix was used to simulate 37 roof design probabilities alternating roof shape, roof material and construction. The result of using a vault roof with high albedo coating shows a fall of 53% in discomfort hours and saves 826 kWh during the summer season compared to the base case of the conventional non insulated flat roof in a typical Cairo residential buildings. It is recommended that the selected cool roof solution be combined with natural ventilation to increase the indoor thermal comfort, and with passive heating strategies to compensate the increase in heating hours. The application is intended for low cost residential buildings in a hot dry climate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Green building construction has received global interest over the past two decades. The definition of a green building has evolved from energy-efficient buildings to net-zero buildings, and now is expanding towards net-positive buildings. Even though these concepts entail significant environmental benefits, they largely overlook life cycle environmental impacts associated with building construction. While net-zero to net-positive development is expected to result in operational environmental benefits, the energy demand reduction and renewable energy-related interventions carry added life cycle impacts during the construction and demolition stages. Therefore, without taking a life cycle thinking perspective to green building assessment, it is difficult to quantify the exact environmental benefits. To address this issue, this research aims to develop life cycle performance benchmarks for green buildings and to provide a mechanism to rate "green" buildings based on life cycle environmental performance. A methodological framework was developed to evaluate the aggregated life cycle performance of green buildings, thus enabling the best choices in green building design through a more holistic perspective. The proposed framework is deployed by combining life cycle thinking with BIM, which can be used to monitor and track building inputs and construction practices under various scenarios. Outcomes of this research will redefine the concept of green buildings and will lay out the foundation for constructing zero impact on civil infrastructure. The findings will assist the construction industry, community developers, and government authorities to ensure that sustainable development goals are being met in a true and holistic sense.

AB  - The destruction during the Second World War made the city a crisis of looming proportions throughout Europe. In the case of France, over three-quarters of the country was struck by the war. Cities and towns were in ruins. Over 2 million buildings, a quarter of the housing stock, was destroyed or damaged (Croize, 1991, pp. 253-257). A million families were left homeless. Millions of others lived in temporary shelters and run-down apartments without access to basic services. This tragic situation made the housing crisis-that is finding a place of live-one of the most serious and explosive post-war domestic issues in France, as it was all over Europe. One way the crisis was addressed was far men and women to build their own homes, or to simply occupy vacant buildings. This paper looks at the role of the organised self-help housing movement within the massive effort of reconstruction and building after the Second World War, from 1945-1954. The movement comprised three phases: the squatter movement; the mouvement Castors or Beavers movement, which became a limited effort at auto-construction; and lastly, the housing campaign launched by the Abbe Pierre.

AB  - The analysis of a number of Toronto sub-populations consistently points to differences in the home-ownership rates between visible minorities and whites. People of African or Caribbean origin have a much lower chance of being home-owners compared to whites after controlling for differences in income levels, housing preferences and household characteristics. Differences in tenure profiles are reduced at higher income levels but the home-ownership deficit remains. Economic factors explain only a small part of the large difference. Cultural and institutional factors may determine how the tenure options are perceived and valued by different groups of people living in the same city. Biases in perceptions matter as they affect the extent to which people can gain from the direct and indirect subsidies offered to home-owners. The differences may be indicative of underlying problems some minorities face in gaining access to urban resources. Measures of home-ownership deficits among the black and Caribbean suggest the need for social policy that goes beyond income maintenance and housing subsidies groups to help equalise their social and economic opportunities.

AB  - This study examines the patterns and predictors of housing turnovers among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Puerto Ricans, and other Hispanics in New York City during 1978-1987 to assess whether access to housing is distributed differentially by race and ethnicity. The data are taken from the triennial New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey. After controlling for household preferences, purchasing power, and quality characteristics of the housing unit, multinomial logistic regression results show the most consistent and significant predictors of turnover to be geographic and market-sector attributes. The findings suggest the presence of structural constraints in the housing market which effectively channel racial/ethnic groups to separate neighborhoods. The overall results are reminiscent of early studies of neighborhood transition by Duncan and Duncan (1957) and Taeuber and Taeuber (1965), and show that little progress has been made toward achieving equality in housing or informal social contact between racial/ethnic groups.

AB  - As one of the basic narratives of culture, traditional residential architecture is an important value, indicating its relationship with its environment. Due to this, the continuity of culture in rural areas is closely related with the sustainability of traditional residential architecture. Cyprus is a Mediterranean island, which has managed to sustain her rich cultural heritage against the many economical, socio-cultural and political changes she has gone through. There is a need for new dwellings in rural areas and this demand is increasing rapidly. In these areas which are physical environments where sustainability can be maintained easily, the Social Housing Department of the North Cyprus Government has made several studies for the proposal of prototype house plans' as a solution to the above mentioned problem of a need for housing and the prevention of migration to cities. However, upon analysing the architecture of traditional dwellings; and the life-styles of the people who live in these rural areas, it has been observed that these projects, with incomprehensible, strict and totalitarian design principles, are incompatible with local culture and conditions. It is suggested that there is a need for an appropriate environment for the continuation of the life-style that is natural to the people that live within them. Oil the contrary, these projects form the basis of a step towards a monotonous settlement development which does not respect either the values of traditional architecture or local identities. It is extremely important that the correct steps are taken for both the conservation of the existing physical environment and for handling the issues of new settlement developments in relation to production relationships and cultural sustainability. The main aim of this paper is to draw attention to the traditional design principles that can be re-interpreted in the proposed 'prototyped dwellings' in North Cyprus. In order to achieve this aim, a case study, based oil observations, literature survey and site survey techniques has been carried out. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parametric design and optimization studies have demonstrated high energy savings for dynamic building en-velope materials compared to static high-performance envelopes. However, most parametric studies about dy-namic buildings were conducted on prototypical buildings with a focus on either optimal geometric settings or idealized material property characteristics, neglecting the potential collective effects of geometric and material design decisions on energy performance. This study investigates the implications of an automated sequential optimization process while designing with dynamic envelope materials. Two case studies were used to quantify energy savings across different optimization-based design procedures and identify the relative importance of various decision categories. When considering realistic design constraints and intrinsic material limitations, geometric optimization alone yielded only 2% energy savings, while dynamic material optimization savings reached up to 19%. Significantly, a sequential design process in which the geometry is configured first before the facade is optimized and vice versa can lead to around 5% missed energy savings. These findings encourage changes to traditional design guidelines and simulation-based building design approaches when working with dynamic facades.

AB  - This paper examines China's urban housing sector and proposes that property tax reform be undertaken. Specifically, China should significantly reduce taxes on transactions and introduce property taxes during the possession of houses. This will increase housing affordability as a result of lower transaction costs, reduce speculation because of the higher opportunity cost of holding vacant houses, stabilize the fiscal system by generating more sustainable tax revenue, and improve the efficiency and fairness of the property tax system according to the principles of "ability-to-pay" and "userpays".

AB  - This paper examines housing policies aimed at establishing mixed income communities. Based on stakeholder interviews and case study analysis in England and Scotland, the paper pays particular attention to the impact of interventions in housing management. The first part considers the policy context for mixed communities and considers the conceptual basis underlying contemporary housing management through discourses of culture and social control. The second part considers how this agenda has resulted in the adoption of intensive management strategies within mixed communities; illustrated in the development of allocation policies, initiatives designed to tackle anti-social behaviour, and proposals to develop sustainable communities. The main argument is that given that the concept of mixed communities is based on the premise of social housing failure, citizenship has been defined largely in response to private sector interests. This approach to management has been a contributory factor in the construction of social housing as a form of second-class citizenship.

AB  - Housing prices have been soaring in China since the past decade. Rising housing prices indicate good opportunities in the labor and housing markets, which can discourage the entrepreneurial investment decisions of would-be entrepreneurs. However, high appreciation in housing prices can also relax credit constraints in setting up nascent businesses and thereby encourage entrepreneurship. This study investigates whether rising housing prices have a pulling or pushing effect on entrepreneurial activities. We find that housing price has a diminishingly negative effect on entrepreneurial activities using data from China's Urban Household Survey and China Statistical Yearbook for Regional Economy for the period 2002-2009. The mechanisms underlying why housing price affects entrepreneurship-labor market opportunities, relaxation of credit constraints, and housing market opportunities-are also investigated. Overall, this study offers new insights into entrepreneurial activities and highlights the negative externalities of overheated housing market to entrepreneurship in developing countries.

AB  - This article analyzes the role of social housing in Ireland's property bubble and its experience of the global financial crisis. The article argues that over recent decades social housing has been transformed from a countercyclical measure which counterbalances the market into a procyclical measure which fuelled Ireland's housing boom. The reform of social housing financing and acquisition mechanisms has embedded social housing in the boom/bust dynamics of the private housing system. Analyzing the shifting relationship between social and private housing is crucial to understanding the role of housing policy in Ireland's property bubble as well as the current housing crisis. Despite being caused by problems in the private housing and financial systems, the crisis has had very negative consequences for social housing, thus producing a crisis across the housing system as a whole.

AB  - Energy poverty is a social problem that is accentuated in a climate change future scenario where families become increasingly vulnerable. This problem has been studied in cold weather, but it also takes place in warm climates such as those of Mediterranean countries, and it has not been widely targeted. In these countries, approximately 70% of its building stock was built during 1960-1980, its renovation being an opportunity to reduce its energy demand, improve tenants' quality of life, and make it more resilient to climate change. In the retrofitting process, it is also important to consider tenants' adaptability and regional scenarios. In this sense, the present work proposes an assessment model of retrofitting projects that takes into consideration energy consumption, comfort, tenants' health, and monetary poverty. For this, the Index of Vulnerable Homes was implemented in this research to consider adaptive comfort in the energy calculation as well as the adaptability to climate change. A case study of 40 social housings in Seville, Spain, was analyzed in 2050 and 2080 future scenarios, defining the impact in energy poverty of the building retrofitting projects.

AB  - It is well known most often that values of properties tend to hike at the effluxion of time. This has necessitated the adoption of predictive models in interpreting outcomes in the property market in the future. Earlier studies have been oblivious of such models' outcomes as it affects any focal group, particularly the vulnerable. This present study focuses on the low-income earners found in the slum. The Ijora community in Lagos was the highlight of this study, particularly Ijora Badia and Ijora Oloye, regarded as slums according to the UNDP report. The entire fifty-two (52) local agents in the Ijora community were surveyed in cross-sectional survey research that entailed the questionnaire's issuance. The nexus of data collection, pre-processing, data analysis, algorithm application, and model evaluation resulted in retrieving rental values within the years 2010 and 2019 on two predominant residential property types of self-contain and one-bedroom flats found within the community. Three selected algorithms, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression, were essentially used as classifiers but trained to predict the continuous values. These algorithms were implemented through the use of Python's SciKit-learn Library and RapidMiner. The findings revealed that though all three models gave accurate predictions, Logistic Regression was the highest with low error values. It was recommended that Logistic Regression be applied but with much data set of property values of low-income earners over much more period. This study will contribute to the Sustainable development goals(SDG) 11(Sustainable cities and communities) of the United Nations to benefit developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - In recent decades, many studies have attempted to develop a reliable occupancy model using either rule -based, stochastic, data-driven, or agent-based approaches. These are based on the hypothesis that occu-pant presence can become predictable provided sufficient knowledge and data are provided. However, a different view propounds that occupant presence could follow a random-walk pattern or become unpre-dictable in certain types of rooms/buildings, for example, university labs and library buildings. In this study, the authors report the predictability of occupant presence in high-rise residential apartment build-ings in South Korea. The authors collected occupant presence data from 31 households over 147 days using occupancy sensors installed in each household. The predictability of occupant presence was then analyzed using the normalized cumulative periodogram (NCP) and Bartlett's test. It was found that (1) the predictability of occupant presence is significantly influenced by temporal and spatial resolutions, (2) extending measurement periods (e.g., 7 days vs 147 days) can increase the predictability of occupant presence, (3) for a measurement period of 7 days, the occupant presence for 14 households became unpredictable, and (4) the predictability of occupant presence significantly differs among 31 households.

AB  - Debates about sustainable architecture and cities are shaped by different social interests and diverse agendas, based on different interpretations of the environmental challenge and characterized by different pathways, each pointing towards a range of sustainable futures. The related analytical framework of sociotechnical theory presented here responds to the contingent and contextual nature of technological innovation and building design. This analysis recognizes both the contested nature of the sustainability concept and the need to encompass the differing contextual values of the design process across cultures when understanding buildings. In order to more fully understand the heterogeneity of sustainable architecture we therefore have to account for the multiple ways environmental problems are identified, defined, translated, valued and then embodied in built forms through diverse design and development pathways. Exploring debates and mapping practices of sustainable architecture involves tracing the interplay of competing environmental values and practices through the enactment of alternative design logics as they shape the technonatural profiles of green building development. While acknowledging how a technical, performance-based approach to understanding environmental design has brought undoubted benefits in terms of highlighting the issues of energy efficiency in buildings, the article argues that we must fundamentally revise the focus and scope of the debate about sustainable architecture and reconnect issues of appropriate technological change to the social and cultural processes and practices within which a specific design is situated. Drawing upon more critical, interpretative, participative and pragmatic approaches sustainable design would involve researchers both in defining the nature of the environmental challenge while encouraging a wider range of context-specific responses. By exploring sustainable architectures, in the plural, as competing interpretation's of our environmental futures, we can begin to ask new questions, introduce some fresh thinking, and find new 'socially viable' solutions to the mounting challenges associated with climate change.

AB  - Homelessness among refugee populations has been increasing worldwide in recent years, which provides particular challenges for receiving nations. In a context in which formal systems supporting asylum seekers and refugees face high demand relative to their resource levels, the impact this may have on the homelessness sector to provide support and accommodation for asylum seekers and refugees has received scant attention. This paper presents a systematic review that synthesizes the literature on the determinants of Homelessness among refugees. The study reviewed seven electronic databases from 2002 to December 2019. Most studies exploring Homelessness among refugees were drawn from Canada, Australia, the UK., and the U.S. Overall, refugees constitute a vulnerable population at heightened risk of becoming homeless. The complex interplay between individual and structural pathways into homeless also makes it difficult for refugees to exit Homelessness. Our metadata analysis of the literature further supports that housing, family, health, community, political circumstances, and income disproportionately impact refugees. This paper identifies these factors as the root causes of refugee's Homelessness. Homelessness can also cause some issues with these six factors in general. In fact, there is a bidirectional causation relationship between Homelessness and these factors to some degree. However, the focus of this paper is on how these factors can contribute to refugee homelessness.

AB  - In the last two decades, the incorporation of green roofs and living walls in buildings has increased significantly worldwide because of their benefits such as building energy savings, promoting biodiversity, controlling water run-off, mitigating urban heat island effect, improving indoor and urban air quality, and connecting people with nature. However, few studies have quantified the impact of green roofs (GRs) and living walls (LWs) on mitigating air pollution, especially in semiarid climates where airborne particle matter (PM) levels are high. Therefore, the aim of this paper is quantifying the dry deposition of PM10 and PM2.5 by several vegetation species commonly used in GRs and LWs in semiarid climates. Five species (Pitosporum tobira, Lavandula angustifolia, Lampranthus spectabillis, Sedum album, and Sedum reflexum) for GRs and four species (Aptenia cordiflora, Erigeron karvinskianus, Sedum palmeri, and Sedum spurium p.) for LWs were tested in an experimental facility-through washing, filtering, and weighing-to quantify the dry deposition of PM2.5 and PM10 on vegetation leaves as well as PM captured by the leaf wax. The main result is that a significant amount of PM is deposited on the typical vegetation used in GRs and LWs in semiarid climates. However, large differences in PM dry deposition were found among species, ranging from 0.09 mu g/cm(2).h(-1) to 1.32 mu g/cm(2).h(-1) for PM2.5, 0.48 mu g/cm(2).h(-1) to 4.7 mu g/cm(2).h(-1) for PM10 and 0.41 mu g/cm(2).h(-1) to 25.6 mu g/cm(2).h(-1) for leaf wax. The species that showed the highest potential to capture PM were S. album, S. reflexum, S. palmeri, and L. spectabillis. This study shows this green infrastructures can contribute to mitigate air pollution, thus GRs and LWs have the potential for being included in decontamination plans.

AB  - The Australian home is embedded within social norms that align the ideal dwelling with the large detached suburban house and mass-consumption. In this paper, we present a Foucauldian discourse analysis of Australian electronic media representations of the tiny house to better understand how this dwelling type might challenge the normalisation of the Australian dream home. Our analysis suggests that the tiny house is a crucial site both for contesting and normalising sets of ideas that constitute the Australian dream home. Those advocating for tiny house living tap into narratives of 'less is more' and 'debt free living' that trouble dominant Australian housing social norms by generating material spaces that suggest affinities with affordability, slower-paced off-grid living, and enhanced sustainability. Yet, the electronic media representation of the tiny house simultaneously reproduces dominant housing social norms around luxury (even 'in nature') and a still unfettered material consumption. To conclude we draw out the broad implications of these contradictory media representations of the tiny house for Australian planners.

AB  - China's housing sector has a major impact on global energy consumption due to the rapid urbanization. Although the Chinese government launched a wide variety of policies to encourage green building practices, only 1592 housing projects had been green-certified by the end of 2015, representing a small percentage in China's booming housing market and with very uneven distribution across cities. Based on a panel dataset of all the cities at the prefecture level or above in China for the period from 2008 to 2015, this paper employs Tobit model and Cox proportional hazard model to investigate the drivers of green housing development. Besides the factors associated with economic returns to green investment, the empirical results suggest that some policy instruments have effectively stimulated green practices in the private housing sector, such as land-related policies, priority in enterprise qualification inspection and upgrade, and demand-side subsidies. This paper also highlights the spillover effects of the government's green practices in public housing, implying that governments can also influence the building sector as leading actors. These findings could help governments create more effective and efficient policies to boost green housing development.

AB  - The emergence and expansion of the digitally mediated, short-term rental (STR) market in Athens underplayed a key role in the rising inaccessibility to affordable housing, interrelating with broader transformations of the housing landscape, including i) the translation of the economic crisis into a housing one, ii) the unfolding of touristification processes in central Athenian districts and iii) the increased involvement of international investors and funds in the real estate market. In this paper, we bring out the role of STRs in the commodification and financialisation of housing and the unfolding of touristification processes in central Athens. We delineate the aforementioned developments as a series of successive waves, arguing that the STR market initially enabled the commodification of housing through its disassociation from the sphere of households' social reproduction and its assetisation, facilitating the engagement of domestic and foreign investors and the association of the housing landscape with financial flows.

AB  - In September 2022, Hurricane Ian made landfall in southwest Florida, causing an estimated $67 billion in damage and the loss of almost 150 lives. Before this date, demand and house prices in this area were rising faster than anywhere else in the country. What did homeowners in southwest Florida believe about flood risk to their own homes, and what did real estate agents believe about the role of flood risk in the residential housing market? The survey research summarized in this article shows that not only did residents feel that they were not particularly at risk from flooding, but also that damaging floods would not affect future home values in their neighborhoods or for their own homes. We found that political party affiliation was strongly correlated with the direction and strength of these beliefs. Real estate agents also reported strong demand for low-elevation coastal housing, noting that coastal lifestyle outweighed the prospect of flooding in residential decision-making. They also observed that the detailed maps of flood risk that are now available at realtor.com for anyone browsing for houses for sale had no effect on homebuyers, and that most of their customers were generally unconcerned with flood risk.

AB  - While the association between perceived discrimination and health has been investigated, little is known about whether and how neighborhood characteristics moderate this association. We situate discrimination in the housing context and use relative deprivation and social capital perspectives to fill the knowledge gap. We applied multilevel logistic modeling to 9,842 adults in 830 neighborhoods in Philadelphia to examine three hypotheses. First, the detrimental effect of discrimination on self-reported health was underestimated without considering neighborhood features as moderators. The estimated coefficient (beta) increased from approximately 0.02 to 1.84 or higher. Second, the negative association between discrimination and self-reported health was enhanced when individuals with discrimination experience lived in neighborhoods with higher housing values (beta = 0.42). Third, the adverse association of discrimination with self-reported health was attenuated when people reporting discrimination resided in neighborhoods marked by higher income inequality (beta = -4.34) and higher concentrations of single-parent households with children (beta = -0.03) and minorities (beta = -0.01). We not only confirmed the moderating roles of neighborhood characteristics, but also suggested that the relative deprivation and social capital perspectives could be used to understand how perceived housing discrimination affects self-reported health via neighborhood factors.

AB  - Housing policy changes in the Netherlands have been in line with OECD and IMF policy advice to increase market dynamism by downsizing the large social rental sector. The impact of such policies on households, however, is rarely acknowledged. Therefore, in this article, distributive effects on social housing tenants in Amsterdam between 2004 and 2014 are evaluated against two standards for distributive justice: sufficiency and priority. These standards befit the policy aim to provide adequate (sufficient) housing for households with a certain need (priority). The analysis shows housing policies have amplified the impacts of the global financial crisis on households. The occurrence of sufficiency increased significantly until 2008, but decreased thereafter. In regards of the priority standard more households with a significant need benefitted from social housing after 2008. However, many of these households still do not meet the sufficiency threshold. While spatial patterns remained rather stable, the impact has been greater in the areas with already relatively low residual incomes.

AB  - The ideology of Passivhaus is clear. It is a building standard associated with a really well insulated and airtight building that saves energy - in both hot and cold climates. There is evidence from that shows how important this approach to building is in achieving carbon reduction targets. Passivhaus is a credible way for large scale energy reduction in the built environment and has gained in popularity with policy makers tasked with meeting the internationally agreed climate change targets. The reality of living in a Passivhaus is not so clear. There is evidence of some Passivhaus projects using much more energy than the design models anticipate. There is also emerging evidence of the difficulties some people face in living in a Passivhaus. Issues of air quality, systems control problems, inadequate technical knowledge and skills. While the overall picture is positive there are clearly issues to be overcome in the delivery of a promising carbon reduction strategy for the built environment. This research explores the limitation of the PHPP software in addressing the lived experience of Passivhaus. The emerging issues with some PH projects suggest a better understanding of the interactions between people and the building is required.

AB  - Glazing transparency provides buildings with valuable solar energy during periods of colder weather, thus contributing to the mitigation of climate change. However, this same transparency also leads to heat loss which can offset heat gains. Although the use of insulated glazing addresses this challenge by multiplying the number of glass panes, at the same time it reduces the solar factor and thus the heating potential. This article aims to estimate the potential for passive solar heating in Europe according to the energy performance of glazing. This potential is undoubtedly a valuable resource for sustainable architecture. However, an analysis based on regional weather conditions shows a wide disparity in the energy savings that can be expected from a south-facing facade. These savings are most often well below a building's average energy consumption and so a balance has to be found between the thermal resistance and the solar factor of glazing. In addition, the carbon footprint and cost of the most efficient glazing can considerably extend the environmental and economic payback time of a retrofit. This research shows that the potential for passive solar heating is significant but only as long as each architectural situation is analysed according to its specific context and function. This potential would be even greater if windows were designed and used as adjustable facade elements to suit variations in weather and use. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tulou is a traditional Hakka building form in Fujian, southeast China, mostly built between the 12th and 20th centuries. Usually occupied by clans, it has circular or square configuration built with thick rammed earth walls surrounding a central shrine. They have been praised for their thermal comfort, defensibility and communality. While the climate in Fujian is humid subtropical climate with long, hot and humid summers, Tulou responds to this climate, creating a mild microclimate inside. This paper presents a study based on fieldwork carried to investigate the impact of passive cooling strategies of Tulou. The main findings of the study highlight the importance of the courtyard configuration, the roof design, materiality and the benefits of thermal inertia as well as solar control strategies, all of which with great potential to be applied in modern buildings in this area.

AB  - In urban sustainability, passive cooling energy systems are recognised as primary design factors that highlight efficient and performative buildings. In the literature, there is a gap in addressing these design systems in the form of strategies that holistically suggest sustainable energy systems, cleaner built environments, and urban sustainability. This study fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive SWOT analysis of all major passive cooling energy systems. In doing so, the study highlights key implications from a multi-indicator perspective comprised of five primary indicators, 'energy', 'policy', 'practice', 'health', and 'environment'. These indicators are significant for disciplines of sustainable energy systems and the built environment. Through an in-depth interdependency evaluation of these indicators, this study assesses the passive energy systems across three spatial levels of macro, meso, and micro. Finally, this paper provides a holistic overview of these sustainable energy systems from the policy and practice perspectives across the three spatial levels.

AB  - Local and global climate change increases the ambient temperature of cities by several degrees with important consequences on energy consumption, health and the economy. Advanced urban mitigation technologies contribute to decrease the ambient temperature and counterbalance the impact of urban heat islands. The present paper analyses and presents in a comparative way the mitigation potential of the known mitigation technologies using performance data from about 220 real scale urban rehabilitation projects. The average and peak temperature drop of reflective technologies, greenery, evaporative systems, earth to air heat exchangers and their combinations is calculated and presented. The mitigation potential of the main systems like cool roofs, cool pavements, green roofs, urban trees, pools and ponds, sprinklers, fountains, and evaporative towers, is analysed. It is found that the potential of the main mitigation technologies is considerable and can counterbalance UHI effects partly or fully. The average peak temperature drop calculated for all projects is close to 2 K, while the corresponding decrease of the average ambient temperature is close to 0.74 K. Almost 31% of the analysed projects resulted in a peak temperature drop below 1 K, 62% below 2 K, 82% below 3 K and 90% below 4 K. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article proposes to systematize three different approaches for addressing participatory instances in architecture, enabling interventions in the built environment through dialogue between professionals and neighbors. In order to clarify these approaches, the theoretical proposals of three architects who laid the foundations for participation in the design disciplines during the 1960s and 1970s will be referenced: John Turner, Nicholas John Habraken and Christopher Alexander. While the contributions of these authors are generally recognized as foundational concepts in participatory architecture, this paper aims to interpret their writings through a methodological view in order to achieve not only a defense of user participation, but also different paths to implement it. In presenting the results, the various approaches are systematized according to their methodological elements (roles of professionals and residents, stages, and instruments). The discussion addresses the conceptual background of each proposal and the conclusions include a series of recommendations to guide methodological decisions in future participatory interventions based on contextual requirements and the professional practice perspectives.

AB  - With the increasing of building energy consumptions, the related issues of energy crisis and environmental pollution become more and more prominent. As an effective energy-saving technology, the passive house (PH) has been widely applied in China to reduce the building energy utilization. However, the design and application of PH vary with different climate conditions. Therefore, it is significant to conduct the parameterization of PH and propose a suitable design zoning of PH in China. In our study, a comprehensive feasibility analysis of the implementation of PH is performed, which chooses 31 representative cities covering 5 climatic regions. The sensitivity analysis firstly filters the key parameters that heavily affect energy consumption. The results indicate that the key parameters include external wall heat transfer coefficient (WU), basement ceiling heat transfer coefficient (BCU), solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC), glass G value (UG), heat recovery efficiency (HERE) and humidity recovery efficiency (HURE). Then, with the multiple regression approach, the values of key parameters are optimized. Based on the determined values of sensitive parameters, the design zoning of PH in China is finally proposed, which can guide the design of PH as well as enhance the application of PH in China.

AB  - This paper explores the housing experiences of amenity migrants, focusing on the challenges of rental housing insecurity in Cairns, Australia. Through episodic narrative interviews with a purposive sample of 27 amenity migrants who moved to Cairns between 2016 and 2021, we explore how housing insecurity affects their life satisfaction and consider the implications for urban planning and policy. Our findings reveal that many amenity migrants in Cairns face significant challenges in navigating the rental housing market, which negatively impacts their sense of belonging and overall life satisfaction. Participants reported struggles with rental housing affordability, suitability, and availability, which often led to compromises in their living conditions and a sense of frustration and uncertainty. These challenges were found to have significant impacts on their mental well-being, social integration, and overall quality of life. Importantly, the study reveals that housing insecurity can prompt amenity migrants to consider re-migration as a coping strategy, as they seek more stable and affordable housing options elsewhere. We argue that planners must take a proactive role in addressing housing challenges in regional cities like Cairns, through the development of inclusive and responsive housing policies that cater to the diverse needs of amenity migrants.Practitioner PointsRental housing security is a key factor in amenity migrants' satisfaction and integration into new communities.Without affordable, adequate, and appropriate rental housing, amenity migrants choose to 're-migrate' to new destinations, seeking better prospects.Responsive urban planning that addresses the diversity and affordability of rental housing helps meet the needs of amenity migrants.

AB  - Low-income municipal housing and its inhabitants have increasingly been construed as disposable within wider global dynamics of real estate speculation, leading to heightened housing insecurity, displacement and forced evictions. In Western cities urban regeneration programmes have long provided the framework for partial or wholesale demolition of public housing, drawing new frontiers of gentrification and accumulation by dispossession. Before and beyond the material loss of home, the dispossession of low-income housing involves a deeper unmaking of the relations that constitute residents' emplacement and political legitimacy. In this article, I present a thick ethnographic account of multiple registers of dispossession and their implications for resistance through a situated reflection on the process of 'decanting'-as resident rehousing is colloquially known-in a South London council estate, The Heygate. Drawing on participation in an anti-gentrification archive as a scholar-activist, I move beyond issues of displacement and grief to analyse three key mechanisms that make becoming dispossessed possible: disowning, disavowal and the administration of differential disposability. Within a resurgent interest in municipal solutions to housing crises, there is an urgent need for understanding municipal dispossession and the role of residents and engaged scholarship in resisting and expanding imaginaries of housing justice.

AB  - Urban housing is crucial for understanding socioeconomic inequality in transitional economies. In China, since the massive housing privatization, there has been a significant improvement in various aspects of urban housing. Official data and research articles report a substantial increase in urban homeownership rates. However, prevailing studies and media reports also reveal the growing difficulty for young people to attain homeownership. Hence, it is unclear whether it has become easier or harder for Chinese urban residents to become homeowners, and why. We propose differentiating between two types of homeownership: (1) ownership of an urban housing unit (broadly-defined homeownership), and (2) ownership of the housing unit in which one currently lives (narrowly-defined homeownership). The trends of these two types of homeownership rates have diverged since 2008. While the former rose because housing units were increasingly viewed as investment goods, the latter declined, which suggests that for new entrants into the housing market, it has become harder to own their residences. We draw on six waves of the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) between 2003 and 2018 for our empirical investigation. The findings substantiate our propositions. They reveal that young people's disadvantage is more salient in living in self-owned housing units than owning a housing unit, and this disadvantage has grown significantly since 2008. This study contributes to the emerging literature on housing inequality in transitional economies, particularly the housing disadvantages among young adults.

AB  - With the data of housing transaction records of Shanghai during 2004-2015, this paper comprehensively analyzes the housing market in this metropolis, and pays special attention to the market dynamics related to the frequent policy changes. We focus on the secondary market, and build repeat sales indexes. Then the AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model is applied to estimate the weight of housing consumption incentives relative to investment incentives. It turns out that the overall market features strong consumption incentives, especially in the suburb area. Moreover, the market tends to overreact to policy changes. Compared with the suburb area, downtown features more investment incentives, lower returns and volatility, and less overreaction to policy changes. We infer that long-term investors overreact less than consumers. Finally, the purchase restriction policy and the issue of non-local buyers are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Highly insulated and airtight homes designed to reduce energy consumption are perceived as having a greater summer overheating risk than less insulated homes. If true, dwellings built to the well-known low-energy Passivhaus (PH) standard could be at greatest risk due to the use of superinsulation, especially as the climate warms. Existing studies are inconclusive and even contradictory, mainly due to small sample sizes. Hence, this paper presents the first large-scale overheating risk analysis of UK Passivhaus dwellings using high-resolution internal temperature data from 82 homes across the UK. Both the Passivhaus and the recently published Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers TM59 criteria are analysed. Results show that the whole-dwelling Passivhaus standard, which uses a fixed temperature threshold, is met more frequently (83%) than when applied on a room-by-room basis (e.g. only 60% of bedrooms in houses meet the standard). TM59-1A, which uses an adaptive temperature threshold, is easier to meet with 100% of flats and 82% of houses in compliance. However, 55% of bedrooms assessed under TM59-1B fail, with little difference between flats and houses. This is a remarkable finding given that the summers under consideration were either typically mild or cooler than average, and that sleep impairment can significantly affect both physical and mental health. These results suggest that highly insulated dwellings such as Passivhaus should consider overheating in individual rooms, rather than at whole-dwelling level. Analysis should be undertaken throughout the year with particular attention to bedrooms, using either the good-practice PH-5% exceedance threshold which maps well to TM59-1B, or TM59-1B itself.

AB  - One of the early objectives of high-density low-cost flat housing is to overcome the squatter problems in urban areas such as in Kuala Lumpur. As the country progresses towards being a developed nation, the quality and standard of living of its people have also improved. Low-cost flat housing initiative has also gone through changes to provide better living quality. This paper discusses on the occupants' satisfaction perception of outdoor environmental quality (OEQ) of a selected high-density low-cost flat housing located in the state of Selangor in Malaysia. The objective of the paper is to obtain the level of perception by the occupants of low-cost flats on the OEQ. The methodologies used in this study are site observation and questionnaire survey. This study found that the OEQ in the low-cost flat has generally fulfilled the five out of 6 elements of OEQ. The only element that found to have poor perception is the level of safety.

AB  - This article examines the impacts of urban consolidation and apartment living on households with children in the contexts of housing choice and affordability, liveability, and children's spontaneous outdoor play through a case study in the Lane Cove LGA, Sydney. It challenges ideals and planning presumptions built into urban consolidation, and the current approach to housing provision based on 'housing targets'. The analysis is primarily derived from comparative qualitative resident interviews, supplemented by fieldwork and policy analysis. Findings suggest that urban consolidation in its current form effectively works against households with children directly and indirectly, with various flow-on effects. It is suggested a reframing is required, particularly in the context of housing diversity, in order to significantly improve outcomes for this household type.

AB  - Energy communities (ECs) are becoming increasingly common entities in power distribution networks. To promote local consumption of renewable energy sources, governments are supporting members of ECs with strong incentives on shared electricity. This policy encourages investments in the residential sector for building retrofit interventions and technical equipment renovations. In this paper, a general EC is modeled as an energy hub, which is deemed as a multi-energy system where different energy carriers are converted or stored to meet the building energy needs. Following the standardized matrix modeling approach, this paper introduces a novel methodology that aims at jointly identifying both optimal investments (planning) and optimal management strategies (operation) to supply the EC's energy demand in the most convenient way under the current economic framework and policies. Optimal planning and operating results of five refurbishment cases for a real multi-family building are found and discussed, both in terms of overall cost and environmental impact. Simulation results verify that investing in building thermal efficiency leads to progressive electrification of end uses. It is demonstrated that the combination of improvements on building envelope thermal performances, photovoltaic (PV) generation, and heat pump results to be the most convenient refurbishment investment, allowing a 28% overall cost reduction compared to the benchmark scenario. Furthermore, incentives on shared electricity prove to stimulate higher renewable energy source (RES) penetration, reaching a significant reduction of emissions due to decreased net energy import.

AB  - In recent decades U.S. households have experienced residential house prices moving persistently, that is, returns being positively serially correlated. We set up a realistically calibrated life cycle model with slow-moving time variation in expected housing returns, showing that not only age, labor income, and pre-existing housing wealth but also the state of the housing market significantly affect household decisions. Consistently with the data, the model predicts that in good states of housing market cycles (1) homeownership rates increase, (2) households buying homes invest a larger share of their net worth in their home, and (3) these households lever up more.

AB  - We provide empirical evidence on the heterogeneous transmission of monetary policy to the housing market across and within countries. We use household-level data from Germany, Italy and Switzerland together with the respective monetary policy shocks identified from high frequency data. We find that the pass-through of monetary policy shocks to rates of newly originated (fixed-rate) mortgages is twice as strong in Switzerland as in Germany and Italy. After an accommodative monetary policy shock, this is associated in the housing market with a larger immediate, and persistent increase of transitions from renting to owning; a stronger decrease in rents; and an increase of the price-rent ratio. Within Italy, we find a stronger pass through to mortgage rates, housing tenure transitions and the price-rent ratio in the northern regions that have been characterized in the literature as more financially developed than the southern regions.

AB  - Temperate zones including the UK and mainland Europe continue to be exposed to increasing temperatures and more frequent heatwaves as global warming continues. The built environment can mitigate the public health risk of overheating and recommendations for precautionary actions on homes have been published by government and industry. A key player in improving resilience is the householder, who can determine whether precautionary measures will be installed in their home. Previous research on flooding has applied Protection Motivation Theory to examine determinants of householder response to risk. However, flooding risks differ from those of overheating in several ways. The current study builds on this work to address the gap on understanding householder propensity to install precautionary measures against overheating. A large-scale survey (n = 1007) of householders was conducted in the south of England and regression analyses applied to the data. While threat appraisal (perception of threat risk and severity) had an influence on motivation to take action, coping appraisal (perception of ability to make changes, of the effectiveness of the changes and of convenience) was a stronger predictor, particularly for flat dwellers. Previous experience of overheating did not directly influence protection motivation. Age was negatively related to intentions to act but income was not a significant factor. Recommendations for policy and practice include focusing on enhancing coping appraisal, targeting older citizens, customising initiatives by type of property and occupancy, and framing mitigating actions in ways other than protection from overheating.

AB  - Purpose Feedback from condominium occupants on multi-generational condominium facility services makes it possible to identify areas in need of improvement and development concerning facilities management in this residential project type. This paper aims to examine behaviours, needs, preferences and patterns of space use in condominium occupants from three different age groups (under 30, 30 to 50 and over 50 years old) relative to their satisfaction with facility services. The paper examines the impact of the physical environment and facility service arrangement (i.e. cleaning and security) on occupant satisfaction in the common areas of six multi-generational condominiums and investigates whether occupant satisfaction varies between the three age groups. Design/methodology/approach Six case studies classified as multi-generational condominiums were conducted. Research methods included document analysis, field surveys, interviews with juristic person managers and surveys from condominium occupants regarding their satisfaction with cleaning and security services in the common areas. The findings were then applied one-way ANOVA to test occupant satisfaction mean differences between age groups. Findings The findings indicate that physical environment characteristics including the location, size, number and design attributes of common areas have an impact on the provision of facility services and may influence occupant satisfaction. In terms of the facility service arrangement, both the service method and the ratio of staff to areas of responsibility can be explained in connection to functional and technical quality, respectively. Occupants' demands and behaviours, such as the strong requirement for privacy, the preference towards service staff accessibility and the frequency of space usage, contribute to different levels of occupant satisfaction. Research limitations/implications More case studies in Thailand and also in other countries, based on surveys with large samples of respondents, are required to increase the validity and to establish whether it is possible to generalise the study's findings. Practical implications The findings and reflections upon them help understand the impact of physical environment characteristics and the provision of facility services on occupant satisfaction in various age groups. Recommendations are provided concerning building design and the provision of facility services in connection to perceived service quality and occupant satisfaction in multi-generational condominiums in Thailand that can apply to other types of real estate projects where similar facility services are offered. Originality/value This paper contributes to research on occupant satisfaction with facility services and provides evidence on occupants' feedback in different types of perceived service quality (i.e. technical and functional quality). Identifying the impact of physical environment characteristics, facility service arrangements and occupant behaviours on occupant satisfaction with the technical and functional aspects of facility services contributes to the body of research on facilities management.

AB  - Occupant behaviour is known to be one of the key sources of uncertainty in the prediction of building energy use. Extended literature reviews linked the large performance gaps between residential buildings with same properties and similar climate conditions to the way occupants interact with the building envelope and systems. Furthermore, in the last decades, more stringent energy codes have led to energy efficient design strategies with the aim of reaching the nearly-zero energy target. The success of these strategies is now heavily dependent on how the occupants interact with the building, or rather, on the energy-related lifestyles they assume. In line with this, the present study employs building simulations to demonstrate the potential impact of different occupant behaviour lifestyles on the energy use of a Mediterranean (i) residential nearly-zero energy building (nZEB) under construction and a (ii) Reference Building (RB) whose envelope-driven loads dominate the consumption profile.

AB  - Occupant behavior is now widely recognized as a major contributing factor to uncertainty of building performance. While a surge of research on the topic has occurred over the past four decades, and particularly the past few years, there are many gaps in knowledge and limitations to current methodologies. This paper outlines the state-of-the-art research, current obstacles and future needs and directions for the following four-step iterative process: (1) occupant monitoring and data collection, (2) model development, (3) model evaluation, and (4) model implementation into building simulation tools. Major themes include the need for greater rigor in experimental methodologies; detailed, honest, and candid reporting of methods and results; and development of an efficient means to implement occupant behavior models and integrate them into building energy modeling programs.

AB  - This study builds on previous research to understand longer term housing experiences in late adolescence and early adulthood for vulnerable college students. Using a biographical, qualitative method, we study high school and college housing and family circumstances for 27 students with homelessness or foster care experience enrolled in 4-year colleges in Georgia. We identified three different housing pathway types in high school-family homelessness, unaccompanied youth and foster care. Housing instability and frequent moves were common in high school among all housing pathway types. In college, students who were able to find low or no-cost housing and those who identified a foster care pathway in high school achieved greater housing stability. Others students experienced a continuation of housing instability that began in high school. Additional funding to cover the cost of on-campus housing would likely contribute to increased stability. Additional strategies, such as rental assistance programmes tailored for college students, may be needed to address housing instability for vulnerable college students. More research on the unmet housing needs and the consequences of housing instability during college for homeless and foster youth is needed to further a housing policy agenda that focuses on practical solutions.

AB  - The market share of social housing is around 6 % in Switzerland, while it amounts to an average of 11 % across the countries of the EU-28. Between the countries, big differences in market shares and support schemes for social housing exist. This paper investigates these characteristics of social housing in Europe as well as its trends in the recent years. The situation of social housing in Switzerland in the European context is highlighted - with a special focus to the aspect of inward urban development. It is shown, that market shares of social housing are generally declining in Europe. Parallely, there has been a shift from bricks and mortar subsidies towards housing allowances and a focus on clearer targetting of the remaining social housing stock towards those most in need. While this can be seen as a necessity to reach a high effectiveness of social housing, it has led to an increased concentration of economically and socially disadvantaged people in the remaining housing stock, raising concerns about ghettoisation that contradict the housing paradigm of socially mixed neighbourhoods. In Switzerland, social housing is partly clearly targeted at certain population parts (continously subsidized housing), but partly also open for all people (mostly social cooperative housing). This raises questions about the fair distribution of public housing subsidies, but also reflects the large variety of different social housing providers in the country. Moreover - linking the subject of social housing and spatial planning - it is shown, that social housing providers play an important role in the national spatial strategy of inward urban development. Using the example of the city of Zurich, which has the biggest social housing market share (24 %) of any Swiss municipality, success factors in this regard are examined. It is detected, that a continous cooperation between the city authorities and social housing providers is a key factor for a succesful linkage of housing policies with urban development. The strategy builds upon a set of housing support measures from the city with clear requirements for compensatory measures by the social housing providers that further the quality and effectiveness of social housing projects.

AB  - As the housing affordability crisis strikes many cities around the world, public institutions and citizens have started to become aware of growing problems in the access to adequate affordable housing. The issue is particularly evident in Milan, where increased attractiveness is paralleled by a huge rise in housing prices. This article presents the results of research conducted by the Affordable Housing Observatory of Milan, contributing to public knowledge on housing affordability problems and envisioning possible policies to tackle them. Housing issues are contested and political in nature, and in the Italian context the debate is often led by the voice of the real estate sector while data are highly fragmented and knowledge about housing affordability is limited, especially in Milan. We fill this gap by conducting an original analysis of existing public data on the housing market, the labour market and incomes to highlight the trends in housing affordability in Milan. We focus on the period starting in 2015, a turning point for Milan with the international EXPO and the beginning of an intense phase of urban transformation and real estate development. The article shows how the increase in housing prices and rents has outpaced growth in incomes and wages by nearly a factor of three and how a major share of income earners in Milan cannot afford decent housing. These trends expose lower-income residents to the risk of expulsion and condition access to a job in the city to ownership of assets or financial assistance from parents (especially for first-time buyers and the younger generations). Finally, the article reflects on the implications of growing unaffordability with reference to policies targeting housing costs, incomes, and wages.

AB  - Every few years the planning agencies in the Netherlands draw up a prognosis for the future housing needs on the basis of economic and demographic scenarios. It is our contention that, in applying this approach, the agencies neglect to take sufficient account of the influence of cultural dynamics. Against this background, a recent recommendatory report by the Dutch Council for Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM-road 2009) drew attention to three socio-cultural trends which are currently manifesting themselves on the Dutch housing market: 1. A growing interest in living with like-minded people and in common-interest housing concepts; 2. The rise of transnational living (permanently or temporarily living abroad) and people having multiple residences; 3. An increasing mix of housing and other functions and services (care, energy, leisure, retail), which is opening up the housing market for new players. This contribution explores the background and the expressions of these three trends that will have a significant influence on the demand for housing in the future, in spatial terms as well as with regard to quantity and quality. It turns out that the trends raise new dilemmas in spatial planning and housing policy. In order to solve these dilemmas, a different way of thinking is needed.

AB  - Scholarly debates concerning the transformation of clientelism have rarely focused on everyday life in urban China. This ethnographic study in Nanjing city attempted to characterize the new patterns of patron-client ties by examining how real estate investors evade unfavorable rules and multiple layers of 'authorities', such as local governments, banks, and state-owned developers, offer or withdraw their support. The article highlights a new clientelism that differs from Chinese guanxi and old clientelism. The new form is broker-based, where new patrons and clients no longer interact directly but exchange through brokers. Brokers act as 'white gloves' for new patrons to maximize profit and security and as temporary bridges for clients to access patronage resources. Brokers are highly specialized, and their relationships with clients are not sentimental but instrumental, unlike zhongjian ren in guanxi. The emerging broker-based clientelistic networks reinforce inequality of opportunity but not necessarily economic inequality. Implications for understanding power and the housing system in contemporary China are discussed.

AB  - Housing, employment and economic conditions in many nations have changed greatly over the past decades. This paper explores the ways in which changing housing markets, economic conditions and government policies have affected vulnerable individuals and households, using Australia as a case study. The paper finds a substantial number and proportion of low income Australians have been affected by housing and employment that is insecure with profound implications for vulnerability. Importantly, the paper suggests that in Australia the economic gains achieved as a consequence of mining-related growth in the early 2000s were translated as greater employment security for some on low incomes, but not all. Enhanced access to employment in this period was differentiated by gender, with women largely missing out on the growth in jobs. For the population as a whole, employment gains were offset by increased housing insecurity as accommodation costs rose. The paper finds low income lone parents were especially vulnerable because they were unable to benefit from a buoyant labour market over the decade 2000-2010. They were also adversely affected by national policy changes intended to encourage engagement with paid work. The outcomes identified for Australia are likely to have been mirrored in other nations, especially those that have embraced, or been forced to adopt, more restrictive welfare and income support regimes.

AB  - It is a well-known fact that the built environment in Europe is responsible for approximately 40% of the overall energy end usage and that this has to be reduced drastically for the building stock to be sustainable in the long term. A prerequisite to meet the EU 2020 and 2030 targets is significantly increased ambition among property owners regarding energy-efficient renovation. However, it is not easy to regulate that large-scale energy-efficiency measures should be included in the ordinary renovation of buildings. In order to design the right policy instruments to influence property owners towards energy-efficiency-oriented renovation, deeper knowledge is needed on how property owners act and argue today. This study reviews several recently performed studies with the aim of obtaining an overview of how the decision-making process is conducted, and it makes comparisons between different categories of buildings. The aim is to allow conclusions to be drawn on whether a financial incentive is important to bringing about energy-efficiency renovation and, if so, how such an incentive should be formulated. The study shows that direct and simple subsidies are needed to bring about major energy-efficiency improvements in housing in connection with renovations, especially when it comes to additional insulation for facades. For non-residential property, there is little need for financial support, while other forms of support are needed. Current energy-efficiency improvements in connection with renovations are modest and a long way off the technical potential.

AB  - Studies of energy poverty have proliferated around the world. While the existing literature provides significant insights into the drivers and dynamics of energy poverty in some parts of the world, there remains little evidence from Asia - a region that combines rapidly changing developed urban conurbations alongside widespread rural poverty. This paper explores a case study of energy poverty in Hong Kong a global city with high levels of inequality and housing precarity. To date, there has been no published academic work on this topic in the Hong Kong context, and little work in urban Asia. This paper draws on documentary analyses and interviews to present three narratives around the emergence and manifestation of energy poverty in Hong Kong: (a) energy systems, markets and policy (b) urban poverty and inequality and (c) energy services and cooling. By reading energy poverty 'through the city', the paper emphasises the importance of geographically sensitive accounts and proposes an agenda for future research. It thus enables the study of energy poverty to be productively pursued in the context of Hong Kong and urban Asia more broadly. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Institutional inequality has created an environment in which our physical surroundings reflect racial and economic biases - causing inequitable thermal comfort and energy consumption across neighborhoods. Just as energy and thermal comfort challenges are unique to each climate and built environment, the solutions to address these issues should be optimized for their context. We introduce a novel integrated data-driven and building energy simulation method that incorporates urban context, satellite imagery, and socioeconomic data to analyze multi-scale retrofit scenarios across disparate communities. We apply this method to case studies in New York City and Los Angeles to analyze energy and thermal comfort inequities across distinct climate zones and urban morphologies. Through parametric analysis, we demonstrate the efficacy of multi-scale retrofits at improving building performance and reducing existing thermal inequities. Our research shows that retrofit effectiveness is influenced by the microclimatic changes induced by the urban context and existing infrastructural inequity. For example, instantaneous building cooling energy demand in a disadvantaged community of Los Angeles is reduced more due to window retrofits (around 30 kWh) than by a greenspace retrofit (around 3 kWh). Greenspace installation dissipates more heat overnight and in the early morning, whereas window retrofits reduce solar heat gain during the day, showing the different heat reduction pathways that retrofits can achieve. Although the window retrofits lead to an order of magnitude higher utility cost savings ($70 savings from windows vs $9 for greenspace and $12 for reduced cars), the district-scale retrofits show promising pathways for reducing the cost burden across all residents. We also analyze pathways for achieving city-specific CO2 reduction targets and find that building-level retrofits are most effective at meeting building performance standards (reducing CO2 by 40%), whereas district-level retrofits should be used to achieve city-scale climate goals because of the sequestered and abated emissions offered by these pathways. This generalizable modeling framework empowers policymakers, urban planners, and building owners around the world to analyze pathways for meeting their climate action plan goals by reducing extreme heat, reducing greenhouse emissions, and reducing energy cost burden while improving environmental justice in their cities.

AB  - Multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary collaboration (TDC) continue to address complex societal problems such as sustainable development, global environmental change, and public health challenges. Nature-based design (NBD) methods including biomimicry, biomorphism, biophilia, bio-utilization and zoomorphism are essential for the design of the sustainable built environment (SBE). Currently, there is no transdisciplinary collaboration framework (TCF) to support the NBD of the SBE. The first step to fill this gap is through systematically exploring the applications of multidisciplinary research (MDR) in building design and by conducting a case study on the challenges to the MDR in the application of NBD methods for the SBE in the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Science at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK. The systematic literature review and the survey results of academics on MDR collaboration showed a lack of transdisciplinary research (TDR) due to limited communication between disciplines. The research findings showed a lack of communication between academia and the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to advance NBD innovations for the SBE. The findings indicated that a TCF for research on NBD is needed to support knowledge exchange within academia and with industry for reducing the negative impacts of the building industry. Findings from the current research and future research will be used to develop and test a general TCF and then to develop a TCF for the NBD of the SBE aligned with the RIBA Plan of Work.

AB  - Against the backdrop of emerging markets and the transitional society, the large-scale start-up of real estate development projects has brought about rapid economic growth and accelerated urban expansion, followed by extreme disputes between social groups. This paper aims to effectively solve the real dilemma of urban housing expropriation by obtaining a consensus regarding the fairness of compensation standards among expropriation compensation-related subjects. Three behavioral preferences-profit-seeking fairness, loss aversion and interactive fairness-were added to a multidimensional fairness equilibrium evaluation indicator system of urban housing expropriation compensation. The entropy method was used to calculate their weights. A multidimensional fairness game model and a multidimensional fairness equilibrium evaluation method based on compromise multi-criteria decision-making VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) of urban housing expropriation compensation were constructed to combine different strategic schemes of related subjects for the purpose of obtaining the compromise optimal solution, that is, the multidimensional fairness game equilibrium solution. The stability of the multidimensional fairness game model and the objectivity of the multidimensional fairness equilibrium evaluation were tested and verified through case data analysis and sensitivity analysis. The conclusion is drawn that the multidimensional fairness game equilibrium solution can effectively resolve extreme disputes regarding urban housing expropriation.

AB  - Focusing on the evolution of identical single-cohort households concerning their housing service consumption in the life-cycle context, this paper studies the impact of fixed-rate mortgage loans on both the rental and owner-occupied housing markets. Unlike the arbitrarily divided life span usually seen in literature, we "naturally'' divide the household's life cycle into three separate but continuous stages according to their involvement with their mortgage. Then, using inter-stage smoothing conditions, we solve optimal control problems for each life stage. In addition to proposing an implicit method for dealing with durable goods such as housing, we endogenize the housing tenure choice by considering the conversion of a housing renter to a housing owner for a household at different life stages. Our baseline model successfully generates results that are consistent with the empirical evidence. Our numerical comparative statics results reveal the long-run effect of the down-payment ratio, the mortgage interest rate, and the mortgage duration on the equilibrium values of rental housing rate, time for housing purchase, the quantity of housing purchase, and the minimum requirement of housing service to maintain a standard of living. Interpreting these results in terms of homeownership rate, we find that only the mortgage duration positively affects the homeownership rate in the long run.

AB  - Accurate simulation and prediction of occupants' energy use behavior are crucial in building energy consumption research. However, few studies have focused on household energy use behavior in severely cold regions that have unique energy use patterns because of the low demand of cooling in summer and the use of central heating system in winter. Thus, we developed an agent-based model to simulate the household electricity use behavior in severely cold regions, according to data for Harbin, China. The model regards apartments, residents, household appliances, and energy-management departments as agents and generates the household electricity consumption with respect to time, temperature, and energy-saving events. The simulation parameters include basic information of the residents, their energy-saving awareness, their appliance use behaviors, and the impact of energy-saving management. Electricity use patterns are described by decision-making mechanisms and probabilities obtained through a questionnaire survey. In the end, the energy-saving effects of different management strategies are evaluated. The results indicate that the model can visually present and accurately predict the dynamic energy use behavior of residents. The energy-saving potential of household electricity use in severely cold regions is mainly concentrated in lighting and standby waste, rather than cooling and heating, since the cooling demand in summer is low and the heating in winter mainly relies on central heating system of the city, not on household electricity appliances. Energy-saving promotion can significantly reduce the amount of energy waste (41.89% of lighting and 97.79% of standby energy consumption), and the best frequency of promotional events is once every four months. Residents prefer incentive policies, in which energy-saving effect is 57.7% larger than that of increasing electricity prices. This study realized the re-presentation of the changes of energy consumption in a large number of households and highlighted the particularity of household energy-saving potential in severely cold regions. The proposed model has a simple structure and high output accuracy; it can help cities in severely cold regions formulate energy-saving management policies and evaluate their effects.

AB  - To maximize profits without sacrificing quality, the concept of sustainable construction must be adopted across a project's whole lifespan. Although adopting the idea of passive design in developing countries is incomplete, these studies have focused on the reasons for doing so. In contrast, there is limited evidence to completely analyze the influence of integrating passive design on the project sustainable success (PSS) of projects throughout their existence. This study focuses on the hurdles to passive design adoption in Pakistani building projects. It evaluates the impact of overcoming passive design (PD) adoption barriers on project sustainability success (PSS) during the duration of the project. Therefore, a more comprehensive literature assessment is required for conceptual model construction. Using a survey assessment instrument, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was constructed (i.e., a questionnaire). A total of 156 construction experts in Pakistan provided information. The result of the model demonstrated that the elimination of PD implementation obstacles had a moderate to high impact on PSS throughout the building structure's lifetime. These results provide the foundation for legislation in a number of Asian nations about the efficient completion of projects via the removal of obstacles for the use of passive design. Similarly, the adoption of passive design will increase the success of the construction project.

To achieve that aim, the study objectives are to (1) identify critical parameters for assessing the CR of abandoned housing projects; (2) develop underlying constructs to categorize interrelated critical parameters and (3) assess the influence of the underlying constructs on the CR of abandoned housing projects.Design/methodology/approachThis study identifies potential parameters for assessing the CR of abandoned housing projects by reviewing existing literature and interviewing industry professionals. Then, the list was used to develop a questionnaire survey. The collected survey data were analyzed using normalized mean analysis to identify the critical parameters. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to develop underlying constructs to categorize interrelated critical parameters. Finally, the influence of the underlying constructs on the CR of abandoned housing projects was examined through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).FindingsThe analyses suggest that 21 critical parameters are affecting the CR of abandoned housing projects. The critical parameters can be categorized into four underlying constructs: construction site evaluation, management verification, uncertainties mitigation and document approval. Finally, the analyses confirmed that all four constructs affect the CR of abandoned housing projects.Originality/valueThis study is a pioneering effort to quantitatively analyze the parameters for assessing the CR of abandoned housing projects. The findings significantly benefit researchers and industry professionals by providing a list of critical parameters associated with the CR of abandoned housing projects.

AB  - Different housing policies that promote social mixing begin to take shape in Latin America, seeking to restore social cohesion in neighbourhoods. These measures have been criticized in the Anglo-Saxon countries for failing to meet the objective that it proposes, suggesting that the diversity of the neighbourhood is an obstacle to cohesion. This article offers an inter-scalar approach of neighbourhood cohesion and a socio-spatial understanding of its configuration, advancing in five hypotheses that help to understand the effects of social mix policies on the cohesion of neighbourhoods in the region. It concludes with reflections on the applicability of this view on social mixing processes induced by gentrification.

AB  - The neighbourhood of Abasto has been home to many Peruvian immigrants since the 1990s. Now, this population is suffering the effects of a notable increase in real estate value intensely. This work analyses the specific mechanisms that provoke a differentiated exposure of Peruvian neighbours to gentrification, as well as the differentiated responses of migrants to the housing crisis. This paper is an ethnographic account about the strategies developed by Peruvian families in the context of gentrification. For this purpose, an abundance of material collected through observation, in-depth interviews and a rigorous review of bibliographic and documentary material is provided. The results demonstrate how the condition of migrant as in-betweeners represents an overexposure to the effects of the housing crisis for this population. In this context, there is also an unequivocal tendency for migrants to develop autonomous strategies against gentrification.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a measurement model and measure the dimensions of Residential Quality and Housing Adequacy (RQHA), Social Housing Provision (SHP) and Residents' Quality of Life (RQOL) by social housing residents in Batna city, Algeria. Design/methodology/approach This study used a quantitative approach through the distribution of a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 373 useable questionnaires were collected from social housing residents in Batna city and used for the analysis. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis with principal component analysis through SPSS and confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS. Findings The measurement model revealed good fit of indices indicating that RQHA is presented by three sub-constructs, namely satisfaction with housing adequacy, satisfaction with current neighbourhood and satisfaction with housing design. In addition, the constructs of SHP and RQOL were measured by seven items each. The measurement model provides empirical evidence of the correlation between RQHA, SHP and RQOL constructs. Practical implications The findings of this study contribute significantly to government, housing stakeholders, architects, project managers and urban planners in the context of social housing policymakers, design, planning and construction. The finding would be helpful to ameliorate housing quality, adequacy, provision and RQOL in terms of social housing scheme. Originality/value This study identifies the correlation between constructs (RQHA, SHP and RQOL) and their dimensions in the context of social housing in Batna city by validating a measurement model using CFA.

AB  - This dataset contains the material volumes, masses, and intensities for a total of 45 residential building cohorts in Finland from the 1940s to the 2010s. The specific building types included are one dwelling houses and blocks of flats. The data were drawn from representative case buildings and their derivatives. The data are primarily based on construction drawings, complemented by other documents such as bills of materials. The source material was mainly obtained from the archives of the building inspection authority of the city of Vantaa, Finland. Material volumes were derived from the construction drawings either directly from annotations or, when needed, by further measurements made based on the same material. For minor lacks of information in the original documents, documents of similar buildings and literature were consulted. A total of 26 buildings were inventoried directly. For each included combination of building type, construction decade, and bearing material these were the ones with the most common facade material. In addition, 19 buildings with the second most common facade material were formed based on these to represent the 45 cohorts. Material masses, and by extension intensities, were calculated based on the recorded volumes and typical densities of construction materials used in Finland. The material volumes, masses, and intensities per material and in total are presented as three spreadsheet tables, along with a description sheet, on three corresponding hierarchical levels of aggregation: per representative building, per vertical building level (foundations, basement, first storey, etc.), and per building part (floor, exterior walls, interior walls, etc.). Furthermore, they are distinguished between the building structure and complementary building components (windows and doors). The data can be used in academic, policy related, and practical investigations of the building stock, such as in evaluating the material consumption consequences of different spatial planning strategies on various levels or estimating the materials embedded in the built environment and their potential for capitalisation in the circular economy.

AB  - Housing has an important role in the process of human resources development. Housing is also a form of manifestation of an orderly social environment through the internal social interactions. There is a general understanding that the housing sector is one of the sectors that is particularly important with regard to sustainable development. This is because housing embodies social, environmental, as well as economic dimensions. Environmental problems can affect the environmental quality of residential housing. This study aims to assess the level of environmental quality of Sendangmulyo mass housing. The methods of analysis used are quantitative descriptive analysis tools with a frequency distribution and Likert scale. The development of mass housing problems tends to experience a decrease in the quality of the housing environment that may affect sustainability. It has attracted concerns and community involvement in carrying out maintenance and management of residential environment. The results of this research show that the community cohesion in Sendangmulyo depends on social interaction, sense of belonging and community engagement. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB  - This article presents selected findings of a twelve-month-long research project exploring the lived experiences of Maori social housing tenants residing in Otautahi Christchurch. Over the last five years, Aotearoa New Zealand has seen unprecedented social housing demand. There is currently an overrepresentation of Maori experiencing housing need and awaiting placement into social housing, yet studies on this topic are limited. This research narrates the lived experience of Maori social housing tenants. It recounts experiences of social housing placement and explores the interactions tenants have with each other and their surrounding environment to create and maintain a sense of community within their housing placements. This article presents a complex understanding of Maori tenant experience centred on people finding a place to belong. Through utilising a Kaupapa Maori research framework and using semi-structured interviews, this qualitative research describes the process of creating a home as moving beyond the individual house. It highlights how the experience of 'home' for Maori tenants is governed by where you live and with whom you live with. Ultimately, the results presented emphasise the relevance of incorporating a Maori worldview into social housing provision to create environments that support Maori wellbeing.

AB  - Aging is continuously depicted as a force majeure event despite clear and robust premonitions of its coming. However, such depiction serves to justify the unpreparedness and inadequacy of policies manifesting in loneliness and isolation, unsatisfied demands in health and social care, lack of suitably inclusive residential and social facilities, and inequitable access to support and services. Recent years have seen an increase in social innovation that involves alternative transaction models, such as time-banks and circular economies. These initiatives represent collective responses to changes and challenges such as aging by identifying and innovatively capturing and exchanging locally- and freely- available assets with the intent to fulfill economic needs (more affordable goods and services), social ambitions (skills development and exchange, repurposing space, social inclusion, and cohesion) environmental aspirations (up-cycle) and psychological needs (sense of purpose, identity, belonging, recognition). Whilst it is often assumed that ad hoc measures are appropriate to resolve the challenges posed by an aging demographic, the learnt assumption that underpins this work is that aging is a systemic issue and ought to be understood, and resolved, in its context, not by producing niche- relevant policy and interventions, but considering the impacts it has on the whole society. Henceforth it is proposed that truly transformative social innovation for the aging population must consider and resolve the challenges of communities as these are where older adults can stay relevant socially and, in the presented approach, also economically. Through the review of four international case studies, a framework with four cornerstones has emerged. This includes the changing role of local and central governments, the models of value creation, co-creation mechanisms, and finally, technology, especially digital social currency. The concurrent presence of the four factors in the framework is not always a requirement for social innovation to emerge and flourish. However, the presented analysis suggests that all four themes have an impact even when not being direct agents of social innovation. The authors conclude by making a case for developing Living Labs for Aging-in-Place, to experiment and study proposed solutions for systemic challenges facing the aging population, grounded in community-led schemes.

AB  - Housing construction is one of the key fund-forming sectors, on which the formation of the national economy largely depends. The proposed article examines the current problems of financing housing construction in Russia from the perspective of its development, emphasizes the social component, specifically the possible availability of housing for the population. The authors identified the main problems in the field of housing construction related to the imperfection of financial mechanisms, the difficulty of attracting investors and low availability of housing for the population due to its high cost. The analysis of sources of financing was carried out and their classification was developed; advantages and disadvantages of the financing methods of housing which are most often used in the Russian practice were defined. The problems of participatory housing provision as the main way of providing housing finance in the regions were considered. Distinctions of the Russian practice of housing finance from the financing system used abroad have been determined. The gradual withdrawal from participatory housing provision and transition to project financing (the least risky option for some buyers) has been justified. The positive and negative consequences of this step were considered and connected with the possible rise in costs of housing in the primary market. A correlation analysis of the market value of housing was carried out and factors affecting its formation were identified using the example of Chelyabinsk region. Moreover, recommendations were developed to reduce the cost of construction as the main factor affecting the formation of housing prices. The forecast of changes in the price of the residential real estate was made, which allows taking into account any number of factors that affect the base index.

AB  - The private rented sector (PRS) in England has often been described as having a 'residual' role in accommodating low-income households who are unable to gain access to social housing. This paper examines the accuracy of this residual role thesis. It does so using secondary analysis of the 2007 English House Condition Survey. The paper shows that the PRS plays a disproportionately important role in accommodating households living in poverty. It also shows that the odds of being income poor are the same for private tenants as for social housing tenants and three times higher than for owner-occupiers. It is concluded that, as a source of accommodation for low-income households, the role of the private rented sector is not residual at all. In addition, the paper assesses how well accommodated low-income households are in the PRS compared with non-poor private tenants and with low-income households in social housing and owner-occupation.

AB  - In the mid-1990s, one of the main objectives of housing policy in the Netherlands was to stimulate the integration of diverse socio-economic groups through housing strategies, with the goal being to create social cohesion and to address the problems encountered in low-income neighborhoods. Existing literature has studied the impact of social mix policies and policy interventions, concentrating on such outcomes as the spatial consequences of these policies in post-war neighborhoods; macro scale transformations in social mix areas; or shared perceptions of community in gentrifying neighborhoods. Taking a different perspective, this paper studies the impact of such policies at the individual interaction level to assess whether social mix policies can lead to new forms of interaction between the existing residents and newcomers, and consequently, to further cohesion in the area or city from a broader perspective. The paper studies the interaction between new and former neighbors inside out in a special area, Amsterdam Nieuw West neighborhood, Kolenkitbuurt Zuidelijk Veld 1-2, which is recognized as being one of the most deprived neighborhoods in the country. The research of the Kolenkitbuurt case shows clearly that social interactions between the Dutch-Turkish and the new native Dutch residents have been limited to more casual or neither positive nor negative interactions.

AB  - Recent discussions of the geographies of students have drawn attention to the trajectories of UK students electing to leave home for university. While such debates recognise these important mobilities, little has been discussed as to how students interact within their term-time accommodation. Through a qualitative study of the living arrangements of UK students, this paper will demonstrate that much can be drawn from focusing on the micro-geographies of non-local students within their term-time homes. Student accommodation is more than simply somewhere to live. Student homes are intensely dynamic places, perhaps more so than family homes as they contain multiple, disconnected identities. This research contributes to research on the geographies of the home by unpacking how house-sharers in transition interact with each other, how they transfer their identities from one home to another, how they delineate their territory and whether they integrate or withdraw within their term-time accommodation. This paper addresses this by exploring (1) how students negotiate their habitualised behaviours in shared spaces and (2) how these behaviours become spatialised through the configuration and maintenance of boundaries.

AB  - The present paper shows the results of a literature survey aimed at exploring how the indoor environment in buildings affects human comfort. The survey was made to gather data that can be useful when new concepts of controlling the indoor environment are developed. The following indoor environmental conditions influencing comfort in the built environment were surveyed: thermal, visual and acoustic, as well as air quality. The literature was surveyed to determine which of these conditions were ranked by building users as being the most important determinants of comfort. The survey also examined the extent to which other factors unrelated to the indoor environment, such as individual characteristics of building occupants, building-related factors and outdoor climate including seasonal changes, influence whether the indoor environment is evaluated as comfortable or not. The results suggest that when developing systems for controlling the indoor environment, the type of building and outdoor climate, including season, should be taken into account. Providing occupants with the possibility to control the indoor environment improves thermal and visual comfort as well as satisfaction with the air quality. Thermal comfort is ranked by building occupants to be of greater importance compared with visual and acoustic comfort and good air quality. It also seems to influence to a higher degree the overall satisfaction with indoor environmental quality compared with the impact of other indoor environmental conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the sun-shading and building integrated design case of a comprehensive teaching and laboratory building, we investigated the external shading and building integrated design practice in this paper. Indoor light and wind environment as well as energy-saving effects after setting external sun-shading device were analyzed by using simulation software. The results illustrated that the indoor thermal environment and comfort level could be highly improved through reasonable design of external sun-shading while the energy consumption of air conditioners was also reduced. This research offered direct reference for the building sun-shading project and promoted the sun shading and building integration design. Copyright (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change is the most pressing sustainability issue of our time, with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions causing economic, environmental, and human health impacts. We need to achieve net-zero civil infrastructure systems to limit global temperature increases. Energy production and supply, transportation, buildings, and industry are examples of civil infrastructure systems. Examining the full scope of impacts throughout the conception, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of infrastructure systems will allow for improved mitigation and adaptation planning. Current planning processes and mechanisms will need to be transformed to achieve 'climate-smart' infrastructure that focus on thoughtful minimization of impacts, cooperation with communities, and understanding the implications of failing to act. Social equity is often left as an afterthought in environmentally conscious infrastructure planning. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is the most complete and decision-powerful model for cataloging environmental impacts of a system. However, the methodology has limitations regarding how it might be leveraged to support multicriteria decision-making in decarbonizing our civil infrastructure systems, such as when trying to account for community preferences, an important element of a just transition. Future planning for the decarbonization of our built environment would benefit from a multi-criteria approach that encompasses elements of LCA, equity, and stakeholder collaboration, the latter two of which are key tenets for advancing environmental justice.

AB  - The negotiation between the natural and built environment in urban design is one of the more vital aspects facing the practice today. The process of assessing this relationship is facilitated by state-of-the-art simulation toolswhich enable designers to study the ambient qualities of space and associated multivariate effects such as static rays, fluid flows and thermal gradients. These toolsets pave the way toward alternative strategies in urban naturalization, ones that consider the natural and the constructed as part of a shared ecology in lieu of being diametrically opposed. This paper examines the nature of this exchange in high-density urban situations where adequate access to daylight, fresh air, and view sheds are limited due to over-development. The focus of this research resides in Turkey where historical examples dating back three millennia serve as strong examples for cities today where high-density development has undermined the quality of life for metropolitan inhabitants. This paper reviews outcomes from a cross-disciplinary student workshop, funded by the James Marsden Fitch Foundation, carried out over a nineweek period inwesternTurkey. With the use of computer simulation programs, ancient housing typologies including Ephesus, Priene and Pergama are analytically unpacked and played back in the form of design exercises set in Istanbul. During the research period, simulation tools enable the team to disclose design strategies from ancient settlements and test the reintegration of those strategies within new models of collective development.

AB  - Economic restructuring has provided urban officials with a strong incentive to carefully manage downtown land-uses and to prepare land for what Harvey (1985) calls the secondary circuit of capital, investment in the built environment. Many cities have facilitated such investment by eliminating 'Skid Row' areas and low income housing. In Los Angeles, however, an historical compromise preserved Skid Row as an area of very low cost housing and social services for the poor. This paper is a study of homeless policy in Los Angeles and the tension between the social welfare and the land-use objectives of city officials. The analysis shows that despite some successes by advocates for homeless persons, the city has successfully pursued a strategy of physical containment of the homeless, reflecting the land-use objectives of city officials in facilitating downtown revitalization.

At a time of economic crisis, when heritage conservation loses priority in European investment policies, scientific research is called upon to act as a stimulus to communities, not only protecting physical assets, but also preserving practices, histories, and environments, supporting the sense of continuity and identity, for the promotion of a physical regeneration of city centers, able to invest the social and economic dimensions. Design/methodology/approach - With the support of a case study, the paper describes the impact of technological transfer to anticipate the degradation processes in outdoor collective spaces. Taking into account the historic center of Salerno, the paper discusses an urban regeneration experience based on remote monitoring and permanent maintenance with innovative technologies. Thanks to a synergy between the University and the Superintendence, knowledge and innovation become motors of active protection and development with the creation of a laboratory of urban sustainability. The paper identifies a knowledge based approach as the means to promote outdoor spaces identity, with the affirmation of inner inherent dynamism, internal and external connection. Originality/value - knowledge based active protection is here identified with a process of anticipation, vigilance and planning of vulnerabilities, informed to the logic of responsibility sharing between users and managers, coordinating design choices. Condition for an active protection is the complementarily of information, experience and expertise, for the preservation and promotion of the built capital. Reconciling multi-scalar and multi-sector approaches, active protection brings into play an idea of the settlement as an interconnected system, where design scenarios arise from the complexity of the relationships between spaces, performances and instances. The awareness of users, creating a sense of ownership, are conditions to support these processes, acting on the components of identity, heritage and memory. Practical implications - Echoing the vision of UNESCO creative cities, the paper offers an application scenario in which knowledge and innovation can become engines of social, economic and physical regeneration. Through the creation of a sustainability laboratory, knowledge and skills are put into sharing, to counter the aging processes, through transfer, analyzing, planning and testing. The paper discusses the role of creativity in the knowledge-based development scenario for ancient outdoor collective spaces, focusing on the extent to which culture enables cities to perform new tasks, in a process where innovation is supposed to be the medium to enrich society, building identities, adding value to heritage, strengthening the sense of belonging.

AB  - To slow down the damage to the earth and improve the quality of the living environment, the concept of sustainable ecology has been gradually applied to architectural design and urban planning, and green buildings that emphasise ecology, environmental protection, sustainability, and symbiosis with the environment have become the most important means in developing architectural strategies in various countries. This study takes the general public in the Jiyuan City of Henan Province as the object for the questionnaire analysis. In this study, 400 research samples are distributed and 334 valid questionnaires are recovered, with a recovery rate of 84%. The more the appearance of the building environment can show the regional characteristics of the integration with the natural environment, the higher its preference value and the more positive image appear. According to the result, it is expected that the public can directly feel the image of green building, thus accepting the green building environment consistent with cognition, promoting green building more effectively, and achieving the goals of unity of knowledge and practice and sustainable development.

AB  - The spatial mismatch between jobs and housing in cities creates long daily travels that exacerbate climate change, air pollution, and traffic congestion. Yet, not enough research on occupational differences has been done. This study first applies the Hidden Markov Mixture Model (H3M) to model travel patterns for different occupation groups in Hong Kong. Then, the Variational Bayesian Hierarchical EM algorithm is used to identify common lifestyle clusters. Next, a binary logistic regression is developed to examine whether the lifestyle clusters can be explained by jobs-housing balance. This study is among the first to consider travel patterns as a Markov process and apply H3M to examine jobs-housing balance by fine-grain occupation group. The method is transferable and universally applicable; and the results provide occupation-specific insights on jobs-housing balance in an Asian context. The research findings suggest that different occupation groups have different travel patterns in Hong Kong. Two lifestyle clusters, "balanced and compact activity space" and "work-oriented and extensive travels", are unveiled. Notably, the latter is associated a lower level of jobs-housing balance. Some occupations in the quaternary industry ("information and communications", "profession, science and technology", "real estate", and "finance and insurance") are having more serious jobs-housing imbalance. The paper concludes with a discussion on improving the occupation-specific jobs-housing balance in accordance with Hong Kong's future development goals.

AB  - By the late 1960s, Japan's postwar housing boom had resulted in supply exceeding demand. But these buildings were poor quality and short-lived. Since then, the country has seen various initiatives - both public and private - to improve the building stock and make it sustainable. Ranging from construction guidelines, to tax incentives, to technical innovations, they have achieved considerable success. Kazunobu Minami - Professor of Architecture at the Shibaura Institute of Technology in Tokyo, who has worked as an architect for the Japanese government since 1981 - tells their story.

AB  - Based on a comparative analysis of real estate price structures in a hundred major French urban areas, this article challenges the idea of the predominance of the "classic" centre periphery model, according to which prices decrease with distance from the centre. While this "classic" model underpins much work in the field of urban studies, two other models can be identified. A detailed comparison of urban development of Lyon and Marseille-Aix, two areas that have followed opposing models, helps lay the groundwork for a sociogenetic study of social divisions of space and thus to explaining the observed emergence of two price structures. Using these two case studies as a starting point, the article shows how the value of places is constructed through a cumulative process based on the interaction between long-term population dynamics, socioeconomic change and urban policies. It also highlights how general processes, such as metropolitanization, produce different effects on urban structures which themselves differ. Finally, the article stresses the need to place the real estate market at the centre of the analysis of forms of sociospatial structuring of the city.

AB  - Objective Description of the three-year course of mental illness after supplying permanent housing to homeless individuals. Methods 109-male and 20 female homeless individuals were assessed at the assignment of permanent housing and at one and three year follow-up using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Results A high percentage (86%) was able to maintain or even improve the index housing situation. Only minor changes were observed in mental illness severity and global functioning. Symptoms improved slightly over the three year period. High degrees of alcohol consumption and mental illness severity increased the risk of deterioration of the housing arrangement. Conclusions Supplying homeless individuals with permanent housing is an effective measure but insufficient for improving mental illness. Combined measures of social and medical interventions from one provider are suggested for effective support of homeless people.

AB  - As debates about housing form an increasingly important arena of political controversy, much has been written about the new fissures that have appeared as governments not only struggle to reduce public expenditure deficits but also attempt to address problems such as affordability and homelessness. It is widely anticipated that new conflicts will be played out in the private rental market as access to homeownership becomes unrealistic and the supply of social housing diminishes. However, what other tensions might surface; that hitherto have not been subject to the critical gaze of housing research? In this paper, we provide some thoughts on the nascent policy issues as well as the ideological schisms that are likely to develop in coming years, offering suggestions as to how the focus of housing policy research might be reoriented towards a "politics" framework to capture and better understand the conflicts that are likely to arise.

AB  - This article seeks to contribute to geography's continued interest in architecture through a focus on the 'intimate architectural space' of the door. Its aims are threefold; the first section seeks to extend knowledge of the door within geographic literature as it becomes a key site in which 'events are gathered' and through which politics can be encountered; the second section takes a 'minor theory approach', using a range of non-western, feminist, and class-based perspectives, exploring the social and political affordances of the door through the themes of 'body' and 'performativity'. Whilst the conclusion uses these discussions to demonstrate how intimate architectures might further develop our knowledge of built spaces, providing an additional framework to engage with the often-overlooked aspects of architecture. In doing so, the door is presented as a site that structures how we move and relate to our bodies in physical space; most notably that the door's capacity as a barrier maintains a distinct exclusionary politics which reinforces class and racial divisions through the built environment.

AB  - Fondazione Cassa Di Risparmio Di Trento E Rovereto This contribution presents the results of an ethnographic research, conducted in the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy), which investigated the living conditions of refugees and asylum seekers outside the reception system and explored the heterogeneous and fragmented world of pathways they undertake in search of work and accommodation. From the point of view of housing, the investigation has shown how individuals put in place different kind of tactics and strategies. Generally, among these, informal settlements seemed to be the most common solution. However, what we focus on relates to both the effects produced on migrants' everyday life by the environments and the material conditions of these settlements and the forms of re-appropriation of the spaces exercised by the individuals. For instance, this is the case of 'Le Albere': a residential and commercial area designed by a famous architect which has become the 'home' of many refugees excluded by the reception system. How does this place affect migrants' everyday lives? Why do they prefer to live in this area? How does their presence re-shape such space? These are the main questions that this contribution aims to answer.

Our findings suggest that the monetary policy transmission mechanism to the housing market has not changed with the implementation of quantitative easing or forward guidance for most economies considered. A counterfactual exercise provides some evidence that UMP has been particularly successful in dampening the consequences of the financial crisis on housing markets in the USA, while the effects are more muted in the remaining countries considered.

AB  - For conservation of heritages or life prolongation of aged buildings that contributes to environmental sustainability, there is a global need of structural strengthening or upgrading so as to restore their original functions or fulfil more stringent performance requirements stipulated in modern design codes of practice. However, the actual implementation is usually met with resistance from the property owner; hence, it is desirable to adopt an effective, economical and less invasive technique. In order to provide a further incentive, this article explores an innovative idea of upscaling decorative architectural elements, such as brackets, knee braces and corbels, in order that they also possess adequate strength capacity to resist extreme loadings such as earthquake actions. The required dimensions of architectural brackets for seismic retrofitting of concrete beam-column joints are calculated for different levels of seismicity through a parametric study. It is demonstrated that the proposed design can enhance both the aesthetics and structural performance of a building. This exemplifies how art can be integrated into engineering design for solving real-world problems.

AB  - To synchronize designers early in the design process and help them understand the building forms and performance metrics needed to meet both qualitative and quantitative requirements is crucial for sustainable building designs. While the prevalent design exploration technique, which integrates self-organizing mapping with a Supervised Learning-based Agent Model (SOMMLPNN), offers insights into design geometry and solar potential, it still has limitations in the range of the design exploration space, the efficiency and accuracy of data approximation, and the uncertainty in dealing with performance metrics related to more complex environmental factors. Using the solar potential of tower buildings as an example, this study proposes a method based on SOM-MLPNN by integrating a Generalized Tower Generator (GTG) and form description, testing its usability for the inclusion of complex surrounding environments, and improving its design exploration breadth as well as the efficiency and accuracy of data approximations. The results demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy in data approximation across an expansive design space, facilitating visual and interactive exploration of design-performance relationships. The proposed method emphasizes the critical interplay between building geometry and environmentrelated performance, providing designers with a refined toolkit for discerning the correlation between design and performance, thereby enhancing their design decision-making abilities.

AB  - The likely installation of, and potential energy savings from, low carbon technologies in domestic buildings is not only dependent on those who fit them, but also the broader supply chains of which they are part. Despite this, the role of supply chain actors has been largely overlooked in strategies seeking to encourage the installation of more sustainable domestic heating technologies. With reference to central heating, this paper responds through an ethnographic analysis of how plumbers' merchants and sales representatives can influence the work of heating installers in the United Kingdom. It applies two dimensions of the concept of 'social capital': relational and structural. Relational social capital focuses on the trust, loyalty and reciprocity at play in relations, whilst structural social capital considers how the strength of tie can influence those to whom people turn for advice and support. Together, these ideas demonstrate how relationships amongst these groups can serve to influence product choice and facilitate information exchange. The paper concludes by discussing how these supply chains might be engaged with as a means of encouraging the installation of low carbon domestic technologies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - A generally accepted way of building passive houses has been to have small windows facing north and large windows to the south. This is to minimize losses on the north side while gaining as much solar heat as possible on the south. ln spring 2001, 20 terraced houses were built outside Gothenburg partly in this way. The indoor temperature is kept at a comfortable level by passive methods, using solar gains and internal gains from household appliances and occupants. Heat losses are very low, since the building envelope is well insulated and since modem coated triple-glazed windows have been installed. The purpose of this work was to investigate how decreasing the window size facing south and increasing the window size facing north in these low energy houses would influence the energy consumption and maximum power needed to keep the indoor temperature between 23 and 26 degrees C. Different orientations have been investigated as well as the influence of window type. A dynamic building simulation tool, DEROB-LTH, was used and the simulations indicate an extremely low energy demand for the houses. The results show that the size of the energy efficient windows does not have a major influence on the heating demand in the winter, but is relevant for the cooling need in the summer. This indicates that instead of the traditional way of building passive houses it is possible to enlarge the window area facing north and get better lighting conditions. To decrease the risk of excessive temperatures or energy needed for cooling, there is an optimal window size facing south that is smaller than the original size of the investigated buildings.

AB  - This research aims to identify the statistical sensitivity of multi-scale urban design factors regarding buildings' energy demand located in three districts in the city of Toulouse, France. The research method is composed of four main steps: (a) three typical urban blocks of Toulouse are parametrized, considering factors ranging from the urban form to the building material scales: (b) a fractional factorial sampling method is applied which allows elaborating statistically representative and non-redundant scenarios from all design variables and for each specific urban district; (c) the urban energy models generated are interactively assessed regarding the annual buildings' heating and cooling loads for the temperate climate context of Toulouse, France; (d) through a global sensitivity analysis, results obtained are estimated through a statistic hypothesis test, which allows identifying the influence of the design variables on each energy response of interest. Results show that urban multi-scale design variables may have divergent influence on the same energy response when the urban form context changes. For traditional urban compact blocks, two less current urban form factors considered in this study (the courtyard aspect ratio and the standard-deviation of the built height) account for almost 50% of the overall impact on heating demand of buildings while building and envelope scale factors, such as glazing window properties, have more influence for pavilions and slabs urban blocks. The relevance of certain factors was strongly linked to their typologies or to their urban environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Disordered urban environments negatively impact mental health symptoms and disorders. While many aspects of the built environment have been studied, one influence may come from inequitable, discriminatory housing practices such as redlin-ing, blockbusting, and gentrification. The patterns of disinvestment and reinvestment that follow may be an underlying mechanism predicting poor mental health. In this study, we examine pathways between such practices and internalizing symptoms (i.e., anxiety and depression) among a sample of African American youth in Baltimore, Maryland, considering moderation and mediation pathways including neighborhood social cohesion and sex. In our direct models, the inequitable housing practices were not significant predictors of social cohesion. In our sex moderation model, however, we find nega-tive influences on social cohesion: for girls from gentrification, and for boys from blockbusting. Our moderated mediation model shows that girls in gentrifying neighborhoods who experience lower social cohesion have higher levels of internal-izing symptoms. Likewise for boys, living in a formerly blockbusted neighborhood generates poorer social cohesion, which in turn drives higher rates of internalizing symptoms. A key implication of this work is that, in addition to standard mea-sures of the contemporary built environment, considering other invisible patterns related to discriminatory and inequitable housing practices is important in understanding the types of neighborhoods where anxiety and depression are more preva-lent. And while some recent work has discussed the importance of considering phenomena like redlining in considering long-term trajectories of neighborhoods, other patterns such as blockbusting and gentrification may be equally important.

AB  - The building sector is material-intensive and is responsible for consuming large quantities of local and international resources. In extreme climates, the consumption of these resources increases manifold to ensure comfortable indoors. Contemporary buildings have predominantly used energy efficiency as the main criterion to define sustainability, which has led to the consumption of more abiotic materials. In contrast, indigenous buildings are based on local context and are guided by geographical, environmental, and economic constraints. This work aims to critically review indigenous architectural practices across four climatic zones, focusing on their resource efficiency, and identify practices that can be reintroduced in contemporary construction in extremely cold climates. To achieve this objective, literature from 1960 to 2022 was comprehensively reviewed. In addition, contemporary building construction and codes in cold climatic regions were analyzed to assess the current state of practices. Specific case studies from each climatic region were evaluated to assess applicability in residential buildings in cold climates. The main findings from this review and analysis indicate that indigenous practices have the potential to optimize the use of natural resources to create more sustainable climate-resilient buildings. In addition, more empirical studies are needed to tailor these practices and quantitatively assess resource efficiency for large-scale implementation.

AB  - This paper focuses on the measurement of local housing affordability problems. A number of different housing market indicators are offered that help identify the magnitude and nature of housing affordability problems and their geographic distribution. This interest is prompted by the predominance of housing affordability problems and the severity of the problems for many of the lowest income renter households. In addition, there is significant policy interest in ''the national goal that every American family be able to afford a decent home in a suitable environment'' (National Affordable Housing Act of 1990). This paper develops measures of the spatial distribution of affordability problems and implements measures of the mismatch between the demand and supply of housing affordable to the lowest income households.

AB  - Between 1980 and 2016 the share of households in the bottom quintile of the income distribution that owned their own home declined by 10 percentage points. For the same households, the share of monthly income spent on rent increased from 28% in 1960 to over 42% in 2016. To asses the extent to which income stagnation is responsible for the decline in affordability, I use Census microdata to construct counterfactual simulations that capture the evolution of housing market trends under alternative assumptions about the distribution of income. Income stagnation explains nearly the entire decline in affordability for the bottom quintile. Housing market frictions that cause the price of housing to deviate from marginal cost matter more to households further up the income distribution. Using Atkinson-type welfare-based inequality measures, I find that the counterfactual distribution of income - with inequality held constant - results in greater welfare for nearly all possible levels of inequality aversion.

AB  - Since 1998, the Chinese housing market has played a fundamental role in driving macroeconomic stability and economic growth. This paper attempts to estimate the income elasticity of housing demand in Shanghai based on a household survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2007. We utilize a two-stage model, which integrates analysis of both tenure choice and housing demand. Our findings indicate that both permanent and current income has significant influence on tenure choice in Shanghai, and that owner-occupiers' permanent income elasticity of housing demand in Shanghai is between 0.375 and 0.447. Our research also suggests that migrant homeowners have higher permanent income elasticity than Shanghai natives and that most Chinese households are liquidity constrained with regards to obtaining homeownership. We also find that permanent income elasticity increases with age. Finally, the existence of an urban-rural and regional difference is shown.

AB  - Reducing household energy use in social housing buildings can substantially contribute to mitigating global climate change. While municipalities and social housing corporations are willing to invest in sustainable renovations and innovations, social housing residents' inclusion in the sustainable energy transition lags behind. This pilot study explored social housing residents' attitudes toward sustainability and sustainable renovation of their apartment building, as well as (factors underlying) their motivation toward two specific sustainable behaviors. Semi-structured interviews, containing both open- and close- ended questions, were conducted with 20 residents of one social housing building that was due for renovations. Results showed that respondents were concerned about climate change, including environmental justice beliefs, typically already engaged in various sustainable behaviors, and were motivated to add sustainable behaviors to their repertoire after the renovation. Yet, perceived social norms were not always supportive of behaving sustainably and respondents sometimes failed to recognize the sustainable value of these behaviors. Furthermore, while respondents were more positive than negative about the sustainable renovation, they nevertheless listed many concerns and problems regarding the renovation process, including procedural justice concerns. This small-scale study provided important insights into barriers and facilitators of the sustainable energy transition among social housing residents, who are at risk of lagging behind in the sustainable urban energy transition. Findings underline the importance of including residents in the sustainable renovation process through engagement, communication, and co-creation.

AB  - For many years, the housing environment has been acknowledged as one of the main settings that affect human health. Living and housing conditions are the basis of many factors influencing residential health. Still, to date there is no commonly agreed upon definition of 'healthy housing', and there are still major gaps in the knowledge on how housing conditions may affect health. Epidemiological findings suggest strong associations between housing conditions and health effects. This paper explores the relevance of housing conditions as a key factor influencing mental health, sleep quality, indoor air, home safety, accessibility, obesity, mould growth, hygrothermal conditions and energy consumption, perception of crime, and residential quality.

AB  - With an over 20 -fold increase in population between 1963 and today, Lagos has expanded significantly both within and outside its city administrative boundaries. Some paradoxes are identified using mixed methodologies from a qualitative research design. Lagos's northwards expansion has exerted several externalities on a neighbouring state. Expansion within Lagos, on its coastal south-eastern axis, is defined by real estate activities of a different nature. In both cases, new settlements have emerged with differing social and economic characteristics that have far-reaching impact for housing accessibility and affordability. These differences are explored by establishing pull -factors responsible for attracting specific income groups to each axis, the impact of government action (and inaction), and the implications of these for city growth and management. Formal mechanisms of planning lead to a proliferation of higher end real estate development. This has created unequal access to land and housing for lower income families. The subsequent exclusion of lower income families from planned areas represents a failure of the market system. Lagos presents compelling complexities of the management of urban expansion that spread beyond administrative boundaries, as well as the influence of planning to achieve economic development.

AB  - Concrete is a heavyweight construction material whose high thermal mass could increase the thermal storage capacity of a building envelope and in turn affect indoor thermal comfort. Selecting an appropriate method for concrete construction and form could also affect the total energy performance and thermal comfort of a building, a fact that is often overlooked by structural engineers. This study presents the results of energy simulations of the potential impact that concrete construction forms, in particular two slab types, and structural materials have on the energy consumption of archetypal commercial office buildings in five major Australia cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and Darwin). This study has three stages: 1) a structural analysis of two slab types (Flat and Waffle slab); 2) the selection of two types of structural concrete (conventional Normal weight concrete and novel Ultra-lightweight concrete); 3) a comparative analysis to quantify the magnitude of the change in predicted annual energy consumption due to changes in the form of construction and the type of structural concrete. The energy simulation results showed that the thermal energy performance of the building was influenced by structural materials and slab types. It is shown that the thermal capacity of the concrete construction forms can be utilized to shift thermal loads, reduce peak demand and reduce operational energy consumption. The selection of an appropriate concrete type was more important in terms of energy performance in the coldest (Melbourne and Canberra) and hottest (Darwin) climate zones of this study.

AB  - There is a growing interest in the literature to understand how actions taken by occupants and facility managers can affect building performance. However, user-centric building energy research: (1) remains understudied compared to design-focused research efforts; (2) overlooks combined effects or uncertainty in multiple parameters; and (3) typically does not cover particular types of buildings (e.g., educational facilities), nor buildings subject to extreme weather conditions. This paper fills an important gap in the literature by proposing a comprehensive energy modeling and analysis framework to quantify the impact of human action on building energy consumption. The framework applies various data analysis methods such as differential, fractional factorial, and Monte Carlo analysis methods, in order to capture potential combined or synergetic effects of human actions on building performance. A case study is then presented on typical educational buildings located in the extreme hot climate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Results indicate that uncertainty in human actions can lead up to a +/- 25% variation from average energy consumption levels, confirming the significant role that people have in making their built environment more efficient and sustainable.

AB  - Although government-led housing affordability policy is an important issue worldwide, there has been little research on how local governments' commitment to such policy affects people's subjective well-being or happiness. By combining the analysis of textual information from provincial governments' annual working reports and microdata from four waves of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), this article empirically explores the relationship between political discourses of provincial governments' committment to housing affordability policies (HAPC) and residents' self-reported happiness. Our results suggest that Chinese urban residents' happiness is higher when the local government promises greater dedication to housing affordability improvement; however, this phenomenon existed only in the early 2010s, and the relationship between HAPC and residents' happiness was insignificant in the mid-2010s, and even became negative in the late 2010s. In addition, we also find that the the association between HAPC and residents' happiness differs among population groups. We conclude the article with discussions of the implications of the findings for housing policymaking and urban governance.

AB  - The per capita consumption of electricity in Abu Dhabi is one of the highest in the world. Air cooling (AC) in the residential sector is responsible for much of this consumption. A preliminary energy survey of 36 residential units (18 villas and 18 flats) was carried out in Abu Dhabi, followed by a more detailed energy audit of 15 villas owned and occupied by Emirati citizens. The mean per capita use of electricity in villas was 16,874 +/- 4421 kWh/ca/yr and the mean energy intensity was 349.1 +/- 102.6 kWh/m(2). AC and domestic water heating (DWH) systems operate 24 h/day in most rooms of 12 villas, including times of no occupancy, and at least 9-14 h/day in most rooms of the other three dwellings. Building characteristics of the villas audited do not meet minimum Estidama Pearl 1 requirements, and their orientation often maximizes exposure to solar radiation. Model simulations provided estimates of the large energy savings achievable by increasing the AC thermostat temperature to 24 degrees C, by switching off AC and DWH when these are not needed and by retrofitting villas with roof insulation. These results highlight the importance of occupants' behaviour for energy conservation in the residential sector of Abu Dhabi. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As there are different possible future scenarios of immigration that will impact urban transformation in Switzerland, we have developed an agent-based dwellings model that, with reasonable computing time due to the use of the computer architecture of graphical processor units, can simulate for a time horizon of decades, the annual evolution of millions of individually characterised households. This dwellings model is coupled to an agent-based population model that simulates millions of individual population agents. We simulate different immigration scenarios, up to 2035, in the Swiss agglomeration of Lausanne. It is shown that the building capacity of the city of Lausanne will reach a limit in 2022, subsequently leading to more rapid growth in the periphery of the agglomeration Lausanne. The construction of new residential dwellings consists primarily of smaller apartments that are more attractive to the demographic of smaller households; this demographic tends to move to the periphery. As families tend to move towards the city centre due to the availability of services, the city and periphery show opposite evolutions over time in the numbers of family households compared to numbers of singles and couples households. The periphery requires an increase in the number and typology of services targeted at the growing demographic of smaller households. Further as most workplaces are still be located in the city centre, the planned improvement of transportation infrastructure in the agglomeration should primarily focus on improved access to the periphery. These observations underline the profound impact of the typology of immigration on the demand for suitable housing, and thus on urban development.

AB  - This article considers visual design as a complementary form of strategic planning that relies on images to sway the approval of future housing developments. The study of promotional materials in the city of London provides an opportunity to reflect on the relationship between represented and constructed space and on the rhetoric employed by the neoliberal real estate market. For this reason, the research is based on a transdisciplinary approach that merges hermeneutics and urban sciences. The results showed a strong correspondence between the alteration of the represented reality and the perception of the built environment. This trend is connected to a more general tendency towards the financialisation of architecture, which focuses on space simplification and the primacy of feelings. This exacerbates both visual and spatial inclusion processes, allowing us to address issues of access to housing, justice, and equity as a lens to observe and unpack a global trend with precise spatial outcomes.

AB  - Interactions between human beings and the built environment are mediated by physiological and psychological stimuli. which may interfere in the perception and satisfaction related to indoor comfort variables. The study aims to explore the relationship between daylighting features and possible impacts on humans in regards to lighting preferences. The influence of different daylighting configurations, glazed facade orientation and season of the year on lighting preferences in human beings was evaluated by means of tests in a rotating climate with monitoring of environmental variables, developed by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany. The sample, n = 16, is composed of German male students (height SD = 1.80 m, SD = 0.06; body weight SD = 80 kg, SD = 8.9; and age SD = 24.9 years, SD = 3.6). Under controlled thermal conditions (PMV approx. +/- 0.5), participants remained in two office-like environments over 5 h (8:00 am to 1:00 pm - local time) three days in a row, for three seasons of the year, totaling nine days of data collection per participant. Definitions of glazed facade orientations for the experimental rounds were done by means of computer simulations. Objective variables were measured by spectroradiometers at desk height, with sensor h ca. 0.90 in, and comfortmeters. Preferences of daylighting features was assessed by a questionnaire with Likert-scale alternatives, administered online at 8:50 am, 10:30 am and 12:30 pm. Objective and subjective data were analyzed statistically (Spearman's rho, rs), suggesting possible correlations between lighting preferences and objective variables. including: E (Ix), CCT (K), DWI (nm) and the circadian metric a(cv) (circaclian action factor).

AB  - Share housing is changing. Once considered a form of short-term housing and a lifestyle choice for young adults fresh out of the family home, share housing is increasingly playing a broader role into advanced adulthood. Recent work has claimed the emergence of Generation Rent; however, the reconfiguration of housing experiences is illustrated not only by renting but also by an increase in house sharing and the emergence of Generation Share' within the renting cohort. We know surprisingly little about share housing and its increasingly important role in housing. This paper draws upon exploratory research conducted on share housing in Sydney, Australia, and argues that share housing as traditionally understood is changing. Share housing has a widening demographic and it is driven primarily by economic factors. Despite this, the social affordances offered by share housing are highly valued. Share housing therefore offers us a unique lens into changing housing pathways and values and provokes us to think of ways to produce more socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable housing.

AB  - Older people seeking affordable housing in the mainstream housing tenures such as home ownership, private renting and social housing face increasing difficulties in accessing and remaining in appropriate housing. The mainstream housing tenures face pressure due to widening housing affordability problems in home ownership and the private rental sector in many advanced economies, exacerbated by declining investment in social housing. Hybrid housing models are often promoted as affordable and sometimes appropriate and adequate housing options for older people. These models combine aspects of ownership and renting in diverse ways, often posing challenges for tenure-based housing policies. Drawing on the case of Australia, the paper presents the findings of an institutional review of the production, consumption, management, and exchange of land lease communities, often marketed as a more affordable form of housing for older people compared to the more established hybrid form of retirement villages. Noting difficulties in scoping the size and significance of the land lease community sector from current data collections, we find (a) entry of large institutional investors risks undermining the relative affordability of the sector for older people; (b) security of occupancy is a critical policy issue and (c) concentration in rural areas raises concerns around risk of natural disasters and access to aged care and other services. These issues are often overlooked in housing policy and pose challenges for other policy domains including income support, social care, and health services.

AB  - Accurate assessments of construction materials stocked in the built environment have received increased attention in the Industrial Ecology literature over the past few years. Many recent models that estimate building material inflows, stock accumulation and end-of-life waste, however, rely on simplistic assumptions about the lifespan of built infrastructure. While several probability distributions have been proposed (normal, Weibull, log-normal, and so on) there is no agreement on which model is best suited for modelling the accumulation of building material stock at urban and national levels. In this study we introduce an analysis of the hazard rate of buildings and discuss alternative distribution functions to model lifespan, testing the fit of five commonly used distributions to real data from the cities of Nagoya (Japan), Wakayama (Japan), and Salford (UK). The results highlight how cities with fast replacement rates are overall best modelled by right-skewed distributions, but single cohort levels express independent behaviours based on their characteristics. We investigate the sensitivity of a top-down stock accumulation model to the choice of different distributions and input parameters uncertainties. The results show that different lifespan distribution functions result in very similar overall stock accumulation at the national level, but have large impacts on calculated demolition waste flows. Differences are more pronounced for cities and the choice of a certain distribution will significantly affect the calculation of the average lifetime. Our results suggest that top-down national material stock accounts have high reliability, and are only weakly affected by the choice of one distribution over another. For cities, it is beneficial to use a distribution based on the characteristics of the buildings analysed, with regard to density and building characteristics. Stock accumulation research would profit from future bottom-up research into building lifespans to validate top-down estimation procedures. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Housing is an important expression of prosperity for a society and a determinant of health and well-being. Despite the fact that the housing industry, which has faced rapid transformation and growth in Turkey since the 2000s, has made many people homeowners, being a homeowner alone does not ensure the subjective well-being of individuals. The conditions of individuals' houses are also significant for their well-being. Accordingly, the Survey on Income and Living Conditions covering the years 2014-2017 was used to determine whether inequalities in housing conditions are linked to health problems among households. An index that measures the housing conditions of 5,549 households was devised and its effects on self-rated health, along with other socioeconomic indicators, were examined using a random-effects ordered logistic model. The findings indicate that the quality of housing enhances self-rated health in Turkey. More specifically, improved housing conditions tend to increase the likelihood of individuals being healthier. As the results show that inequality in housing conditions has a significant effect on general health, alongside education, gender, and marital status, housing policies should not only focus on the affordability of housing but should also take social welfare indicators into account.

AB  - This research investigates sustainable building design from a new perspective - green design in relation to green building rating systems. We examine the potential influence of Green Star (GS) in Australia on the design of a project and compare this with the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) in America and Assessment Standard for Green Buildings (ASGB) in China. The comparison is conducted using a typical case study of a GS Six Stars certified example, the Melbourne School of Design building. A critical review concludes that LEED and ASGB are design-guide schemes while GS is a performance-based rating system and this affects the project outcome. We note that LEED is oriented to energy efficiency while GS and ASGB holistically consider energy and indoor environment quality. GS, additionally, emphasizes project process management. Potential LEED and ASGB certification levels for the case are calculated; possible changes to the design are indicated to achieve the highest LEED and ASGB levels. The predicted results demonstrate the influence of different environmental concerns and assessment approaches of the three on the green design and the performance of buildings themselves. Based on this finding, the paper argues that a performance-based rating system (e.g. GS) is more beneficial to the practice of designing green, compared with other measure-based systems.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to determine to what extent the housing affordability crisis is a "global" crisis and to what extent there is a variation across countries and over time, in who is concerned about housing affordability. Design/methodology/approach The author analyses data from about 500,000 respondents from over 140 countries and uses both descriptive statistics as well as regression analysis (using a random effects within between model [Bellet al., 2019]). Findings The findings show that concerns about housing affordability are widespread both within and across countries but the extent of these concerns depends greatly on the country, the subgroup and the indicator analysed. Moreover, in many countries, more people worry about other aspects of life than about housing affordability. Research limitations/implications The global diversity in the housing affordability crisis suggests that one should be cautious when extrapolating research findings for a given country to other countries or when proposing housing policy transfer across countries. Practical implications The specific nature of the housing affordability crisis varies substantially across countries. Policymakers thus should be aware that there is no guarantee that a housing affordability policy that was effective in one country will also be effective in another country. Originality/value This paper is original in its use of the Gallup World poll, a unique survey, which is done world-wide and hence is ideally suited for the purpose of this paper, providing a much more detailed picture of the global housing crisis than so far available in the literature.

AB  - This study investigates the role of sense of place (SoP) in the relationship between the neighbourhood environment (NE) and subjective well-being (SWB), focusing on Chinese migrants who face spatial and cultural displacement. Beyond previous research, we further consider the influence of residential length. Surveying 716 migrants in Wuhan in 2018, we explore the dynamic place mechanisms underlying the association between the NE and SWB. Our findings reveal that the physical and social aspects of the NE, particularly walkability and social integration, significantly impact migrants' SWB. Moreover, SoP mediates the relationship between the NE and SWB, highlighting the social production function of people and places in communities. Long-term residence does not directly affect migrants' SWB, yet just indirectly influence SWB through SoP. This underscores the ongoing pertinence and significance of SoP, connecting residential stability to positive social implications. This study concludes that the place mechanism underlying the association between the NE and migrants' SWB operates both through migrants' emotional connections to a specific place (SoP) and the reinforcement of place experience resulting from a longer duration of residence. To establish inclusive communities, we propose planning and governance measures that enhance space quality, empower neighbourhoods to foster SoP, strengthen residential stability, and improve migrants' SWB.

AB  - Spatial planning aims to improve the socioeconomic and environmental sustainability of a region, yet, in the spatial planning framework, it is difficult to capture the environmental impacts of the lifestyle of residents as a whole. We use carbon load as an indicator for environmental pressure and explore the spatial variations in carbon load from transport, domestic energy use, and the consumption of goods based on data obtained from the Household Budget Survey in Estonia, in an attempt to understand how residential location is related to the environmental load of household consumption. We use environmentally extended input-output computing for carbon accounting, multiple regression models for statistical analysis, and settlement hierarchy as an analytic tool for characterizing residential location. The results show that the capital region and other higher-level settlements provide favorable conditions for the consumption of leisure-related goods and services even when other socioeconomic variables are taken into account. Industrial cities dominated by apartment block housing are characterized by conservative consumption patterns of residents. For rural residents, a lower carbon load imposed from other consumption categories compensates for their higher dependency on cars. We conclude that there is a need for an integrated and balanced spatial planning policy that considers the entire consumption pattern of populations in different settlement types.

AB  - Window view is an important parameter of comfortable living. In densely urbanized areas, window view is often limited to a nearby facade, without all three visual layers visible and possibility of distant view. The purpose of the study is to examine what reactions are triggered by views of nearby facades, which by definition are not quality window views, and how observers' reactions are influenced by additional greenery on the facade. A questionnaire survey was used in the study as a method for obtaining research data. Respondents defined reactions to 20 various window views and the reasons for them. The results showed that reactions to window views of nearby facades varied, and that the negative response depended not only on a limited number of visual layers and the distance between buildings, but also on the visual aesthetic. Furthermore, added greenery in the window view triggered more positive reactions than did facades without greenery. Measures for greening facades are proposed.

AB  - This study, which is based on the social capital theory, explores how the political skills of salespersons (which include interpersonal influence (II), social astuteness (SA), networking ability (NA), and apparent sincerity (AS)) affect the trust of their clients in order to increase their loyalty. By incorporating the concept of political skills into research on real estate sales behavior, this study addresses the literature gap on the lack of discussion of the social abilities of salespersons in the real estate industry. To validate this theoretical model, this study targets real estate salespersons and buyers in Taiwan, by using questionnaires to collect dyadic data, and linear regression modeling to test the relevant hypotheses. The results indicate that among the political skills, II and SA are positively significant, thus indicating that salespersons with high degrees of II and SA are capable of increasing the trust of their clients, which in turn increases client loyalty. Moreover, the interaction effects on client trust are all negative and significant, which suggest that self -efficacy has a crucial moderating role. Salespersons with low self -efficacy who have NA and AS can enhance client trust. The findings of this study can be considered as constructive advice for the real estate industry in their training of salespersons.

AB  - Housing is a major component of wealth. Since house prices fluctuate considerably over time, it is important to understand how these fluctuations affect households' consumption decisions. Rising house prices may stimulate consumption by increasing households' perceived wealth, or by relaxing borrowing constraints. This paper investigates the response of household consumption to house prices using UK micro data. We estimate the largest effect of house prices on consumption for older homeowners, and the smallest effect, insignificantly different from zero, for younger renters. This finding is consistent with heterogeneity in the wealth effect across these groups. In addition, we find that regional house prices affect regional consumption growth. Predictable changes in house prices are correlated with predictable changes in consumption, particularly for households that are more likely to be borrowing constrained, but this effect is driven by national rather than regional house prices and is important for renters as well as homeowners, suggesting that UK house prices are correlated with aggregate financial market conditions.

AB  - After the Great Recession, a historically high level of foreclosures resulted in an accumulation of vacant properties in the USA. However, much of our recent knowledge about vacant housing has focused only on shrinking cities. Using multivariate analyses with vacancy data derived from the US Postal Service, this study examines patterns and factors associated with changes in neighborhood-level, long-term vacancies in three types of metropolitan areas across the nation during the US housing recovery from 2011 to 2014. The findings suggest that neighborhood factors associated with changes in long-term vacant homes vary based on the growth trajectory of metropolitan statistical areas (metros): In weak-growth metros, larger increases in long-term vacancies tended to occur in depressed neighborhoods with high shares of African Americans and single-family home renters. In hard-hit metros, which were hit by a large decline in home values, increasing levels of long-term vacancies were prevalent in neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and higher shares of townhomes and condominiums. Finally, in strong-growth metros, increases in long-term vacancies tended to occur in outlying counties. When comparing one type of metropolitan area to another, researchers and policy makers must acknowledge the limitations of generalizing their findings. With a more thorough understanding of the variations in the neighborhood dynamics of the housing market, they will be more equipped to inform both housing policy and research.

AB  - A number of place-based policies attempt to deconcentrate poverty, yet not enough is known about how the socioeconomic mix of low-income neighborhoods evolves nor the role of residential mobility in this evolution. This study focuses on changes in low-income neighborhoods as they transpire at the micro level of housing unit turnover. Using a unique panel survey of low-income neighborhoods, the study examines how characteristics of previous occupants, housing units, and neighborhoods affect the chances that units will transition into or out of poverty. Results show that although turnover rates are high, the poverty status of occupants changes infrequently. Occupant, unit, and neighborhood factors help to explain the changes that do occur. Improving low-income neighborhoods is challenging because the poverty status of occupants tends not to change, but there are aspects of the built and social environment that can affect occupancy transitions in ways that reduce poverty concentration.

Data are drawn from two cities, Auckland and Christchurch. Evaluations of their housing by respondents themselves and trained interviewers revealed that these groups mere significantly disadvantaged compared to the mean for urban New Zealanders, as measured by a random sample (n = 100). Analysis using a scale of housing stressors and the General Health Questionnaire revealed the particularly marginalised positions of women and ethnic minority groups in the housing market.

AB  - Since devolution, Scotland has been perceived as an international trailblazer in homelessness policy. This is principally due to The Homelessness Etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 which led to the 'priority need' category being abolished in 2012, thus placing a statutory duty upon local authorities to provide settled accommodation to nearly all homeless households. This has been widely praised for extending citizenship rights to those experiencing homelessness. In contrast to this, this paper examines the experiences of young people (aged 16-24) where judgements on whether they were 'housing ready' delayed them being provided settled accommodation. Drawing on Bourdieu's writing on rites of institution, it is shown how the symbolic categories deployed by support services and landlords operated as a means of 'vision and division', creating new social positions that lengthened the pathway out of homelessness. In a complimentary move, there was a fusion of support with control mechanisms to determine a person's readiness for settled accommodation.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequently increased time spent at home signified the importance of understanding on the link between housing and mental health. This paper examines how housing qualities affect depression and suicide ideation for each age group (i.e. young adults, middle-aged and older adults) and gender. With South Korea population-based panel data, fixed-effect models and a partial least squares structural equation model were used. A functional problem was a major risk factor for depression in women, whereas a structural problem was a key risk factor for men's depression. For older adults, living in basement and vulnerability to natural disaster were detrimental to mental health. Functional problems increased the likelihood of suicide ideation in the middle-aged. The mechanisms of the housing qualities-mental health nexus were varied by age and gender. This paper proposed policy suggestions including a tailored housing policy and provision, a housing rating system for health and a support system for noise control.

AB  - Adequate supply of housing remains a challenge in developing countries. This article assesses the extent of housing poverty in developing countries and its implication for decent accommodation1 in Swedru, Ghana. Using a cross-sectional survey design coupled with stratified and systematic sampling techniques, 1,161 household participants were selected. Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect raw data from 496 houses in 16 neighbourhoods in the Swedru Township, Ghana. Findings showed that the vast majority of houses in the Swedru Township share common housing facilities such as bathroom and lavatory. This has compelled some households to resort to bathing in open spaces, while practising free range especially in the morning where households have to queue for bathing and using the toilet facility. A room occupancy rate of 5.51 indicates that households are congested and a population of 4,603 accommodated in 496 housing units is evident. It was revealed that the high level of non-decent accommodation in the municipality is attributable to ill-enforcement of building laws that has allowed houseowners to supply housing without lavatories with impunity. Hence, effective implementation of the L.I.1630 was recommended.

AB  - Housing policy is a growing problem in many countries. Three online experiments were conducted to test framing effects in the context of housing policies in Germany. In experiment 1 (N = 303), urban growth was either described as 'rural exodus' or 'influx' of the rural population into urban areas. Experiment 2 (N = 300) focused on framing effects in the current expropriation debate in Germany. A reacquisition policy of private housing was either framed as a measure of 'expropriation' or 'repurchase'. In experiment 3 (N = 311), a vacancy taxation was either labelled to 'punish' or 'overcome' actual problems with housing shortage. A mini meta-analysis across all three studies shows that conceptual framing affects policy support in a consistent way. The data supports our hypotheses that framing has the power to influence mental representations of policy and solutions. Moreover, moderation analyses were conducted to systematically test the influence of political ideology and perceived issue relevance on framing effects. Results indicate that participants' ideological self-placement partly affects the effectiveness of linguistic framing in some contexts. Thus, the results expand existing knowledge about the effectiveness of political framing, by making visible not only the possibilities but also the boundaries of framing strategies.

AB  - The new liberal economic policy in Vietnam has had a negative effect on housing the poor. This paper reviews that housing policy and shows how it has been influenced by national economic development policy. A case study of a non-governmental organization-assisted slum up-grading project in a poor neighborhood of Ho-Chi-Minh City is used to illustrate the arguments. Although efforts were made to involve the community in the project, the centralized nature of the governmental and Communist Party structure made this nearly impossible. Although gender equality is guaranteed by the Vietnamese Constitution, evidence from the project shows the difficulty that exists in achieving it. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A small number of severely and persistently mentally ill in-patients awaiting residential or long-stay facilities represent an obstacle to the efficient utilization of acute care beds. These facilities are costly and currently reputed to be contrary to recovery principles. In 2013, all acute psychiatric care wards in Montreal identified 194 in-patients who could be discharged to residential or long-term nursing care facilities. Program clinical professionals of regional residential facilities sent adapted standardized questionnaires to ward staff. Evaluators also collected the residential preferences of both staff and patients, and then made their own assessments. The 194 in-patients were mostly middle-aged single men. Over 80% had a psychosis diagnosis and half had judicial constraints. The staff evaluated that 71.1% could be discharged from hospital within 24 h. Of these, 55% could be referred to group resources with continuous 24 h, 7 days a week staff presence, 32% could be transferred to apartments with 7-day continuous or non-continuous staff presence, 12% could be transferred to institutional care and only 2% could be moved to an apartment of their own. Evaluator and ward staff residential preferences were highly similar, but differed with patient preferences, half of whom prefer their own apartment. Discrepancy between staff evaluations and patient preferences were higher for longer stay patients with more severe symptoms and comorbidity of personality disorders.

AB  - This paper presents national data and two case studies investigating the links between housing market failure and the context of Australia's recent resource mining boom. It demonstrates how unprecedented international demand for mineral resources resulted in critical, local housing issues in mining communities. We conclude that without careful strategic planning and understanding of the economic and social role of housing, international market dynamics can create local housing situations that are vulnerable to market and social failures. While this paper highlights the challenges inherent in managing housing issues in Australia during a mining boom, there are likely to be lessons which can be applied in international settings. These challenges include the diversity in scale, cyclical and often unpredictable nature of booms; differences in housing policy and institutional arrangements across jurisdictions and the importance of leadership in growth management and planning.

AB  - Real house prices in the United States have risen by 55 percent over the last four decades, driving substantial wealth benefits to homeowners. However, research has not explored how this rise in house prices has affected White-Black wealth gaps, or the mechanisms that may underlie this relationship. Using geocoded longitudinal household-level wealth data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and tract-level house price index data, I estimate that housing market appreciation between 1984 and 2021 explains 70 percent of the increase in the median White-Black wealth gap over this period. I find that most of this effect is due to White-Black gaps in homeownership, with White-Black gaps in house values playing a smaller role. In contrast to recent findings about racialized housing markets, I do not find that gaps in neighborhood house price appreciation between White and Black homeowners contributed to White-Black wealth gaps in the 2000s and 2010s. These results highlight the importance of cumulative advantage processes in driving wealth inequalities and demonstrate how the legacies of institutional racism contribute to contemporary racial wealth gaps.

AB  - Scotland currently has 76.7% of all implemented timber-framed buildings in the UK housing market. England's figure is 16%. The English contribution is considered relatively low given its demand for more sustainable, low-cost social housing. The aim of this study is to investigate potential contemporary barriers to the adoption of timber as a primary structural material in residential housing developments in England. The research methodology is quantitative and findings revealed that a combination of economic, cultural and psychological issues rather than technical and durability performance are responsible. These are fundamentally due to lack of education regarding the use of timber, erroneously perceived increased maintenance costs of timber housing, developers' influence and monopoly over timber technology, uncertainty in property resale value and the recent overall lack of confidence in timber technology. It is recommended that improved training comprising compulsory basic timber technology and sustainable construction is adopted as a formal prerequisite for the attainment of relevant qualifications within the built environment, civil engineering and architecture. To this end, the benefits of sustainable construction, specifically, timber, in housing should be introduced even at the pre-university level, within schools and colleges. Also recommended are public awareness campaigns through relevant institutions, in the public and private sectors and among construction professionals, of the merits and misconceptions surrounding timber technology.

AB  - This study presents a comparative analysis of the housing indicators used by the single-family housing rating systems (SHRSs), in which the residential urban environment (RUE) influences buildings' certification scores, emphasizing the relationships of six systems developed by middle-income countries (MICs)-BEST, CASA, GBI, BERDE, Green Homes, and LOTUS-and the two most-recognized rating systems, BREEAM and LEED. The aim is to provide new housing indicators that are capable of bringing the concept of sustainability into the cities of MICs. The results reveal that the percentage of influence that single-family housing (SFH) can achieve in the metric established by each system is relatively low. However, considering all of the identified indicators, this influence could increase to 53.16% of the total score in multi-criteria evaluations. Furthermore, a significant lack of indicators for mandatory criteria evaluations was found, with CASA being the only system that considers their inclusion. This paper identifies 37 indicators for multi-criteria assessments and two for mandatory-criteria assessments, providing new perspectives on several topics. Furthermore, the methodology established to obtain the indicators could be useful for other researchers in the identification of new sustainable indicators.

AB  - The Sultanate of Oman is providing houses with basic services to the low-income people through the social housing program, contributing in improving their situation. However, this was not monitored, nor any users' feedback was received. The schemes ignored the people's capabilities and ingenuities to became expensive and unsuitable to the socio-cultural and economic needs of the target groups. Also these could not meet the demands of the economically and demographically expanding households. As the government has resumed undertaking similar projects, a changed approach where it can play the role of a facilitator and encourage people's participation is needed. This paper is based on the findings of an on-going study on the social housing schemes in Oman. Besides over viewing the public housing in Oman, it identifies problems of social housing and suggests changes in the policy and practice.

AB  - Climate change requires our built environment to be adaptable in order to serve the community well. Among the components of the built environment, housing and its occupants are especially vulnerable. Over the years, there have been variations in the designs and building techniques used in the construction of houses able to adapt to these changes. In this study, a systematic review with the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) protocol was conducted to identify, classify, and investigate existing climate-adaptive measures for housing on the basis of 65 articles selected. In total, 21 climate-adaptive measures were identified and classified into three categories, namely, passive design, building technology, and building performance assessment tools. From the identified climate-adaptive measures, 16 distinct benefits were identified, the majority of which are related to improved thermal comfort and energy efficiency. This review lays the foundation for further research examining the roles of existing, new, and emerging technologies in enhancing building performance and the adaptive ability of houses in response to climate change.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine whether a 'housing first' permanent supported accommodation was effective in improving housing stability, continuity of care and reducing mental health admissions for persons experiencing chronic homelessness with psychosis. Methods: A quasi prospective cohort study of 42 chronic homeless persons with psychosis accommodated in a new purpose built facility in central Melbourne. Accommodation stability, mental health service contacts and psychiatric admissions were compared across the 2 years prior, the first 2 years of placement and the 2 years after leaving. Results: The mean number of mental health admissions in the first 2 years of accommodation was less (0.56, SD = 1.0) when compared with in the 2 years prior to accommodation (1.0, SD = 1.4, p = 0.05). There was an increase in the mean total number of days admitted in the 2 years after having left the supported accommodation, (33.3 days, SD = 86.7, p = 0.043) Conclusions: The accommodation of chronic homeless persons with psychosis in a 'housing first' permanent supported accommodation lead to increased housing stability and optimism, improved continuity of care and reduced psychiatric admissions.

AB  - A longer life span, which entails a dynamic increase in the numbers of seniors, poses a wide range of global challenges, among others for engineers and architects. The said challenges include, among others, a well-organised medical care system, proper legislation and social education. The respective planning process should also recognise the important role of a well-designed environment. This paper is intended to analyse the current senior housing solutions in Poland and to define the desirable development of those housing forms that can successfully meet the needs of future seniors. For this purpose, we have analysed the current structure of elderly care. Further, this research was conducted using the diagnostic poll method ("Housing needs of the future seniors"), in order to define the current housing preferences of the young (future seniors). The results thereof provide relevant guidance in the search for spatial solutions that can ensure a high-quality housing environment for seniors in the future, which, at the same time, will facilitate their independent living.

AB  - Housing wealth dominates the asset portfolios of the older population in Australia and many other countries. Given the anticipated spike in fiscal costs associated with population ageing, there is growing policy interest in housing equity withdrawal (HEW) to finance living needs in retirement. This paper sheds light on homeowners' perceptions of the obstacles associated with two forms of HEW: mortgage equity withdrawal (where the in situ home owner increases his/her housing-related debt) and downsizing (where housing equity is released by moving to a lower-valued property). We uncover a series of age-specific barriers impeding older Australians' use of these forms of HEW through qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with home owners and professional service providers in related areas of policy and practice. To that end, we recommend the development of a range of safeguards that will minimise the risk exposure and other obstacles associated with HEW for older home owners.

AB  - Although many studies have shown that housing wealth impacts household consump-tion behavior patterns, they have not incorporated housing characteristics into their research framework. Against the background of China's reformed housing system, this study therefore constructs a theoretical framework of housing differences, credit constraints, and household energy consumption by adopting sample data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) of 7064 households in 25 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. Multiple regression methodology is used based on the emission peak and carbon neutrality goal proposed by the Chinese government in 2021. The results show that housing differences significantly impact household energy consumption; housing assets have a significant wealth effect on household energy consumption; energy consumption of house owners increases due to the appreciation of their housing; and that the housing proportion of a household's gross assets has a significant negative impact on household energy consumption. Furthermore, based on spatial distribution, it is found that the energy consumption level of households with housing properties in the developed regions of central and eastern China is significantly higher than that in the western regions. The study provides empirical evidence for China to build a linkage mechanism between energy policy and real estate policy and provides empirical support for the implementation of differentiated policies of energy consumption.

AB  - In Korea, the housing issues faced by young renters negatively impact both their parents and themselves. This study aimed at exploring young renters' situations whereby they receive financial support from their parents in order to pay current housing expenses, and their perception of housing cost burdens. Additionally, this study examined the influences on the reception of parental support and their perceived housing cost burdens. In February and March of 2021, an online questionnaire survey was conducted amongst young renters living independently from their parents and 385 responses from Jeonse renters and monthly renters with deposits in private rental housing units were analyzed. The major findings are as follows: (1) among the subjects, 43.4% had experienced receiving parental support in order to pay for housing expenses since their first instance of independent living, and 35.6% were still receiving parental support. (2) A discriminant model with a linear combination of the variables of age, income, residential location and rental deposit was found effective in predicting the receipt of parental support with 66.5% accuracy. (3) A linear combination of the variables of gender, rental deposit and monthly cash housing expenses was found to explain 5.8% of the total variance of perceived housing cost burdens. The results imply the necessity to expand the provision of public housing and housing subsidies to alleviate the financial burdens of young renters and their parents.

AB  - The need for quality housing is a dream of the younger generation because housing is a basic need in their transition to living independently. The transition to independent living usually occurs due to job demand, family formation, educational reasons and entry to homeownership. Nevertheless, this group of people faces several housing issues, such as failure to access their preferred housing tenure, difficulty purchasing their own home, and inability to access rental housing. Most of them, especially those residing in urban areas have encountered difficulties in attaining independent housing of their choice due to various problems. They have failed to access adequate and affordable homes which has resulted them renting private residences, sharing accommodation with their friends, continuing to reside in their parental homes or, even worse, becoming homeless. A survey, involving about 396 respondents, was carried out to investigate the challenges faced by the younger generation in their pursuit of adequate housing which in turn helps them achieve independent living. The discussion of the challenges highlighted offers possible strategies to resolve the housing issues haunting this generation.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the relationship between the housing market and consumer spending for the eleven standard regions of the UK. Pooled regional cross-sectional and annual time-series data are used to appraise the effect of housing assets on regional consumer spending in the 1980s. A fixed effects estimator imposing common slope coefficients across the regions is employed, and this assumption is tested using the SURE estimator. Estimates of a DHSY specification of the consumption function and a model augmented with housing assets are compared. The fixed effects models perform quite well indicating that the growth in regional housing equity has had a positive impact on regional consumer spending. The SURE results indicate that the assumption of common regional responses of consumer spending to the explanatory variables is not valid, and that the housing wealth effect is strongest in the East Midlands and the South East regions, although they should be treated with caution due to the short time span of the regional data.

AB  - Satisfactory housing conditions define, in many aspects, people's comfort and a high standard of living. The psychological and social characteristics of residents strongly determine housing needs and preferences. They also depend on economic, spatial, technical, and cultural factors. The Covid-19 pandemic, which humankind had been experiencing for two years, influenced all spheres of human life, especially inhabitation. The functional program of homes has changed, as well as public spaces, transportation and social ties. While the future is uncertain, the many changes provoked by the pandemic might become irreversible.This paper aims to present how the phenomena mentioned above have influenced the housing environment and residential preferences and trends that may follow. A survey conducted among Cracow residents in Autumn 2021 revealed a significant shift in lifestyles that corresponded with the change in residential needs, preferences and attitudes towards the housing environment. Working from home has induced redefining the use of particular rooms/spaces. For safety, families attempted to reorganize the entrance zone. Outdoor public spaces have become more appreciated following the trend of healthier everyday life. Over the long term, the pandemic experience may significantly influence the residential market.

AB  - Housing quality is known to be related to subjective well-being (SWB), but much less is known how this relationship varies with national contexts. This study addresses the association between housing tenure and housing quality on the one hand and the SWB of older Europeans on the other, given the differences in housing markets across Europe. Data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe were used, and linear regression models of SWB were estimated for 16 European countries. The findings indicate that being a renter is negatively related to SWB, while having a large house is positively associated with it. The negative effect of being a renter on SWB is small in several countries with accessible and well-regulated rental markets. Moreover, the difference in SWB between older people with a small and a large dwelling is somewhat smaller in countries with a high level of housing quality than in countries with lower housing quality. For each of our housing indicators, however, we also found countries for which the findings deviated from the general pattern. The findings imply that housing-market characteristics matter to how housing relates to SWB and, therefore, that housing-market interventions might affect this relationship.

AB  - This paper seeks to predict the impact of future housing supply on the affordability of residential space in the United Kingdom, using quantitative model-based simulation methods. Our spatially disaggregated analysis focuses on the greater South East region, approximately within 1.5 hours commuting time from Central London. A dynamic spatial panel model is applied to account for observed temporal variations in property prices and housing affordability across districts. The dynamic structure of this model allows us to assess the scale and extent of knock-on effects of local supply shocks in one district on other districts in the region. These complex spatial effects have been largely ignored in local or regional housing market forecasting models to date. Applying this model, we are able to demonstrate that local house prices and affordability are not only determined by the underlying supply and demand conditions in the market in question, but also depend crucially on conditions in neighbouring housing markets whose properties can be considered close substitutes within a larger regional housing market. We also show that increasing housing supply in the most critical areas has little impact on (both local and regional) affordability, even if wages do not change in response to an increase in employment.

AB  - This paper studies actual (real) house prices relative to fundamental (real) house values. Such a focus is warranted since housing constitutes a large fraction of most household portfolios, and its characteristics are such that, in contrast to what prevails in financial markets, arbitrage will be limited and hence correction toward 'true' value is likely to be a prolonged process. Using UK data and a time-varying present value approach, our results preclude the existence of an explosive rational bubble due to non-fundamental factors. We further find that intrinsic bubbles have an important role to play in determining actual house prices although price dynamics appear to impact, particularly in periods of strong deviation from fundamental value. Price dynamics are found to be driven by momentum behaviour.

AB  - Soaring homeownership and housing prices have made it more difficult for newcomers to climb the housing ladder without parental support. This study relies on China Household Finance Survey microdata in 2015 to examine the role of parental attributes (PA) and financial support on adult children's homeownership attainment. Results show that, after controlling for covariates, parental lending for housing would triple the adult children's odds of homeownership. Parental financial support plays a marginal role in maintaining homeownership. Adult children are more likely to transfer income to their parents than to receive, which is detrimental to the adult children's homeownership. The relative importance of PA is secondary to that of parental support and the adult children's institutional attributes-hukou status and access to housing provident fund. While the housing market is maturing, some advantages embedded in the socialist institutional arrangements have persisted. Young adults and rural migrants, who are burdened by financially supporting their parents, will struggle more in their housing careers.

AB  - Recent research has shown that divorce reduces the likelihood of home-ownership. Even in later life, ever-divorced men and women display lower home-ownership rates than their married counterparts. There is, however, a lack of knowledge about the consequences of divorce for a majority of divorcees: those who remain in home-ownership or move back into home-ownership after an episode in rental housing. This paper investigates the economic costs of divorce by focusing on the housing wealth of ever-divorced home-owners in later life (age 50 and over), against the background of changing welfare and housing regimes. The empirical analysis is based on data from ten European countries that participated in the third and fourth waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE 2007/8 and 2011/2). Our analyses support an association between divorce experience and lower housing wealth holdings for men and women who remain in home-ownership after a divorce, or re-enter home-ownership after a spell in rental housing. This means that a divorce has negative housing consequences for a broader range of individuals than thus far assumed. In countries with a dynamic housing market and a deregulated housing finance system, ever-divorced home-owners are worse off than their married counterparts. In these countries, more elderly individuals with a weaker financial situation are able to remain in or regain access to (mortgaged) home-ownership, but at the cost of lower housing equity. Further research should focus on the implications (e.g. for wellbeing, economic position) of such cross-country variations.

AB  - The paper deals with "housing issues" concerning the lower social strata of Vienna and Budapest in the period from 1848 to 1918. Housing, in general, was at that time significantly affected by various developments such as demographic changes, migration to cities, urbanisation, the spread of new ideas about the concept of family, state influence on housing, etc. In connection with the increased urbanisation in Vienna and Budapest, as well as in many other cities, the demand for apartments grew faster than their supply. The housing conditions of the lower, working classes in Budapest as well as in Vienna were affected by general overcrowding as well as by a lack of healthy and inexpensive small apartments. As shown in the example of treating homelessness, the measures against poverty were initially limited to mere repressive police actions. In addition, the housing shortage was at first handled within the framework of health and safety policy measures, based on thinking of bourgeois reformers on housing and the social sphere. Their primary goal was to ensure the stability of social conditions in general.

AB  - Is the common pressure group and media refrain that we are all two pay cheques away from homelessness' justified by the evidence? Drawing on multivariate analysis of two cross-sectional datasets (the Scottish Household Survey' and the UK-wide Poverty and Social Exclusion') Survey and one longitudinal data-set (the British Cohort Study 1970'), this paper provides a systematic account of the social distribution of homelessness in the UK. Informed by a critical realist explanatory framework, our analysis underlines the centrality of poverty, especially childhood poverty, to the generation of homelessness, while also demonstrating the impact of broader labour and housing market contexts, and certain demographic, personal and social support characteristics. These findings reinforce the moral imperative for policy action on homelessness, while at the same time signalling opportunities to target preventative interventions on high risk groups.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if homeless men with psychosis in central Melbourne have spent a greater proportion of the past 12 months in homeless settings as compared with the same group 15 years previously. Method: A 12-month accommodation history was collected from all men with psychosis assessed by a homeless outreach mental health team over a 12-month period commencing 2018 and compared with data from 2006. Results: Between 2006 and 2018, the percentage of time spent homeless in the previous 12 months rose from 50% to 80% (p = 0.0001). The mean time spent shelterless increased from 72 days to 149 days (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: The amount of time spent homeless has increased in men with psychosis assessed in central Melbourne. This finding suggests that men with psychosis are becoming increasingly entrenched in homeless settings. Addressing this trend requires an increased emphasis on assertive outreach, greater access to acute inpatient and long-term rehabilitation units, and more low cost affordable housing, including housing first facilities.

AB  - In this study, academic staff residential buildings were studied as part of a university campus located in a hot and humid climate zone in Turkiye. Within the scope of the study, the energy efficient architec-tural and landscape design decisions of the buildings built in 1976 were examined. The aim was to determine the energy performance of buildings built about 50 years ago and to quantify the effect of chang-ing landscape conditions on thermal comfort. In this aim, the outdoor thermal comfort level was determined by creating microclimate simu-lations for the hottest day and time of the year. Microclimatic analy-ses were performed with ENVI-met software and thermal comfort was evaluated with two metrics, average PMV and ASHRAE scale. The energy performance of the buildings was determined using ecological design parameters. An approach to global environmental problems is the use of ecological design principles, including architectural and landscape design principles. It is important to consider both architec-tural design criteria and landscape design criteria when discussing an ecological design in the built environment. Architectural and land-scape design decisions for hot and humid climate regions together increased energy efficiency by 51.1% to 75.5%. It was found that although the plant design improves energy performance in buildings by that range value, it improved outdoor thermal comfort by 15% to 22%. As a result, the study evaluated climate-balanced plant design with building energy performance in order to improve outdoor ther-mal comfort.

AB  - The urban environment, linked with human health, is a complex system disturbed by the roughness of the urban surface, unusually marked by buildings and greenbelts. The cooling effect of greenbelts inevitably responds to the distance from their locations to buildings and their characteristics, while the buildings are hardly independent of the greenbelts in terms of heat effects. To determine the role of building and greenbelt characteristics in mitigating heat stress, our study selected 3 greenbelts and 6 buildings in Beijing, China, and classified them into 2 clusters to compare the difference in monitored outdoor air temperatures (ATs) within two different building characteristics - height and length. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the least significant difference (ISD) were then employed to further test for significant difference. Our study indicates that each of the two characteristics (height and length) can bring about a significant hindering impact on greenbelt cooling effects. A greater building height or length has a greater hindering force to air (heat) flow. Knowing one or more of the characteristics of greenbelts or buildings is very critical to the improvement of the urban heat environment. Our study proposes an effective and practical outcome for facilitating governmental policy-making and planners' actions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cleveland, Ohio's Slavic Village is a shrinking neighborhood within a shrinking city that, in recent years, garnered national attention as an epicenter of the foreclosure crisis. High vacancy rates, deferred maintenance, vandalism, and low market-values present challenges to neighborhood leaders and policymakers. While demolition has dominated policy discourses in shrinking cities, Slavic Village's built environment is the tangible manifestation of the community's rich working-class and immigrant heritage. Thus, this research asks: In an era of urban shrinkage, what role do heritage and historic preservation play in stabilizing or revitalizing shrinking neighborhoods? Drawing on a qualitative case study of Slavic Village, the findings show that neighborhood leaders value heritage, yet historic fabric is in peril as traditional preservation regulations and incentives are insufficient given the scale of devastation. For historic preservation to retain relevance in places like Slavic Village, the profession needs to consider new, creative, even radical approaches that respond to the challenges of urban shrinkage.

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that mental health disorders in children are increasing and that they are spending more time within the built environment. This paper explores the potential benefits of implementing interior green walls in schools on the anxiety, stress, mood and well-being of children. Analysis of primary data was conducted to broaden the understanding of exterior and interior nature elements currently used in London elementary schools. Secondary data was collected and analysed to explore the impacts of indoor plants, interior green walls and nature views on anxiety, stress, mood and well-being. Additionally, secondary data was analysed to explore the hypothesis that the length of exposure to a nature element impacts positively on well-being. The key findings indicate that nature elements do immediately reduce levels of stress, anxiety and increase well-being and mood. Stress and anxiety levels were most positively influenced in the presence of a window view and indoor plants. While the benefits of the nature element on mood and well-being were noted to reduce after 2-5 weeks of exposure. This research highlights the benefits of introducing nature elements into the built environment in order to increase well-being for elementary school age children, however, further research is required to ensure these benefits are maximised.

AB  - Green roofs and green and living walls are increasingly seen in cities, because they are an important strategy that addresses some key urban environmental issues and allows the achievement of different benefits. Among these, the most relevant ones are reduction of the "Urban Heat Island" effect, of rainfall contributions to the sewer system, of environmental impact and energy saving, and retention of harmful substance. The study aims to analyze different systems of greenery systems integrated (GSI), green roofs (GR), and green and living walls (GW-LW), as a possible retrofit technique of the envelope of heritage buildings and especially their applications in the context of historic cities in Italy, pointing out positive and negative aspects. Particularly, it pays attention to the green retrofitting of buildings and to the technical problems related to the installation of systems, since at the moment there are already several studies that show the environmental and microclimatic benefits of the integration of vegetation in architecture. This study tries to highlight the series of design procedures necessary both in the preliminary phase and then in the executive phase to relate the GSI to the existing building envelopes. The GR, from the results of the simulations conducted, demonstrate a greater simplicity in their construction, with improvements also from the point of view of the working loads on the existing structures, since the interventions are performed more easily than those on the facade. The study highlights the architectural needs that are not always considered such as the increase in the thickness of the roof and the related need to raise its edges, changing the perspective of the building. On the other hand, the GW and the LW show some complexity in their construction because they must deal with facades often rich in decorative elements and where openings affect the assemblage and connection works such as the tinsmiths of the intrados of the openings. It must be taken into consideration the necessity of having to drill masonry, often inhomogeneous, to connect fixings and the problems of stability this entails must be carefully analyzed.

AB  - In recent years, the rapid development of the world's economy has led to the large-scale development and utilization of ecological resources on the earth, due to which the ecological environment has been continuously and seriously damaged, resulting in the waste of resources, soil erosion, land desertification, etc. To avoid further damage to the ecological environment and ecological resources, improve the utilization rate of ecological resources, and ensure the sustainable development of human society, it is necessary to evaluate the ecological environment. In this study, we collected the required data using the Delphi method and remote sensing technology. Secondly, the green Olympic building evaluation system (which refers to the CASBEE method in Japan) was used to evaluate the impact of green roofs on architectural design and the urban ecological environment. Third, a deep learning (DL)-based hybrid model, which consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short-term memory (SLSTM), known as CNN-LSTM, was used to evaluate the impact of green roofs on urban ecology and building architectural design. The influence of thermal comfort on the indoor environment of green roof buildings was studied. For experimentation, six samples of Shanghai Thumb Plaza, Splendid Tesco Point, Chaoshan Yuan Hotel, Green Management Office, Huangpu District Domestic Waste Transfer Station, and Changning District Fuxin Slaughterhouse were selected as evaluation objects, and the effect of green roofs on building design and urban ecology was evaluated from six levels: ecological, ornamental, safety, functional, social, and economic. Both the CASBEE and DL-based methods, CNN-LSTM, performed well and increased the evaluation results to some extent. The CNN-LSTM model increased the accuracy of the system by 3.55%, precision by 3.50%, recall by 4.46%, and F1-score by 3.30%. Overall, this study summarizes the existing problems of green rooftop buildings in Shanghai at this stage, which is conducive to formulating optimization strategies to improve the ecological benefits of green roof buildings and has important practical significance for realizing the sustainable development of human society.

AB  - Deep neural network technology is a major breakthrough in the field of automatic speech processing in recent years. Compared with other traditional models, deep neural network has a higher system recognition function. But it is undeniable that its DNN structure is also susceptible to performance degradation due to the impact of training conditions and test conditions. Speaker adaptation is the best way to solve such problems. Therefore, in speech recognition, the voice of different speakers should be distinguished and separately recognized and designed, so as to distinguish different speakers. This is also the key research direction of current speech recognition. In the current large-scale development process of the construction industry, the main reasons are the lack of people's concept of green building and the lack of attention to green building technology. Optimize the integration and other aspects to carry out key work to promote the control of high energy consumption and high pollution. In the design and application of green buildings, visitors cannot better understand the intention and application of green buildings by relying solely on schematic drawings and language descriptions. Therefore, VR technology is used in this paper to transform the virtual effect into a more real VR experience by setting up scene simulation. VR technology and speech recognition are combined to enhance the real look and feel of the simulation according to the discrimination of different speakers, so that visitors can be inside the building and truly feel the design and application of green buildings.

AB  - The paper aims to take forward recent research concerning the development of grassroots innovations and sustainability transitions in housing. We introduce and empirically assess a multi-level, process-oriented framework informed by strategic niche management (SNM) and social capital theory. Drawing on qualitative data, the empirical part explores the emergence of community-led housing (CLH) in England as a grassroots-based housing niche which operates in a context of market dysfunction. The paper offers further conceptual development of the role of intermediaries in grassroots niche building. Our findings suggest an evolution from independent sub-niche umbrellas to broader-based intermediaries to leverage and consolidate different sustainability practices in the niche. The results question an unadapted application of the simplistic growth-oriented SNM approach advocating for strategic coherence. In particular, our analysis shows that the development of broader-based intermediary organisations is driven by short-term government funding and carefully preserves the diversity of approaches and identities within the niche.

AB  - Since reunification, Berlin planners have sought to find a niche for a post-industrial New Berlin integrated into Europe. While great scholarly attention has focused on the grand projects that have dominated the reconstruction of the city's government and downtown commercial districts, only lesser attention has been paid to the city's housing and social policies. This article seeks to identify the extent to which Berlin planners have permitted unabated market-led redevelopment to proceed and to what extent local policy has sought more balanced redevelopment and the "European city" ideal. The article looks at gentrifying Prenzlauer Berg, in eastern Berlin, to assess the extent to which public policy measures can be expected to constrain and temper, and not just promote, gentrification. The role played by community development organizations in mediating development is observed. The impact of the city's fiscal crisis and slack housing market are also noted.

AB  - A surge of forcibly displaced migrants into Europe in 2015 culminated in what has been referred to as the 'refugee crisis'. As the continent's top destination country, Germany has been widely praised for its welcoming culture while heavily criticized for failures of integration. This is particularly true of Berlin - a city that has absorbed the highest number of war refugees in Europe, many of whom remain without stable accommodation. Despite its significance, the scholarship has largely neglected the housing question within the European refugee crisis. The aim of this article is to cast a critical light on the complexities and contradictions glossed over by the refugee crisis trope. Drawing on the Berlin case, the author argues that resettlement initiatives need to be understood against the backdrop of austerity urbanism, particularly its insistence that markets can meet housing demand. By focusing on three types of shelter provisioning for refugees, the article reveals the multifaceted and nuanced ways in which the Berlin government, refugees and grassroots organizations contest, produce and navigate the moving frames of austerity urbanism in search of stable housing.

AB  - Custom-built solutions for ageing, urban regeneration, energy efficiency, thermal performance, and well-being are contemporary challenges that have prompted considerable research over the past decades. In the construction field, subjects such as energy efficiency and thermal performance are often addressed within the scope of mandatory regulations, the suitability of construction solutions and the incorporation of technical equipment. Considering four residential structures for older adults under construction in Portugal, this paper aims to highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach to these issues, including architectural quality as the main target. In pursuit of this, a cohesive set of intervention principles guided the analysis: the adaptive reuse of raw materials; taking advantage of the site's conditions; vegetation (type and location); construction options and durability; solar exposure and shading; the pedagogy of building use; and the comfort and thermal perception. Several reflections emerge from the analysis: good architectural design must consider dynamic models incorporating each context and the site's conditions; the culture of use and maintenance and the notion of "adaptive comfort" are primary factors to enhance thermal performance and energy efficiency; and each building is a unique result of a complex negotiation process. Bridging research through practice, and multidisciplinary scientific integration enable engagement with reality and raise awareness of the constraints and challenges to innovation in LTC design.

AB  - Purpose - Building performance does not only depend on its efficiency but also on the behaviors of its occupants. Occupant behaviors can more than offset technological efficiency gains so, that corporate real estate (CRE) managers have to go beyond sustainable buildings. CRE managers need to understand occupants to effectively reduce the environmental impact of their building portfolio. This paper aims to investigate the effects of environmental attitudes and mindfulness on occupant behaviors at home and at the office. Thereby, the authors address numerous calls for research regarding the drivers of more environmental real estate user behaviors. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use partial least squares structural equation modeling based on self-report data obtained for a representative German sample. Findings - The results show that environmental attitudes and mindfulness have both positive effects on occupant behaviors. However, the effects tend to be weaker in the office context. Research limitations/implications - This study relies on self-reports as an indicator of actual behaviors. Besides, the findings are limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data. Practical implications - Environmental education and mindfulness training may be an effective way to promote more environmental occupant behaviors and help CRE managers to further reduce the environmental impact of their building portfolio. Originality/value - The paper contributes to prior research about the antecedents of environmental behaviors and provides evidence for the positive impact of environmental attitudes and mindfulness on occupant behaviors. The author provide a new approach for CRE managers, which may improve occupant behaviors.

AB  - When publishing official population statistics, many national statistical organisations define small areas termed 'building blocks' which are then aggregated into larger 'output zones' for data release. While output zones are known to have enormous influence on spatial analysis, there has not been any systematic analysis of the effect of building blocks on characteristics of output zones. This paper evaluates current international practice in building block design, identifying key conceptual and practical issues. Using the example of six local authorities in England and Wales, it employs automated zone design to evaluate the influence of two sets of building blocks (street blocks and postcodes) on output zone characteristics. Household-level census data, accessed under secure conditions, are used to evaluate the impact on both newly designed and maintained output zones. Postcodes are shown to be more effective building blocks than street blocks, providing more uniform population and household sizes, greater precision for matching postcoded data to census data, and enabling more zones to be maintained. However, street blocks deliver more compact output zones and greater internal homogeneity of tenure and accommodation type. The scale effect of the modifiable areal unit problem and the specific geographical patterning of variables are both shown to be important factors when designing building blocks. These findings have directly informed policies and processes for the 2011 Census in England and Wales and provide useful conceptual and practical guidance for any national statistical organisation or analyst designing their own building blocks. The paper concludes that some aspects of international building block design practice could be more effectively harmonised but that such design should always be nationally specific to incorporate locally varying conceptual and practical issues. Further research should extend this analysis to other building block types, notably grid squares.

AB  - Scholars have long argued that gentrification may displace long-term homeowners by causing their property taxes to increase, and policy makers, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have cited this argument as a justification for state laws that limit the increase of residential property taxes. We test the hypotheses that gentrification directly displaces homeowners by increasing their property taxes, and that property tax limitation protects residents of gentrifying neighborhoods from displacement, by merging the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with a decennial Census-tract-level measure of gentrification and a new data set on state-level property tax policy covering the period 1987 to 2009. We find some evidence that property tax pressure can trigger involuntary moves by homeowners, but no evidence that such displacement is more common in gentrifying neighborhoods than elsewhere, nor that property tax limitation protects long-term homeowners in gentrifying neighborhoods. We do find evidence that gentrification directly displaces renters.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to identify areas that are possibly gentrified or in the process of being gentrified, through a localized typology of two components: youthification and an increase in the quality of life. This typology can be applied in similar investigations. Thisd paper addresses the case study of the Metropolitan Center of the City of Monterrey (CMM), Nuevo Leon, Mexico. The current urban regeneration plans and the increase of housing density in the CMM have caused a vertical real estate "boom" of apartment buildings and have strengthened the emergence of gentrification in the area, understood here as the decrease in social backwardness (increase in the quality of life) over time, with an increase in young adults (25 to 34 years-old), compared to older adults (60+ years-old). This article suggests a procedure to measure gentrification by overlapping the Index of Social Backwardness (ISB) at the Basic Geostatistical Area (AGEB) level, with a youthification index at the electoral section level between the 2010-2020 period. Both the decline of social backwardness (2010-2020) and youthification (2010-2020), are analytically articulated for successive census years, to generate a localized typology of the gentrification process.

Higher-income women were gentrifiers from the beginning and lower-income men were more likely to be displaced. The factors driving gentrification are also transforming the rest of the metropolitan area, making the continuation of gentrification appear inevitable unless aggressive social housing programs are implemented to secure tenure for lower-income households and help mitigate the loss of lower priced housing in the inner city.

AB  - Generative design (GD) has gained widespread attention in the built environment domain, revolutionising traditional methodologies in the field. It operates on a set of rules, utilising algorithmic and parametric modelling techniques to explore and enhance design options. By determining the existing challenges and ongoing research in 85 representative papers, this paper seeks to explore the implications of GD within built environment, sustainability, BIM, and AI design practices, clarifying its potential to shape a more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive built environment for future generations. It contributes to the dialogue surrounding the utilisation of GD as a tool for building and infrastructure design practices via a content analysis-based review method. Incorporating advanced technologies could facilitate a more effective and immediate response to design methodologies, thus promoting enhanced innovation and sustainability in design practices. The selection of, and proficiency in, programming languages constitute important aspects in advancing GD aligned with built environment objectives.

AB  - In the built environment, quality contains functional, formal, structural, and economic aspects. Functional quality includes space planning, value, usage styles, inter-space relations, accessibility, flexibility, transformability, spatial satisfaction perceptions of the users, and the way users use the space. Formal quality contains aesthetics, perception (cultural values and cognitive factors), adaptability to the age, and compatibility with the context. Structural quality involves the structural design, durability, appropriate materials and construction techniques, sustainable-environmental friendliness, and lastly economic quality comprises the planning budget, construction budget, operating budget, and investment value. Determining whether a building is of quality requires an evaluation. In this study, the gap model, one of the service quality models was considered as a base for measuring the quality of the architectural structure. The main elements of the gap model were transformed. The expected service changed to expected architectural quality, expected service converted to perceived architectural quality, and satisfying quality transformed into satisfying performance for users and employers. Then new gaps were proposed that were adapted to measure expected and perceived quality in architectural buildings. Thus, a framework was presented that measures the functional, formal, structural, and economic quality of the structure and provides an understanding of the expectations of the user and employer.

AB  - Chilean housing policy has suffered a profound transformation during the last decades. In the sixties and the beginning of the seventies a model emerged based on community attributes, promoting community organization and the construction of well-provided neighborhoods that, in addition, had abundant public space. In 1973, the focus shifted with the implementation of a subsidiary model that promoted single-family and individual solutions and payed far less attention to the collective development of the residential habitat. Although the continuation of this model until today has significantly reduced the housing shortage, it has been unable able to reproduce a residential space of community ties. This article aims to investigate the impacts of both models on the configuration, use and appropriation of the public space and the neighborhood sociability of the residents through a multi-methods analysis of two social housing projects located in Santiago de Chile. The findings reaffirm the relevance of the history and the organization of the neighborhoods, but also confirm the significance of planned public spaces and the arrangement of the built environment as dimensions that can promote or suppress social practices.

AB  - Cities are growing dramatically. At the same time, we are witnessing the obsolescence of the existing building stock due to its low performance in terms of structural stability, energy efficiency and, last but not least, beauty. Especially in Italy, a highly seismic country, most of the buildings erected between the 1950s and the 1980s are not only earthquake-prone but also aesthetically unpleasant. In this perspective, the urgency of improving the existing building stock in terms of seismic vulnerability opens up the opportunity to also work on its architectural image. This article draws from the assumption that the search for beauty represents an important and often neglected dimension of the search for sustainability. In particular, the presented study suggests and combines the use of parametric design and the structural shape of steel exoskeletons to renovate a typical earthquake-prone apartment block from the 1960s in Italy. The results show that the proposed parametric approach can provide and select different effective renovation solutions.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between housing satisfaction and low-income tenants' willingness to pay rental fees in government-owned rental apartments (GORAs), a form of social housing in Indonesia. Despite their sophisticated physical features and affordable rents, GORAs have experienced mounting arrears that burden the provincial maintenance budget. This situation contradicts the assumption that better quality housing will increase housing satisfaction and reduce the amount of rent nonpayment. By examining the situation in one GORA in Jakarta, Indonesia, this study reveals that the well-designed physical features of GORAs do not necessarily increase housing satisfaction, because the prototypical design's failure to accommodate aspects of the residents' sociocultural context and the prohibition of adjustments to the units diminish residents' financial capacity and their social ties. Consequently, their poor level of housing satisfaction contributes to the mounting levels of arrears. This study recommends a comprehensive review of existing housing policy to better accommodate residents' desired sociocultural activities and their potential means of generating revenue, thereby improving residents' welfare and potentially reducing the total amount of rent arrears.

In the case of the two leading contributors to that school, the fact that one (Saverio Muratori) taught the other (Gianfranco Caniggia) is a dominant theme. However, as in the history of ideas more generally, it is difficult to trace the various influence on the thinking of these key individuals. Ideas about culture, philosophy and architecture that were circulating in Italy, in particular in the 1920s and 1930s, helped to stimulate Muratori's fundamental conceptions of architectural organism, type, tissue and built environment, urban development process, territory and active history.

AB  - In the study of the reproduction of state power through urban space, more attention has been paid to how states organize urban space to construct the disciplined subject than the converse of how states cultivate subjects who reproduce the material and symbolic significance of the built environment. Using the case study of public housing in the developmental state of Singapore, I argue that states attempt to shape how inhabitants navigate and interpret the built environment by constructing spatial-political subjects who reproduce state hegemony through internalized mental and emotional schemas towards urban space. I analyze fifty years (1972-2021) and nearly 700 issues of periodicals by Singaporean housing authorities to illustrate two distinct phases of spatial-political subject formation which corresponded to deliberate shifts in the physical sites of state legitimacy. In the two decades following independence, the ruling People's Action Party sought legitimacy for its program of slum clearance and public housing "New Town" construction, and accordingly cultivated the modern urban resident oriented towards the rationally-planned New Town and the high-rise apartment. Faced with political opposition in the mid-eighties but having already housed 80% of Singapore, the PAP then shifted the stakes of legitimacy towards the maintenance of existing common areas and cultivated the sociable urban citizen who equated ongoing municipal maintenance with ruling party provision while actively participating in state-sanctioned neighborhood activities. The following findings will illuminate an overlooked strategy in the state's toolkit for reproducing its hegemony through urban space.

AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to discuss the issues and challenges related to housing continuity for individuals transitioning from homelessness to securing a place to live in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The aim of the study is to explore the problems and solutions in the context of housing policy, particularly as they pertain to homeless households. The study involves conducting in-depth interviews with various stakeholders involved in helping homeless households find shelter and access to public housing.Design/methodology/approachThe research methodology comprises a comprehensive literature review encompassing housing affordability, affordable housing and homelessness both within Malaysia and globally to identify research gaps. One of the key questions highlighted the effectiveness of existing programs aimed at providing short-term shelter and social integration for homeless individuals. Additionally, it highlights one of the primary challenges in this process, which is the tendency of homeless individuals to return to homelessness due to various factors. The data collection uses a qualitative approach and the data are obtained through in-depth interviews with key stakeholders responsible for assisting homeless households in Klang Valley, Malaysia, encompassing federal, state and local government representatives. Purposive sampling ensures diverse stakeholder representation. Interviews are structured semi-structured to maintain consistency while allowing for open-ended discussions on challenges and successes in facilitating homeless individuals' transition to stable housing. Thematic analysis of transcribed interview data focuses on recurring themes related to housing continuity, affordability and homeless households' behavioural patterns.FindingsThere are five (n = 5) stakeholders consist of local government (Code: R1), ministries (Code: R2; R5) and government agencies (Code: R3; R4). The study revealed that various programs have been implemented to provide short-term shelter and facilitate the integration of homeless individuals into society. Nevertheless, a significant challenge identified was the recurring tendency of homeless households to return to homelessness. This "behavioural direction" was found to be influenced by multiple factors which includes mental health and attitude problem. The findings emphasise the need for collaborative efforts among all stakeholders to address the issues and challenges related to housing continuity in Klang Valley.Originality/valueThe originality of this research lies in its focus on the specific and under-researched context of Klang Valley, Malaysia, regarding the critical issues of housing affordability and the challenges of housing continuity for homeless households. While housing affordability and affordable housing are widely recognised as global housing policy concerns, this study delves into a localised setting where limited attention has been given to understanding the transitions of homeless individuals to stable housing. The findings provide unique insights into the efforts and challenges faced in Klang Valley, shedding light on the behavioural patterns and factors contributing to recurring homelessness. This paper offers a context-specific perspective that contributes to the broader understanding of housing continuity issues.

AB  - This is a study of tenure choice, housing demand and mobility in the submarkets of the Helsinki metropolitan area. The empirical analysis is based on data on households, type of tenure, housing characteristics and mobility for a sample of Helsinki residents at the end of 1980s. According to our results the probability of owning is affected not only by user costs of alternative tenure forms but also by permanent income and demographic variables. Results from the tenure specific housing demand models indicate that there are non-neutralities in the housing markets. Permanent income elasticities of housing demand are clearly positive in owner-occupied sector and systematically higher than in the rented sector. The demand for owner-occupied housing depends very strongly on the age of the household head. User cost per housing unit affects housing demand negatively in both tenure forms. Effective demand is greater in private housing sector. The results suggest that owner-occupied living is preferred with heavily subsidized households the least likely to move. In the rental sector, where the probability of moving is higher, it is also true that the most heavily subsidized households are the least likely to move.

AB  - Cohousing is designed to promote mutual support. Members of 12 senior cohousing communities participated in an online nationwide survey, which included loneliness, social isolation, and satisfaction, as well as questions about experiences during the pandemic. The white and well-educated sample (n = 108) had a mean age of 72.52 (range = 55-94). About 12% were at risk of isolation; 19% were lonely. During COVID-19, participants took comfort from knowing others were near; 65% interacted with people every day. The majority reported mutual support was better here than where they lived previously. Almost all felt they were better off living in cohousing during this time.

AB  - The financialization of housing is central to understanding urban development and the processes of transnational gentrification occurring in the Global South. The city of Cuenca offers an emble-matic case, in which transnational investment has induced new processes of urbanization, much of it intended to attract higher-income consumers from the Global North. The transformation of its real estate market from a local one into a transnational one is led partly by Ecuadorian mi-gration to the Global North, but it is also accompanied by North-South lifestyle migration. Both groups have helped to propel real estate construction, especially of new, dense, high-rise condos. The article argues that Ecuador's attempt to boost its construction sector and expand mortgage credit through securitization of debts has helped to attract transnational pools of migrant wor-kers' savings to the built environment of its cities-notably Cuenca. Yet the benefits of urban housing investment are not shared by lower-income workers there, who continue to lack access to affordable housing.

AB  - The inadequate coverage of energy needs in the residential sector, known as energy poverty, is a primary socio-economic problem, worldwide. Especially in Greece, under the pressure of the recent economic crisis, households face serious difficulties in meeting sufficiently their energy needs. We will show that one long-term way to minimize energy consumption, and therefore, tackle energy poverty, is the turn to underground constructions. Although underground built space can offer important benefits in terms of energy demand and consumption, underground residences have been largely regarded as unusual, far from the common residence type. However, in Greece and especially in Greek islands, underground residences have been often used in order to deal with extreme heat, during summer. Moreover, since 2012, underground constructions have been introduced as a special residence type by the Greek building regulation, thus facilitating the expansion of such practice. In this paper, the benefits of an underground residence in terms of energy poverty are being examined. More specifically, energy consumption required to achieve desired energy standards is calculated both for an earth-sheltered and an aboveground residence of similar characteristics in Greece. In this way, an indicative energy poverty ratio is calculated for the two residence types. The different climatic conditions throughout the country have been taken into consideration, by examining different Climatic zones. The findings show lower energy poverty ratios in the case of the underground residence at all climatic zones. In other words, a household living in an underground dwelling can more easily meet its energy needs compared to another one living in an aboveground dwelling. Hence, the analysis shows that modern architecture design should more systematically turn to underground constructions, incorporating the advantages of bioclimatic performance and energy savings.

AB  - In the past, various strategies based on top-down approaches were employed to curb the housing crisis in less developed countries (LDCs), but most failed because they did not engage the community in development projects. During the 1980s, the UN launched the bottom-up approach, which emphasizes the involvement of community-based organizations in shelter projects. This approach promotes enabling strategies in an effort to overcome obstacles encountered under the top-down approach: namely displacement, affordability, cost-recovery, and replicability. This paper explores what LDCs are doing to implement the bottom-up approach, and this is accomplished by examining the cases of Nairobi, Kenya, and Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic. The study analyzes how the governments of both countries have responded to the policies promoted under the two approaches. Data on government policies are analyzed to find out whether the governments of Kenya and the Dominican Republic have provided an enabling environment for other actors. This study reveals that both governments have adopted enabling policies in their National Action Plans which include: facilitating the efforts of all actors in providing shelter; the use of non-conventional building materials; and the upgrading of low-income housing. This research shows that the bottom-up approach is more likely to be successful in overcoming factors that inhibit the provision of low-income housing as compared to the top-down approach.

AB  - This article identifies the key factors that influenced the consumer purchase behaviour of green-certified buildings in Brazil. To do this, a theoretical model was developed from three systematic literature reviews (SLR) on three literature streams (green buildings, traditional buildings, and green products) - alongside classical consumer behaviour model. The resulting model was then used to set up the hypotheses that were evaluated through a mixed-method approach based on in-depth interviews and a survey with Brazilian customers who had bought a green building certified apartment or house. Our findings showed that there were nine key factors that positively influenced their purchasing behaviour: motivation, knowledge, environmental attitude, values and personality, physical attributes, external environment, trust, lifestyle, and situation. They were motivated by the desire to live in a sustainable property, live in a more secure environment, own a home and leave a legacy for future generations; and having background information and knowledge about green buildings and a high degree of environmental attitude and sustainability related values and lifestyle. Our contribution is threefold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the key factors that influenced the actual behaviour of green building consumers in the Brazilian market, and one of the few that studies the actual buying behaviour rather than intention. It extends the extant literature by studying a more comprehensive set of factors and it contributes to the investigation of consumer behaviour of traditional and sustainable products in emerging markets.

It addresses the encroachment of urbanisation on limited agricultural land and explores historical urban settlements in the Jordanian desert, focusing on Jawa and Umm el-Jimal. The study classifies extracted sustainable strategies into three levels: strategic selection of suitable urbanisation sites, meticulous planning to ensure access to water, food, and improved microclimate, and building design considering environmental, functional, and social needs. To fully harness this region's potential, fostering collaboration among diverse stakeholders and conducting further research is crucial.

AB  - The promotion of local sustainable travel is ever prominent within local transport plans, although it is still not well understood how the change to more sustainable and less carbon-based travel can be achieved. The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of the travel choice mechanism following residential relocation. This paper uses a structural equations model and an ordered model to explore the drivers of public transport and walking use within an urban environment, using a quasi-longitudinal dataset from 10 communities in the metropolitan area of Tyne and Wear, in northeast England. The results show that changes in public transport use are determined by accessibility features of the built environment, alongside socio-demographic and travel attitude characteristics. Changes in walking, on the other hand, are determined mostly by built-environment characteristics. These findings suggest that a different approach is needed for the promotion of public transport use than for increasing walking trips (aside from walking to access public transport). The provision of public transport services needs to take into account the importance of the value of transport to users, to sufficiently attract and retain them. To promote walking, policy must focus on changes to the built environment (such as safety, travel accessibility, and the sociability of the environment), since it is changes in these characteristics that drive walking in the urban area.

AB  - Urban planning is transitioning away from the 'Predict and Provide' approach that accommodates automobility and towards the 'Demand Management' approach that prioritises alternatives that include active, shared, and public transport and restricts the convenience of automobility. While this transition could prove a sustainable solution for urban mobility, individuals already residing within auto-dependent settings may be unwilling or unable to relocate to high urban density where the alternatives are more viable. As such, restricting the automobility of these individuals potentially leaves them stranded throughout the urban form. The 'Multimodalism' approach is a pragmatic alternative that provides Park `n' Rides, Kiss `n' Rides, and feeder transit services that ensure everyone has access to rapid public transport yet the approach receives relatively little research attention. As such, researchers, policy makers, and planners are poorly equipped to influence intended multimodal travel behaviours or discourage the unintended such as 'railheading' towards more distantly located PnR. In this study, the transport planning and social psychology literature is examined to develop a conceptual model of travel behaviour, and for the first time, railheading behaviour is examined at the metropolitan-scale and explained using the conceptual model. The conceptual model and research findings strengthen the theoretical and empirical foundations for understanding travel behaviour, which in turn supports planning authorities and practitioners in promoting more sustainable transport behaviour, and in preparing for an urban future where Mobility-as-a-Service, ride-hailing, ride-sharing, eScooters, and autonomous vehicles become more integrated and commonplace.

AB  - This paper aims to explain changes in real house prices in Australia from 1970 to 2003. We develop and estimate a long-run equilibrium model that shows the real long-run economic determinants of house prices and a short-run asymmetric error correction model to represent house price changes in the short run. We find that, in the long run, real house prices are determined significantly and positively by real disposable income and the consumer price index. They are also determined significantly and negatively by the unemployment rate, real mortgage rates, equity prices and the housing stock. Employing our short-run asymmetric error correction model, we find that there are significant lags in adjustment to equilibrium. When real house prices are rising at more than 2 per cent per annum, the housing market adjusts to equilibrium in approximately four quarters. When real house prices are static or falling, the adjustment process takes six quarters.

AB  - Cool roofs have emerged as a solution to enhance thermal comfort in buildings, reducing the energy required for cooling and mitigating the urban heat island effect. In the context of rapid urbanization, balancing cooling demand while maintaining thermal comfort in buildings presents a significant challenge. This paper explores the impact of cool roofs on thermal comfort levels in low-income housing government schemes. The experiments were conducted during winter months to assess the potential reduction in thermal comfort in coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh, India. For the experimental work, a total of twelve houses (four in each location: Vizag, Kakinada, and Bapatla) were chosen based on similarities such as orientation, shading, obstacles, location, window or door positioning, construction, material used, opening and closing schedules of windows or doors, etc. The evaluation of cool roof impact involved measuring parameters like overdeck temperature, underdeck temperature, and indoor temperatures, alongside monitoring outdoor temperature. A maximum reduction of 12.8 degrees Celsius was observed in overdeck roof temperature, 9.2 degrees Celsius in underdeck roof temperature, and 4.3 degrees Celsius indoor air temperature for houses with cool roofs in comparison to houses with regular roofs. Insights from this study could inform improvements in building design and codes for structures catering to low-income groups, enabling more effective utilization of cool roof technology. This, in turn, could significantly enhance thermal comfort in large-scale low-income housing planned across the nation under various schemes.

Principal component analysis was applied to the questionnaire's internal structure, while regression analysis helped uncover housing affordability and housing prices perception predictors.FindingsThe study found that building regulation standards and zoning/land-use regulations reveal positive relationships with housing prices and housing affordability perception. Among these components, building regulations and standards show a stronger connection with housing affordability and price perception in comparison to urban planning and development.Research limitations/implicationsBy investigating the relationship between building regulations, urban planning, and housing affordability and price perception in Prishtina, the present research makes a valuable contribution to the existing literature. The findings of this research hold significant implications for policymakers, urban planners, and developers, highlighting the relevance of adopting a well-balanced approach to building regulations and urban planning in order to uphold and maintain housing affordability and understand housing price dynamics.Originality/valueThe novelty of this research originates from the investigation of these relationships within a rapidly urbanizing city context, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics between regulatory policies and outcomes in the housing market. Further research should examine additional dimensions and employ longitudinal designs to gain a deeper understanding of the components predicting housing affordability and price perception in Prishtina and similar urban contexts.

AB  - This research is concerns about the housing experiences of Pakistani immigrant labours in Malaysia including the access to adequate, affordable and suitable housing as a prominent aspect of successful settlement and integration. Malaysia is a popular country for Pakistani labour. However, few studies conducted to examine the barriers and challenges that Pakistani faced in Malaysia. To fill this gap, a qualitative research was employed on 21 Pakistani immigrant labours from Klang Valley, Malaysia. The responses regarding housing experiences were collected through interviews. Findings represented that few Pakistani were satisfied with the housing but the other prefer to live in the rental housing due to the inadequate and unsuitable housing provided by employers. They faced issues of damp properties, pest infiltration and over-crowding. In the rental market, they faced the issue of affordability. Social network played a significant role to handle these issues. Based on the finding, it is recommended that policy-makers should ensure the proper implementation of housing policies and update these policies as per requirement. For Malaysian government to succeed in retaining and attracting labour in Malaysia, they should make proper check and balance of adequate, affordable and suitable housing services provided by employers.

AB  - PurposeHousing sufficiency is a critical indicator of national development and growth. However, in most countries, housing affordability remains a significant challenge, leading to a mismatch between housing supply and demand. The purpose of this study is to investigate the housing preferences, current occupation and the resulting surplus and shortage across various housing types.Design/methodology/approachData were collected through a survey, and the analysis focused on quantifying the mismatch between preferred and occupied housing types.FindingsResults revealed significant disparities between housing preferences and current occupation, with some housing types experiencing surplus and others facing shortages. The findings uncovered a 23% discrepancy in housing demand and supply. The sensitivity results indicate that 30% of the respondents currently living in a particular type of housing unit would choose to live there if given the option. The specificity results show that 90% of respondents not living in a particular type of housing unit would continue to avoid choosing it. Housing price, income, ethnicity, race and location are the major drivers of the housing preferences.Practical implicationsDevelopers can align their projects with consumer preferences to minimize surplus and shortages. Financial institutions may consider these insights when tailoring mortgage products to meet the diverse needs of potential homebuyers. This research provides a valuable foundation for strategic planning and policy formulation aimed at enhancing housing sufficiency and socioeconomic development in Malaysia.Originality/valueThis study lays the foundation for future research and for incentive mechanisms for homebuyers and developers. The results are useful to policymakers, developers, banks, consultants, housing associations and academics.

AB  - Accommodations are commonly provided to address language-related barriers students may experience during testing. Research on the validity of scores from accommodated test administrations remains somewhat inconclusive. The current study investigated item response patterns to understand whether accommodations, as used in practice among English learners (ELs) in the United States, allow for comparable measurement between ELs and non-ELs. Results indicated that although significant differences are evident in overall test scores for ELs and non-ELs, only minimal measurement concerns were evident. Very few items displayed moderate or large differential item functioning (DIF); no tests showed small, medium, or large differential test functioning. The current study adds to existing literature on measurement comparability and accommodation research on ELs; implications for practice are provided.

Data are from the 2014 National Survey on Persons with Disabilities. We modelled four health and well-being outcomes - perceived stress, depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and life satisfaction - by various housing environments among 2,077 older adults with physical disabilities. The results illustrate that home ownership and perceived house accessibility are associated with health and well-being. Findings indicate that efforts to promote the health of older adults with physical disabilities need to be accompanied by improvements in their housing environment.

AB  - Background: As accommodation itself is an equity issue in varied contexts in and beyond education (e.g., the provision of assistive technology, extended time, or read-aloud), it is critical to examine the equitability of accommodation policies and practices by examining their effects on student performance. Aims: This study sought to assess the effectiveness of thirty-one bundled accommodations for students with learning disabilities, emotional or behavioral disorders, or multiple exceptionalities writing a provincial literacy test in Ontario, Canada. Methods and procedures: We employed quantitative methods of log-linear analysis and odds ratio to examine the data. To analyze sparse data, we compared three different adjustment methods to meet this methodological challenge. Outcomes and results: Our findings suggest that the problems with sparse data can be overcome by an adjustment method. We also found that the likelihood of achieving the provincial standards may differ among students with special needs depending on whether they did or did not receive certain combinations of accommodations for the literacy test. Conclusions and implications: We recommend that education stakeholders review the accommodations that produced significant differential effects to address the concerns regarding whether the test results were interpreted validly and fairly for students with special needs.

AB  - A method for formulating a rational reorganizing plan was examined. The first approach involved statistically determining the reorganization priority, which was applied to all public housing residential buildings in Kobe city to confirm its effectiveness. The second approach entailed creating a program that automatically ranks all combinations of housing units under consideration for reorganization, based on the required reconstruction costs and the potential for reducing the number of dwelling units and buildings. When this program was applied in the area, it yielded combinations of housing units that could reorganize more dwelling units at a lower cost.

AB  - Decarbonizing the economy is one of the main ambitions for the European Union. The construction sector contributes to global warming, during all buildings life cycle phases. Greenhouse gas emissions are present in the whole process of construction, use/operation and dismissing/demolishing. The Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an evaluation approach to assess CO2 and other greenhouse gases emissions during the whole life cycle of a building or product. The aim of this paper is to test the LCA methodology for the evaluation of environmental impacts of historic buildings, towards a circular economy approach in the adaptive reuse of cultural heritage. The case study is an abandoned monastery in Salerno, Italy. Results show that LCA can effectively inform the design phase of cultural heritage adaptive reuse, comparing different conservation and design alternatives.

AB  - This study presents an in-depth analysis of 69 case studies focusing on the energy retrofit of historic buildings, uncovering challenges, best practices, and lessons learned to balance energy efficiency improvements with heritage preservation. The findings highlight several challenges encountered during renovations, such as complex heritage evaluations, restrictions on alterations, coordination issues with authorities, technical limitations, higher investment costs, and knowledge gaps. On the other hand, identifying factors promoting renovation, including demonstrating energy savings while respecting heritage, early collaboration between planners and authorities, and quantifying investments, could incentivize owners and authorities. The limitations of a still-limited sample size, occasional incomplete data, and potential sample bias call for cautious interpretation of the presented analysis. Despite these, the study provides valuable insights into successful projects, emphasizing the need for scalability, knowledge transfer from innovative policies, and targeted policy-making for successful replication. The study concludes with a call for further development of the HiBERatlas (Historic Building Energy Retrofit atlas), an extensive resource for historic building renovation, expanding its database, collaborating with agencies, and tailoring guidance for stakeholders to foster energy retrofits in heritage buildings.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the implementation of 'Islamic built environment' (IBE) concept in public open spaces in Malaysia. Granting the development of IBE must be the basis in every concept of national development in Malaysia. Thus, this research believes that the adaptation of true Islamic concept is the very crucial in public open spaces that belong to the Malaysian community and for public use, besides being the focus of attraction and tourism assets. This research was conducted based on literatures on framework of indicators of truly Islamic environment. The evaluation was prepared through observation on ten indicators, namely (1) Tolerance, (2) Natural Environment, (3) Social Need and Human Comfort, (4) Religious Identity, (5) Order, (6) Economic, (7) Intellectual and Knowledge, (8) Hygiene, (9) Jannah, and (10) Safety in the selected open public spaces in Malaysia. This research employed a descriptive and survey-based research design rooted in quantitative and qualitative research paradigms. The procedure of research methodology is a combination of reviewing literature, data collection, and data analysis to determine the research finding. For data gathering, this research carried out a site survey for on-site observation confined to the context of landscape components in public open spaces. The findings of this research can benefit and guide Malaysian administrators and professionals in built environment industries to generate a better and more appropriate process of implementing an IBE in Muslim countries, particularly with regard to public open spaces.

AB  - The short-term rental market has grown rapidly over the last decade, led by the ascendance of Airbnb. The multifaceted impacts of short-term rentals, including increases in housing prices, changes in neighborhood character, and loses of revenue for hotels, have invited regulation from city governments. The City of New Orleans passed laws in December 2016 designed to regulate the short-term rental market and prevent further unfettered growth. This paper evaluates those regulations on the number and character of Airbnbs in the city prior to and after the enforcement of the laws. The regulations temporarily reduced the overall number of Airbnb's in New Orleans, but growth has resumed after a one-time decline. In addition, the regulations appear to have shifted growth into residential neighborhoods and away from the French Quarter.

AB  - Existing buildings present the best opportunity for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in developed economies, given that only 2-3% of the building stock is newly built each year. Insights from a post-occupancy evaluation of a large-scale refurbishment project of a head office building in Sydney, Australia, are presented to inform future refurbishment strategies. The study evaluates occupant satisfaction and energy performance, and elicits influencing factors arising from the design process and interventions, ongoing building management, and operational performance. Occupants returned a high level of satisfaction across the range of environmental variables for overall comfort, temperature, lighting, and air quality as well as perceived productivity and health. These outcomes highlight the importance of improving indoor environmental quality for occupants particularly through increased fresh air, daylight, glare control, access to views, and noise management. The positive results reinforce the value of an integrated and user-responsive approach that was adopted for building design, development, and management. The reduction in operational energy (in this project, coupled with carbon reduction) as a consequence of refurbishment and positive user feedback demonstrates the potential to future-proof existing buildings in the context of climate change. Les batiments existants offrent la meilleure possibilite de reduction des emissions de gaz a effet de serre dans les economies developpees, etant donne que les constructions neuves ne representent chaque annee que 2 a 3% du parc bati. Les enseignements retires d'une evaluation apres occupation d'une operation de renovation a grande echelle realisee dans l'immeuble d'un siege social de Sydney, en Australie, sont presentes afin d'inflechir les futures strategies en matiere de renovation. L'etude evalue la satisfaction des occupants et les performances energetiques, et met au jour les facteurs d'influence qui decoulent du processus de conception et des interventions realisees, de la gestion en cours du batiment et des performances de fonctionnement. Les occupants ont exprime un degre de satisfaction eleve sur l'ensemble des variables environnementales concernant le confort global, la temperature, l'eclairage et la qualite de l'air, aussi bien que la productivite et la sante telles qu'ils les ont percues. Ces resultats mettent en evidence le fait qu'il est important d'ameliorer la qualite environnementale interieure pour les occupants, tout particulierement en apportant davantage d'air frais et de lumiere du jour, un plus grand controle de l'eblouissement, un acces accru a des panoramas et une gestion renforcee du bruit. Ces resultats positifs renforcent l'utilite d'une approche integree et sensible aux besoins des utilisateurs, telle qu'elle a ete adoptee pour concevoir, amenager et gerer ce batiment. La reduction de l'energie de fonctionnement (dans cette operation, conjointement avec la reduction du carbone) en consequence de la renovation et du feedback positif des utilisateurs demontre le potentiel de cette approche pour permettre aux batiments existants de bien affronter l'avenir dans le contexte du changement climatique.

AB  - The housing environment is of utmost importance as people spend most of their time indoors; it is closely related to the occupant's quality of life (QOL) and health, especially among the elderly. This study evaluated the relationships among the architectural composition (AC), indoor environmental quality (IEQ), residential satisfaction (RS), and the QOL of those residing in housing for the elderly in Northeast China based on the results of a large-scale questionnaire and structural equation. The questionnaire was designed based on previous literature and included questions on the demographics, 11 items related to the AC, actual records, 19 measurable RS items, 6 measurable IEQ items, and 14 measurable aspects of QOL. The survey was conducted via face-to-face interviews, at 34 randomly selected homes for the elderly. In total, 1457 valid questionnaire responses were collected and checked using the reliability and validation tests. The results of the structural equation model indicated that the IEQ and RS have the greatest impact on the QOL, and act as intermediary variables, which indirectly affect the influence of the AC on the QOL. Therefore, the QOL of the elderly can be improved by enhancing the IEQ and RS. Overall, the results herein demonstrate that the structure equation model is valid, and the difference analysis indicates the differences in the evaluation results for buildings of different scales and structural characteristics. These results can make important contributions to the innovation of future housing for the elderly that can meet their needs and improve their QOL.

AB  - Anthropogenic heat (AH) emission from buildings is a key contributor to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Although an improved understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of building AH is highly needed for mitigating UHI effect, such information is still limited in high spatiotemporal resolutions at the city level. In this study, a bottom-up city building heat emission model (CityBHEM) was developed to investigate temporal variations of building AH from three components (i.e., envelope convection, zone infiltration and exfiltration, and HVAC system) for all buildings in Boston, United States. First, buildings in Boston were grouped into eleven commercial and five residential building prototypes based on building type, construction year, and foundation type. Second, an end-use-based calibration was developed to calibrate CityBHEM using U.S. Energy Information Administration's survey data. Finally, AH from all buildings in the city under actual weather conditions was calculated using the calibrated CityBHEM model together with building types and sizes. Results indicate that total building AH density of Back Bay neighborhood reaches the maximum value of 526 kWh/m(2) in summer (56% of HVAC system and 44% of envelope convection) and the minimum value of 369 kWh/m(2) in winter (54% of HVAC system, 24% of envelope convection and 22% of zone infiltration and exfiltration). In contrast, total building AH density of suburban neighborhoods is lower than 30 kWh/m(2) in summer and 20 kWh/m(2) in winter. Given that key inputs are publicly available, CityBHEM is transferable to other U.S. cities, enabling us to explore practical building energy-saving strategies for mitigating AH.

AB  - Land prices are at the heart of urban economics but are generally not observed directly. Though they are central to household and firm location choices, land-only sales in urban areas are rare and often outliers. Indeed, urban areas are in part defined by a largely contiguous area of high land-use intensity - those places in which devel-opable land is scarce. In this paper, we make use of more-common market data to infer land prices: house sales. Using locally weighted regressions, we estimate the value of a standardized structure across two urban counties: Maricopa, Arizona and Sedgwick, Kansas. Because the value of the standardized structure should be invariant across different locations in a metropolitan area, any remaining variation in the value surface should reflect differences in land values. By pinning down this surface using vacant lot sales at the periphery, we are able to extract land values throughout the metropolitan area, even in locations where vacant land sales are rare.

AB  - Housing-policy research in European Union countries distinguishes between two kinds of rent control: non-targeted first-generation" rent control and targeted second-generation" rent control, the later which better reflects housing market relations. The article demonstrates the drastic consequences of first-generation rent control in the Czech Republic, using criteria of social effectiveness and economic efficiency. The authors present the results of an econometric simulation model on the determination of equilibrium market rents after rent deregulation. Due to a sharp decrease in housing affordability in the Czech Republic, the authors simulate the application of two housing-policy instruments: social housing and housing allowance. A cost-benefit analysis shows that rent deregulation and the application of effective policy instruments would substantially increase the income of landlords, decrease the level of currently biased market rents, and maintain the relative affordability of housing.

AB  - Using recycled rubber crumbs as drainage layer in extensive green roofs have high potential to reduce the heating and cooling loads in buildings over traditional materials used as drainage layer, such as pozzolana gravel. However, the environmental impact due to the life cycle should be analyzed to assess its environmental benefit. This paper evaluates the environmental performance of green roofs in which the drainage layer is made of rubber crumbs, a recycled material the use of which is still experimental for this purpose. In this paper Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is applied to compare the environmental impact of four constructive systems, two extensive green roofs without insulation layer and with different drainage materials, a recycled material, rubber crumbs, and a conventional one, pozzolana gravel -, in front of two conventional flat roofs, with and without thermal insulation (polyurethane), built in an experimental set-up consisting of four monitored house-like cubicles, located in Mediterranean continental climate (Lleida, Spain). The LCA considered the production, construction, operational, and disposal phases of the roofs, according to UNE-EN 15643-2. The operational phase was carried out using data measured in the experimental set-up, considering heating and cooling energy consumptions in the winter and summer period, respectively.

AB  - Green buildings are designed to have low environmental impacts and improved occupant health and well-being. Improvements to the built environment including ventilation, lighting, and materials have resulted in improved indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in green buildings, but the evidence around occupant health is currently centered around environmental perceptions and self-reported health. To investigate the objective impact of green buildings on health, we tracked IEQ self-reported health, and heart rate in 30 participants from green and conventional buildings for two weeks. 24 participants were then selected to be relocated to the Syracuse Center of Excellence, a LEED platinum building, for six workdays. While they were there, ventilation, CO2, and volatile organic compound (VOC) levels were changed on different days to match the IEQ of conventional, green, and green+ (green with increased ventilation) buildings. Participants reported improved air quality, odors, thermal comfort, ergonomics, noise and lighting and fewer health symptoms in green buildings prior to relocation. After relocation, participants consistently reported fewer symptoms during the green building conditions compared to the conventional one, yet symptom counts were more closely associated with environmental perceptions than with measured IEQ. On average, participants had 4.7 times the odds of reporting a lack of air movement, 43% more symptoms (p-value = 0.019) and a 2 bpm higher heart rate (p-value < 0.001) for a 1000 ppm increase in indoor CO2 concentration. These findings suggest that occupant health in green and conventional buildings is driven by both environmental perceptions and physiological pathways. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Life-Cycle Assessments (LCA) have become a common tool of decision support in the built environment regarding environmental impacts. The goal of this study is to investigate the influence of different LCA approaches and system boundaries on decision support regarding circular design strategies. Three different ways of applying attributional LCA (ALCA) and one consequential LCA (CLCA) are assessed using a case study of a wooden beam with either virgin or reclaimed timber. While the conclusions are not readily scalable, the case study's results indicate that using reclaimed material is environmentally beneficial when applying ALCA. However, when applying CLCA the reclaimed material performs worse than the virgin material. This highlights the potential pitfalls of scaling up solutions based on LCA results without considering the broader consequences. While the current ALCA approach is useful for declarations, it may not provide comprehensive decision support for driving a transition in the built environment.

AB  - The paper deals with the dichotomy between the horizontal and vertical development of the built environment in urban contexts while taking into consideration different densities and settlement logics by following the specific approach of environmental and technological design. The research focuses on two well-known environmental parameters, wind and sun, identifying specific performance indicators related to natural ventilation (pressure coefficient and wind speed profile) and envelope-related energy needs (percentage of openings, shape and orientation of a spatial unit). For each indicator, a sensitivity analysis was carried out taking into consideration density and building height variations to evaluate the design choices from early-design phases.

AB  - Social Housing (SH) in Mexico has a potentially important role in reducing both the emission of greenhouse gases and the use of non-renewable resources, two of the main challenges facing not only Mexico but the planet as a whole. This work assesses the environmental impact generated by the embodied stages of a typical SH throughout its life cycle (cradle to grave), by means of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Two types of envelope and interior walls and three types of windows are compared. It was found that SH emits 309 kg CO2 eq/m(2) and consumes 3911 MJ eq/m(2) in the product stages (A1 to A3) and construction process (A4 to A5); the most important stages are those referring to the products, namely, A1 to A3, B4 (replacement) and B2 (maintenance). Additionally, benefits were found in the use of lightweight and thermal materials, such as concrete blocks lightened with pumice or windows made of PVC or wood. Although the use of LCA is incipient in the housing and construction sector in Mexico, this work shows how its application is not only feasible but recommended as it may become a basic tool in the search for sustainability.

AB  - The building sector accounts for over one-third of global energy consumption and a significant share of carbon emissions. Improving building energy efficiency, particularly in the tropics, where most of the future development is foreseen, is thus crucial. One of the main factors that determine building energy performance is the building envelope. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the impact of several envelope design variables, such as thermal, optical, physical, and geometrical, on the energy performance of buildings in the tropics. A correlational analysis that elaborates on the effectiveness of each of these measures is discussed in detail. The findings indicate that insulation, glazing properties, and Window-to-wall ratio (WWR) are promising solutions for improving energy efficiency in tropical buildings. Among these, insulating the building envelope has the most significant impact on energy savings. The variables of building orientation and the thermal mass of building materials have the least influence on total energy consumption. The latter exhibits complex effects in regions characterized by hot-humid climates. An optimized design in cooling-dominated climates should have a large aspect ratio, a higher WWR in the north and south facades, and an ideal shading system. With all variables combined and appropriate ventilation, a building can save 35% of annual energy and up to 60% in some cases. This study further reveals that available research on the effect of building shape and the context of surrounding built environment on energy consumption remains limited.

We trace the evolution of US housing policy toward greater hybridity, focusing on three dimensions of hybridity. Drawing from a case study of the Charlotte Housing Authority in North Carolina, we showcase two housing programs, HOPE VI and Moving to Work, in order to highlight current innovations in the provision of housing for low-income populations and the entrenched hybridity that is evident. Using this information, we address two main questions: (1) how do local public housing agencies collaborate with the Federal government, private developers, and non-profit service providers to fund, construct, and manage affordable rental housing? and (2) what are the benefits and challenges of hybrid models of affordable rental housing delivery within the US context?

AB  - The high energy prices in Europe have caused an increase in energy poverty, even in Norway, where electricity has traditionally been affordable due to cheap hydropower. In this paper, we analyse the impact of energyefficiency policies on low-income households to discover whether they reduce or reinforce existing injustices. To address this, our approach combines energy justice with a theory of care. Little attention has been paid to care within the context of energy, although it has been widely used to understand how and why we carry out everyday practices. The paper is based on a qualitative interview study with low-income households from three Norwegian cities. Participants were asked about their concerns and challenges regarding the housing and energy sectors as well as the potential solutions they imagined. We found that policy that is intended to encourage household investments in energy-efficient solutions is amplifying experiences of social inequality among low-income households. Moreover, the lack of connections between energy-efficiency policies and social-housing policy often results in unaddressed housing injustices. Furthermore, we discovered that caring practices played a dual role when addressing energy-related issues. On the one hand, practicing care was crucial in helping low-income households develop appropriate solutions to their everyday challenges. On the other hand, by resolving their immediate concerns through practicing care, they inadvertently concealed energy injustices from wider society. Based on this, we argue that caring energy efficiency practices should be made visible and acknowledged in energy policy discourses. We see this as crucial to enable a just energy transition.

Sustainable design intentions and pragmatic constraints are discussed in addition to the energy considerations for each design element. The GROW home includes features designed to support a unique lifestyle, including an integrated greenhouse (the "GRoWlarium") and various operable systems under the occupant's control. Whole-building energy simulations, spreadsheet calculations, daylighting simulations, and proprietary sizing software were used in design decision making. Energy performance predictions and measured results from the 2015 competition are discussed. The home was predicted to consume 177.11 kWh, and produce 238 kWh during the competition; it actually consumed 161 kWh, and produced 191 kWh, an error of 3% and 8%, respectively. The GROW home ultimately had the lowest energy consumption of any SD 2015 house which successfully performed all competition-required tasks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Economic development and rising welfare lead to higher demand for energy services, which can limit or even negate the results of costly energy efficiency (EE) upgrades. At present, some consumption patterns in Central and Eastern European countries are more sustainable compared to the European Union (EU) average but are rapidly approaching it. Energy sufficiency (ES) leading to an absolute reduction in energy demand will be essential for achieving net zero climate goals, as it will contribute to reducing energy use and the significant investment needs associated with the electrification of the energy system. Various regulatory solutions can be deployed in pursuit of ES targets, but little information is available on the possible impacts on energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially at the national level. This paper focuses on the residential building sector of two Central and Eastern European countries: Lithuania and Hungary. It attempts to quantify the potential energy demand reduction, associated GHG savings and the resulting change in the energy mix from limiting the per capita heated floor area using scenario analysis with the MESSAGE and HU-TIMES energy system models. The findings suggest that final energy demand could be reduced by 3.6% in Lithuania and 0.9% in Hungary. This would lead to a change in the energy production mix resulting in lower GHG emissions and savings on new energy generation capacity. The results of the research are indicative, as no costs were assigned to ES measures and the calculations were based on assumed levels of ES indicators. However, they suggest that it is worth identifying the consumption segments with ES potential, as a combination of the relevant measures can largely contribute to the achievement of net zero emissions.

In this regard, reducing energy consumption and using renewable energies are the main approaches of this paper. Thus, firstly, the most applicable renewable energy system in building industry has been identified; then, the design and construction measures have been identified and evaluated with respect to their effects on the building energy-performance; utilization of renewable energy systems as well as energy consumption patterns. In this way, utilization of renewable energy has been evaluated on the basis of experts' opinion and energy consumption has been evaluated on the basis of energy simulation. The primary result of this research revealed that, passive solar energy is the most applicable renewable energy system in urban areas and buildings in Iran. Furthermore, 23 design and construction measures were identified and categorized into 12 groups. Finally, the groups of measures are evaluated and classified into three levels of high, medium, and low importance with respect to their effects on buildings energy-performance.

AB  - We investigate whether mandatory energy performance certificates of existing residential properties contribute to property price premiums after the implementation of the EU directive on the energy performance of buildings in the Swedish private housing market. Analysing mandatory energy performance certificates of the 2009-2010 private housing transactions, we find that energy performance is associated with transaction price in situations when it is conditional on a reference benchmark. We also document property price premiums for energy performance within housing segments built before 1960 and those with a lower transaction price per square metre. Our results suggest that the property market values energy performance, and we make recommendations on which housing segments need policy support to encourage energy improvements.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the relationships between sustainable building design and occupant well-being. It starts with a definition of sustainable design and well-being, and focuses on the relationships between energy performance and occupant feedback. Methodologically it draws on detailed monitoring and surveys of 12 case study office buildings in the UK and India, and the paper uses the data to explore whether energy use and associated CO2 emissions are correlated to occupant satisfaction and comfort. The results demonstrate that increased energy use in the case study buildings is associated with increased mechanisation (e.g. centralised air conditioning) and reduced occupant control. This reduced control in turn is shown to relate to reduced occupant comfort and satisfaction. Finally, the paper reveals that the reported health conditions of occupants correlates strongly with their levels of satisfaction. The overall conclusion is that energy use in typical office buildings is inversely correlated with the well-being of the occupants: more energy use does not improve well-being. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigates the energy efficiency of dome-shaped structures in traditional Iranian architecture in regions with cold winters and hot summers against the backdrop of rising energy consumption and environmental concerns. The present study employed Design Builder software to simulate three discrete models of Nowzari Caravanserai, featuring dome, flat, and sloping roofs. It was compared to the original model's dome-shaped roof in terms of energy consumption and internal temperature. The objective was to investigate the potential differences in thermal energy consumption across these distinct roof designs in all months of the year. The results indicate that the dome-shaped structures exhibit better efficacy in controlling indoor temperatures, as demonstrated by a marked increase in indoor temperatures during colder months and a decrease in indoor temperatures during hotter months, relative to alternative structures. Moreover, the results of the simulation of two domed-roof models with ventilation and without ventilation showed that in this climate zone, the ventilation holes built into the roof have a unique efficiency in adjusting the internal temperature. The implications of this research include that traditional architectural features such as domed structures can be incorporated into contemporary construction practices to foster energy-efficient buildings and sustainable urbanization. This holds true not only for hot and desert climate regions but also for areas characterized by both hot summers and cold winters. The integration of traditional expertise and modern technology can help create buildings that balance aesthetics and sustainability, creating a cleaner, more sustainable built environment.

AB  - Energy and exergy analyses are presented for the air cooling of the dew air supply in buildings, which is applied to a commercial store with a floor area of 2000m(2) as an example of application in four Chinese cities. A new method is described in this article for selecting indoor temperature and relative humidity to achieve minimum energy and exergy consumption for a required indoor thermal comfort level which is evaluated with indoor effective temperature. The results show that humans are more sensitive to variations in temperature than those of relative humidity, and the influence of indoor relative humidity on exergy consumption is far greater than that of energy consumption, and far greater than that of indoor temperature. Hence energy consumption and exergy consumption in an air-conditioning building may be reduced by choosing larger relative humidity.

AB  - The application of retrofit actions to existing building stocks can improve the energy performance of the residential sector. In this context, particular attention should be given to historical buildings, which represent a large part of the Italian building stock. To improve the energy performance of them, adequate retrofit actions must be applied. Many studies and regulations have focused on identifying the best refurbishment measures. However, the selection of these measures is difficult due to restrictive regulations, which are dictated by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, high retrofit costs, and variable climate zones. Thus, energy renovations in Italian buildings are not simple, and it is very difficult to find generic solutions that can be applied to buildings across the entire territory. In this paper, the authors investigated the most common retrofit solutions used in Italy, focusing in particular on the energy performance of historical building envelopes. First, energy performance analyses were conducted for two typical base cases in four different Italian cities using TRNSYS software, and some common retrofit measures were analysed. In some cases, the results showed Primary Energy saving of 44.6% (sample A) and 56.7% (sample B). Furthermore, these were used to identify different energy and economic impacts associated with the same refurbishment measures in different climatic contexts, highlighting the non-existence of a generic solution suitable for all regions or countries.

AB  - This paper presents a Bayesian approach for developing city-scale energy models of the built environment and demonstrates its application to non-domestic buildings in Greater London. The work draws upon available information of the building stock, such as: mapping databases, floorspace statistics, energy benchmarks, and measured energy consumption reported in display energy certificates of public buildings. The resulting model is able to describe the spread due to variation of energy consumption across buildings within a similar category. These spreads (or distributions) can be used for estimating the probability distribution of the gross energy consumption per local authority in Greater London. The work is driven by the need to quantify future energy demand of buildings in their urban context as a function of projected growth of buildings and populations, refurbishments, policies incentivizing energy efficiency measures, and changes in building operation. The focus on the non-domestic sector enables a framework that accommodates diverse set of activities and uses of buildings within an urban region. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - What makes a design beautiful? Design styles developed during past eras such as byzantine, classical, gothic, renaissance and baroque are universally admired as being cultural icons and are widely appreciated by people from all walks of life. Throughout the years, many philosophers, architects and physicists have come up with theories and frameworks to measure the subjective topic of aesthetics, but none stood out like Birkhoff's aesthetic measure which used a mathematical approach to quantifying beauty. In this paper, we investigate the aesthetic appeal of generative AI model outputs, trained on datasets recognized for their aesthetic quality, and by employing biometric data analysis to cross-reference these results with Birkhoff's aesthetic measurement framework. Stemming from Neuroarchitecture, wearable technologies offer an insight into the correlation between spatial qualities and human perception that can be extended into aiding us, architects in designing better for the built environment. In our experiment, we generated a set of interior images in assorted styles following current interior design trends. The generated outputs are first scored based on Birkhoff's measurements of aesthetics and cross referenced with data obtained from wearable technologies such as an eye tracker and electroencephalogram (EEG) headset. Eye tracking glasses can detect fixations, saccade patterns, and pupil dilation, which can reflect subconscious thoughts from the user. The EEG is also utilised to complement the eye tracking data as a means to reflect on positive or negative impressions towards a particular subject. Overall, this innovative approach adapts Birkhoff's aesthetic measurement in a human-centric and evidence-based way, providing architects with a framework to systematically evaluate design. It merges Birkhoff's theorem with unbiased subconscious metrics to compare current and historical aesthetic trends, and behavioural research to pinpoint common aesthetic preferences. This method also leverages biometric data to align architectural design more closely with user perspectives, breaking down traditional communication barriers and offering clearer insights into client preferences.

AB  - Embodied emissions in construction materials make a relevant contribution to carbon emissions worldwide. While this has been broadly recognised, only little attention has been paid to the role of load-bearing structures in this regard, and if so, mainly limited to assessments of individual structures. For analysing the global warming impact of engineering structures in a wider context, dynamic material flow analysis is deployed in this study. The future stocks and flows of structural materials and their associated embodied emissions in German residential buildings are quantified based on a mass-balance consistent multi-layer model, which relates the stocks in use, their inputs, outputs and determinants, such as the building lifetime, the population or the useful building floor area per capita. A scenario analysis under combination of different emission mitigation measures is performed, among them a gradual replacement of the comparatively large masonry structure stock share by timber structures, and a general downsizing of structural material quantities. The results show that when applied to a realistic extent, such measures could contribute with about 4% to 8% to the German average target mitigation rate required for achieving emission neutrality in 2045.

AB  - In the built environment, one of the main concerns during the design stage is the selection of adequate structural materials and elements. A rational and sensible design of both materials and elements results not only in economic benefits and computing time reduction, but also in minimizing the environmental impact. Nowadays, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are showing their potential as design tools. In this research, ANNs are used in order to foster the implementation of efficient tools to be used during the early stages of structural design. The proposed networks are applied to a dry precast concrete connection, which has been modelled by means of the Finite Element Method (FEM). The parameters are: strength of concrete and screws, diameter of screws, plate thickness, and the posttensioning load. The ANN input data are the parameters and nodal stresses obtained from the FEM models. A multilayer perceptron combined with a backpropagation algorithm is used in the ANN architecture, and a hyperbolic tangent function is applied as an activation function. Comparing the obtained predicted stresses to those of the FEM analyses, the difference is less than 9.16%. Those results validate their use as an efficient structural design tool. The main advantage of the proposed ANNs is that they can be easily and effectively adapted to different connection parameters. In addition, their use could be applied both in precast or cast in situ concrete connection design.

AB  - Rail transit is becoming significant to urban growth and sustainability in China since China is investing more than 2 trillion yuan in urban rail transit during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). Transit-oriented development (TOD) emphasizes using built-environment factors such as mixed-use, density, and walkability, to maximize the benefits of improving transit accessibility. Although studies illustrate how transit-oriented builtenvironments amplify the rail transit impact on housing prices within the American context, little attention has been paid to Chinese cities. Using a case study of Wuhan City in China, this study shows that a higher transit proximity premium of housing prices is more likely to occur in the place with more mixed land uses. Policy implications on TOD planning and land value capture near transit station areas are derived.

AB  - Consumer behavior is one of the most Important issues with respect to household energy consumption. This paper will evaluate the energy-saving potential of improving consumer behavior on the basis of a field study. In the original survey plan, the monthly electricity use of households in three typical residential buildings In the city of Hangzhou, China, were monitored from April 2007 to July 2008. A total of 124 households in those buildings were selected as the subject households. Half of them were informed of 34 energy-saving measures before July 2008 to teach them how to improve their behavior and control electric appliances in their daily lives. Finally, a questionnaire survey was administered in the beginning of August 2008 to identify the changes in the occupants' behavior. Based on the comparison analyses among the differences in the electricity uses of the 71 remaining valid samples, the conclusions can be drawn that: (1) residential electricity use will increase continually in the near future in China due to improved standards of living and a greater dependency on electric appliances, and (2) more than 10% of household electricity use can be conserved by Informing occupants of energy-saving measures to improve their behavior.

AB  - Recent work on the aesthetics of the built and natural environment has shown that aesthetic responses are derived from three interrelated psychological dimensions: Fascination (an environment's richness or interest), Coherence (analytic judgments about an environment's organization and construction), and Hominess (feelings of warmth or coziness). However, it is also well-established that individuals differ widely in their responses to environments and objects. In particular, training in the arts has been reliably shown to influence people's aesthetic experiences. Here, we investigated the extent to which expertise in architecture and design influenced responses and preferences to the natural and built environment. Across three studies, we found that the underlying psychological dimensions of Experts and Novices are qualitatively different. We further hypothesized that expertise in architecture renders design features of the environment to be more emotionally and aesthetically pleasing. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Coherence dimension of architecture Experts was more strongly associated with Fascination and Hominess criteria, and had a greater influence on their overall aesthetic experience. Additionally, our findings provide evidence of expertise effects for both rapid and deliberate judgements. In sum, the present study extends a growing body of research on the underlying psychological dimensions of aesthetic experiences of the environment, demonstrating that expertise affects the interrelatedness of these dimensions.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the effects of COVID-19 stress on healing behavior in residential spaces. Based on the results, the study further examines the residential space as a healing environment according to space use behavior in the post-COVID era. A survey including 2101 Korean people was conducted. The COVID Stress Scale for Korean People (CSSK) was used to identify COVID-19 stress. In addition, using a literature review on healing environment factors and behavioral changes after the pandemic, survey questions were developed to assess changes in healing behavior. A frequency analysis was conducted for sociodemographic factors, and the relationship between COVID stress factors and healing behavior factors in residential spaces was examined using factor and correlation analyses. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to verify the effects of COVID stress factors on changes in healing behavior. The results revealed that COVID stress affected healing behavior in residential spaces; however, there were differences in healing behavior depending on the COVID stress factors. Fear of being infected positively affected infection prevention behavior in homes. Anger towards others negatively affected the establishment of elements that support various activities in the residential spaces and furniture arrangement. Stress from social distancing difficulties affected healing behavior in residential spaces but was not related to infection prevention behavior. Residential spaces can serve as healing spaces when people are provided with various spatial factors that support diverse types of behavior during a pandemic crisis.

AB  - Educational accommodations are frequently given to students with disabilities. For instance, students might be given a copy of class notes or provided additional time to complete a test. One purpose of accommodations is to improve educational equity, putting all students on equal footing. However, research on current accommodations practices raises two distinct equity-related concerns. First, students from privileged backgrounds are more likely to receive certain accommodations even without adequate evidence of need; this can provide an unfair boost in performance and widen gaps among students. Second, when students from less privileged backgrounds are given accommodations, the incentive for schools to provide academic remediation, compensatory strategies, and coping skills is lessened, leaving these students in a worse position when accommodations are not available outside of educational settings. Implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - Tourism, which is defined as the exchange of culture in its general aspect, is categorised based on its intended purposes. Ecotourism has been introduced and become worldwide popular in the last quarter century with familiarising and experiencing local cultures through travels to the naturally and ecologically unspoilt parts of countries. Accommodation buildings that are significant elements of tourism activities are vital in ecotourism practices and sustainability due to the provision of cultural exchange for their visitors. Cyprus is an important tourism centre with its significant location in the world, cultural heritage with rich historical background and advantages from the Mediterranean climate. With the advantage of being an island, Cyprus still maintains the traditional living culture and ecological spaces, both of which create a huge demand for ecotourism. The residential buildings constructed and restored with traditional architectural characteristics are used as accommodation buildings at the ecotourism villages of North Cyprus. With architectural characteristics, authentic features and their service approach with local products, such buildings have vital role in sustainable ecotourism through introduction and promotion of traditional cultural richness to their visitors. Our research explains the definitions of tourism and ecotourism and their types by presenting our research on the tourism and ecotourism activities in North Cyprus. Then as the main dimension of our study, the accommodation buildings with traditional architectural characteristics were selected from the North Cyprus ecotourism villages as examples, and their common architectural characteristics were presented which were identified through a detailed field study. The findings and assessment on the architectural details about lodging structures were concluded the role and significance of lodging structures for ecotourism.

AB  - Mannerism was the bridge between late Renaissance and the Baroque between 1520 and the 1600s. This movement was characterized by the destabilization of compositional elements through repetition and expressiveness, regardless of their function. This phase in history echoes a trend in contemporary architecture based on the repetition of functionless elements that constitute a 'green aesthetic' in detriment of sustainable systems. Ecomannerism is a conceptual vehicle to identify and evaluate iconic contemporary projects that are positioned between ecologies of practice and ecologies of symbols, which are directly related to the sustainable performance of the built environment.

AB  - The high energy consumption of modern high-rise residential buildings is leading to global warming. In the context of globalisation, western copy high-rise apartments are out of touch with the local climate, resulting in an ecological adaptation crisis. Low thermal comfort and bad experience have seriously affected people's quality of life and physical and mental health. The purpose is to promote the ecological adaptability strategy of high-rise buildings so that they can interact with the surrounding environment. This study examined the ecological adaptation of high-rise residential buildings using a systematic literature review. Using field study and a questionnaire survey, the study collected data on factors affecting the adaptability of high-rise residential buildings to predict and manage the climate and to offer a theoretical foundation for regulating the ecological adaptability of buildings. The study shows that contextualised building design can attain climatic adaptability. to create ecologically adaptable housing based on macro, middle, and microclimates to support the harmonious co-habitation of the environment, architecture, and people.

AB  - How can metropolitan regions ramp up housing production to meet the demands of a growing population, after years of inadequate construction and mounting challenges for affordability? I consider recent policy reforms in the Paris region that have successfully doubled that area's housing-unit completion rate. I show that a focus on social housing, harnessing of publicly owned land, new financial and regulatory incentives, and the enforcement of municipal policy by higher level governments have effectively encouraged development. These policies complemented one another and were implemented by multiple levels of government as part of a shared metropolitan strategy. Paris' example offers a model for other regions looking to identify appropriate policies to spur construction.

AB  - For 3 decades, U.S. federal housing policies have sought to increase access to socially diverse and high opportunity neighborhoods and improve the quality of life for low-income families. Absent from current discussions of the costs and benefits of socially mixed communities is the potential value that they may have to low-income families seeking to purchase their own homes. In this paper, we examine the extent to which participation in homebuyer education and counseling programs supports sustainable low-income homeownership in socially mixed neighborhoods. Using quasi-experimental methodologies and longitudinal data from the Denver Housing Study for a sample of 533 low-income homebuyers, this study examines whether, compared with a comparison group of public housing residents who purchased homes on their own, participants in Denver Housing Authority's (DHA) homebuyer education and counseling program (HOP) were (1) more likely to purchase homes in socially mixed destination neighborhoods; and (2) sustain homeownership over time. Results show that low-income homebuyers purchased homes in destination neighborhoods characterized by considerable ethnic and income mix. When compared to non-HOP homebuyers, HOP homebuyers also were better off in terms of 2018 home value appreciation and fewer foreclosures, suggesting that homebuyer education and counseling improves long-term sustainability of homeownership.

AB  - Protected lands provide high ecological and social value, yet a perception that land protection erodes local property tax bases and shifts tax burdens to other owners creates barriers for new protection. We investigate the impact of land protection on local property tax rates using panel data from more than 1400 towns and cities in New England between 1990 and 2015, including both ownership and easement-based protection. We find that on average, new protection results in a small increase in annual tax rates, with an expected change of $0.0231 per $1000 of value for a 1 percentage point increase in the percent of municipal area protected. This corresponds to an increase in a homeowner's annual property tax bill of $1.16 per $100,000 of value for 100 acres of new land protection. We do not find that taxes continue to increase over time or reduce municipal expenditures. However, for towns that are growing slowly, have lower household in-comes, or use municipal land protection, we estimate greater tax bill increases of up to $10 for each $100,000 of value. These results provide evidence that land protection does not have a substantial impact on property taxes, but also highlight the importance of maintaining and expanding public compensation mechanisms, such as payments in lieu of taxes, where expected burdens from new protection may be greater.

AB  - Many studies have explored the relationship between housing prices and environmental characteristics using the hedonic price model (HPM). However, few studies have deeply examined the impact of scene perception near residential units on housing prices. This article used house purchasing records from FANacom and open access geolocation data (including massive street view pictures, point of interest (POI) data and road network data) and proposed a framework named "open-access-dataset-based hedonic price modeling (OADB-HPM)" for comprehensive analysis in Beijing and Shanghai, China. A state-of-the-art deep learning framework and massive Baidu street view panoramas were employed to visualize and quantify three major scene perception characteristics (greenery, sky and building view indexes, abbreviated GVI, SVI and BVI, respectively) at the street level. Then, the newly introduced scene perception characteristics were combined with other traditional characteristics in the HPM to calculate marginal prices, and the results for Beijing and Shanghai were explored and compared. The empirical results showed that the greenery and sky perceptual elements at the property level can significantly increase the housing price in Beijing (RMB 39,377 and 6011, respectively) and Shanghai (RMB 21,689 and 2763, respectively), indicating an objectively higher willingness by buyers to pay for houses that provide the ability to perceive natural elements in the surrounding environment. This study developed quantification tools to help decision makers and planners understand and analyze the interaction between residents and urban scene components.

AB  - Previous research has indicated that mode-specific attitudes can affect travel mode choice through the residential location choice. According to the principle of residential self-selection, people will try to choose a residential neighbourhood that enables them to travel with as high a share as possible of their amount of travel with their preferred mode. In this study, however, we will analyse whether differences in travel distance, travel time and travel satisfaction in urban versus suburban neighbourhoods are due to travel-liking attitudes, the residential location or a combination of both. Results of this study - analysing leisure trips within the city of Ghent (Belgium) - indicate that suburban respondents are, compared to urban respondents, more satisfied with their trips, which are also longer in time and distance. Suburban respondents also have a more positive stance towards travelling, suggesting a possible residential self-selection process. Travel lovers might prefer a residential neighbourhood where travel distances and travel time are relatively high, while people who do not like to travel might prefer to live in a neighbourhood that enables more short-distance and less travel-time intensive trips. This study suggests that especially people who do not like to travel self-select themselves in urban neighbourhoods in order to limit travel distance and travel time. In contrast, respondents with a more positive stance towards travelling are equally distributed in urban and suburban neighbourhoods. Results also indicate that travel distance and travel time are mainly affected by respondents' residential neighbourhood, while travel satisfaction is mainly affected by travel-liking attitudes.

AB  - Despite increased access, students with disabilities in higher education face barriers and report greater dissatisfaction than peers without disabilities [Mullins and Preyde 2013; Strnadova, Hajkova, and Kvetonova 2015]. Many U.S. institutions require students to present faculty with documentation prior to receiving academic accommodations; qualitative research indicates that this process of disclosing and requesting accommodations is uncomfortable. The current study sought to identify specific areas of discomfort associated with the accommodation request process and to identify individual differences related to apparentness of condition. One-hundred and fifty-five students from 2 universities responded to a survey addressing disclosing, requesting and using accommodations. Survey results indicated that participants lacked opportunities to privately disclose to faculty and revealed a significant relationship between lack of private disclosure opportunities and increased discomfort. Participants also reported discomfort and disrespectful treatment when disclosing to peers, echoing previous research and underscoring the need for private disclosure opportunities. Students with mental health related nonapparent disabilities reported significantly higher discomfort when disclosing and more negative peer interactions than students with apparent conditions or nonapparent learning difficulties. Findings highlight barriers present in systems that require students to present accommodation documentation and emphasise the role of peers in fostering inclusive environments.

AB  - The built environment contributes significantly to the rapidly growing world energy expenditure. Due to urbanization, buildings will continue to contribute to these escalating trends because of their tighter spatial interrelationships, and the influence of their surrounding micro-environment with respect to their orientations and designs. The concept of the Inter-Building Effect (IBE) was introduced to understand such complex mutual impact within spatially proximal buildings. As an extension and a more nuanced analysis of the IBE, our research sought to disaggregate and quantify the influence of mutual shading and mutual reflection within a network of buildings. A procedure to separately assess the complex interactions that make up the IBE was developed by comparative simulation and analysis in a dynamic simulation environment. We built an urban building network model and conducted cross-regional analysis under different climatological contexts by examining mutual shading only and mutual reflection only, respectively. We found the shading effect played a more significant role in terms of impact on energy consumption. This resulted in substantial variations for the control building's energy consumption when the shading effect was disaggregated from the IBE. The results of the simulations in varying climatological contexts also revealed consistent trends of greater impact on the IBE for shading and reflection in warmer climatic cities. These findings expand and deepen our understanding of the IBE and may help in the search to minimize mutual influences between buildings that lead to increases in energy consumption in urban environments.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present a method to calculate the morphological properties of the built environment using LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data, geographic information systems (GIS) data and three-dimensional (3D) models of cities as a source of information. A hybrid approach that takes into account different types of inputs and consequently evaluates the accuracy of each type of used data is presented. This work is intended to give a first response to the lack of a comprehensive and accurate procedure that uses LiDAR data in order to automatically derive precise morphological properties, such as volumes and surfaces (facades and roofs) of buildings. The method was tested on two case-study areas in the Geneva region with different characteristics, one in the old town along the Rhone River and the other on the CERN campus. A statistical analysis that compares the results of the computation with the 3D model of the built environment was used to validate the results, complemented by significance statistical tests. Outcomes showed that the proposed method to derive morphological properties can reach high levels of accuracy, thus enhancing the potential uses of LiDAR data for numerous applications, typically for the assessment of the urban environmental quality (UEQ) at the city and district scale, such as the estimation of the potential deployment of renewable energies in the built environment and the determination and monitoring of several urban indicators.

AB  - This paper explores the dynamic nature of the transformation of public housing regimes in urban China since the abolishment of the urban welfare housing system in the late 1990s. We summarize the latest progress in the development of public housing in post-reform China and investigate the driving forces behind these developments. A close examination of the public rental housing program in Shanghai helps to show that the recent revival of public housing in Chinese cities is mostly driven by the desire for economic growth. We conclude that the state provision of housing could be a short-run state remedy to alleviate economic imbalance and social inequality. However, in the long run China needs to seek more effective solutions to solve the low-income population's housing affordability problems.

AB  - The idea of sustainability is based on three pillars-environmental, economic, and social-per the Brundtland report. Housing is a type of architecture with which any occupant can connect. It is a place that supports an occupant's physical, emotional, cultural, and social needs, which support their consciousness. The methodology used here includes an extensive literature review, followed by data collection and analysis in order to understand, achieve, and balance sustainability and its metrics. We could see an evident gap in current green building rating systems regarding the inclusion of social and cultural indicators. There is an inclination for quantitative approaches, such as energy, the environment, and resources. We found that it is viable to identify, recognize, and determine social and cultural indicators that are both tangible and intangible. In most research regarding the sustainable built environment, the participation and feedback are limited to industry experts and professionals, and residents are excluded. This study attempted to fill this gap by collecting data from Indian residents, thus validating social and cultural indicators according to occupants' needs. With the help of indicators discovered in the literature review and by strengthening them further with data collection, a holistic framework was developed to achieve sustainability for housing.

AB  - A Remote Accessibility Assessment System (RAAS) that uses three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction technology is being developed; it enables clinicians to assess the wheelchair accessibility of users' built environments from a remote location. The RAAS uses commercial software to construct 3-D virtualized environments from photographs. We developed custom screening algorithms and instruments for analyzing accessibility. Characteristics of the camera and 3-D reconstruction software chosen for the system significantly affect its overall reliability. In this study, we performed an accuracy assessment to verify that commercial hardware and software can construct accurate 3-D models by analyzing the accuracy of dimensional measurements in a virtual environment and a comparison of dimensional measurements from 3-D models created with four cameras/settings. Based on these two analyses, we were able to specify a consumer-grade digital camera and PhotoModeler (EOS Systems, Inc, Vancouver, Canada) software for this system. Finally, we performed a feasibility analysis of the system in an actual environment to evaluate its ability to assess the accessibility of a wheelchair user's typical built environment. The field test resulted in an accurate accessibility assessment and thus validated our system.

AB  - An enormous range of building materials that is almost impossible to keep track of is available. The trend toward building densification in cities continues apace. Coupled with climate change, a situation is emerging that poses ecological as well as economic risks in terms of living comfort in public, urban spaces. Building designers need help (tools) to be able to address a wide range of requirements within their planning. The development of the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) model BASK (engl. "Construction Materials for Cities in Climate Change") is presented. The goal of the model is to assist building designers in determining surface materials for wall, ground and roof construction and help determine the best compromise between environmental, economic, and building practice criteria. Currently available criteria are heat stress, visual reflectance, CO2 equivalents, electricity production, retrofitability, sound absorption, construction costs, and life span. The criteria can be weighted by the designer, resulting in a customized ranking of construction systems that best meets the designer's prioritized criteria. The design of BASK basically allows for an extension of the criteria. The version of BASK described in this paper includes 10 construction systems covering a wide range of construction types focused on walls. The tool requires technical data for materials considered in construction systems included, which are made available via a data base. The scope of construction systems can also be extended in the future. Based on the restricted set of construction systems the results of a sensitivity analysis and initial validation are given.

AB  - In recent years, both the public concern on environmental issues and the interest and demand for sustainable buildings have been growing worldwide. Architects, engineers, building developers, and buildings owners are feeling pressure to design, construct, and maintain buildings that respect sustainability and the environment. In support of sustainable development initiatives of governments and the building industry, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) has established a Technical Committee on Sustainable Buildings, which has been tasked to develop national standards to advance the design, construction, and maintenance of buildings in a sustainable manner. This paper first discusses the standards development environment in Canada and the standards development process in CSA and goes on to describe the development of a new standard on the design for disassembly and adaptability of buildings.

AB  - Building energy modeling is pivotal in achieving sustainable energy goals throughout a building's design and operation. However, discrepancies often arise between actual energy consumption and predictions made by building energy models due to uncertainties in input parameters. This study addresses this challenge by calibrating building energy modeling with empirical data, focusing on apartment buildings in South Korea. Specifically, it targets public and lease apartments, which is crucial in attaining Zero Energy Building (ZEB) ratings. This study develops an apartment building model based on architectural design and energy use patterns, employing the whole building energy simulation tool, EnergyPlus. Key calibration elements were identified through systematic literature reviews, statistical analysis, architectural drawings, and monitoring data. The calibrated model achieved a prediction error of 2.7 % and a CV(RMSE) of 9.4 %, closely mirroring actual measurements. This was particularly influenced by using realistic occupancy schedules instead of generic ones. The results provide valuable insights for refining the residential building energy modeling process, especially in the context of ZEB goals. The study underscores the importance of accurate data collection and model calibration in bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-world energy consumption.

AB  - The transition toward a circular economy (CE) is key in decarbonizing the built environment. Despite this, knowledge of-and engagement with-CE philosophies remains limited within the construction industry. Discussion with practitioners reveals this to be contributed to by a lack of clarity regarding CE principles, with numerous organizations recommending implementation of differing and sometimes conflicting principles. In addition, a systematic assessment of how building designs consider CE is made difficult by the multiple design areas required to be considered and the large amount of design data required to do so. The absence of a systematic CE assessment causes a lack of comparability across designs, preventing benchmarking of CE practices in building design at present. This paper details the development of Regenerate, a CE engagement tool for the assessment of new and existing buildings, established in an effort to overcome the aforementioned barriers to the adoption of CE within the construction sector. A CE design workflow for the built environment is proposed, comprising four overarching circularity principles (Design for Adaptability; Design for Deconstructability; Circular Material Selection; Resource Efficiency) and contributing design actions. In addition to engaging stakeholders by enabling the assessment of building designs, the tool retrieves key data for further research. Information on completed design actions as well as recycling and waste metrics is collected to facilitate future CE benchmarking. "Bill of materials" data (i.e., material quantities) is also compiled, with this being key in material stock modeling research and embodied carbon benchmarking.

AB  - Inclusive design outcomes in architecture rely on valid and reliable information about user experiences. The way users perceive and experience the built environment contains the clues for the optimal facilitation of their needs and expectations. However, their perceptions of aspects of the built environment and their needs and expectations are not easily accessed for incorporation into the design work of professional architects and architecture students. This paper identifies how this need may be addressed and outlines methods of making such knowledge more accessible and in a form that facilitates ease of incorporation of user perceptions and expectations into design. Specifically, this paper details approaches whereby user perceptions are transformed into design tools that can be used by architects for applying inclusive design. Several approaches that are described in this paper can be applied and combined by architects and students to obtain information regarding user perception of the built environment and subsequently converting the information into the tools or criteria for designing inclusive buildings and facilities. The approaches and the tools are expected to support the incorporation of inclusive design into the architecture profession and education.

AB  - Purpose Physical inactivity has a considerable negative impact on health. Physical activity has reduced partly due to workplace and lifestyle changes, causing people to spend more time in buildings and increasing sedentary behaviour. The purpose of this paper is to address a largely untapped opportunity for designers and managers to improve building users' health by designing buildings that raise users' Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) levels. In this research a conceptual model was developed to assess buildings' performance in providing NEAT-promoting opportunities through building design features and management, in relation to building users' propensity for NEAT behaviours. Design/methodology/approach The conceptual model was developed by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers and data to populate the model was obtained through a survey of 75 buildings in Jakarta (Indonesia). Findings The presented proof-of-concept shows that the model's "meso-scale" approach to study physical activity and building design can lead to potential improvements of NEAT levels and physical activity in buildings. Originality/value The review of precedent models shows that this subject has been researched at micro-scale (i.e. detailed monitoring of individuals' movement) and macro-scale (i.e. epidemiological studies of populations' health). The presented model is original, as it explores a "meso-scale"(i.e. building scale) that is unique.

AB  - Background: The aim of this paper is to describe the development of a shared housing model intervention that was designed to serve youth experiencing homelessness who are LGBTQ+ and/or pregnant/parenting. The intervention is built around two guiding philosophies: housing first and restorative justice. Methods: We engaged in a year-long planning process with an advisory group from 1 July 2021 through 30 June 2022. The advisory group is a partnership between Virginia Commonwealth University School of Social Work, seven young people with lived experience expertise, and members from four partner organizations, including local organizations serving LGBTQ+ youth. Results: Marsha and Marian's Neighbors is designed to provide safe, comfortable housing for 12 months for 20 young people and their children if they have any. Participants will live in apartments where rent and utilities are paid for by the program for all participants. The program also provides money for arrears that may prevent the participants from being able to secure a lease, mental health appointments, legal consultations, and doula services provided by partners recruited by the planning team. Services are provided by staff and partners that are LGBTQ+ affirming and pregnant and parenting affirming. Conclusion: One of the most important lessons that we learned is the power of developing shared values in a novel intervention for LGBTQ+ youth. One focused intervention that supports both pregnant and parenting youth who identify as LGBTQ+ remains necessary. Paradoxically, LGBTQ+ people, particularly bisexual, lesbian, and queer cisgender women, are at an equal or greater risk of unplanned pregnancy. Both groups are vulnerable to housing instability independently, and those who live at the intersection of being LGBTQ+ and pregnant/parenting face an elevated risk for housing instability.

AB  - Daylighting is increasingly gaining awareness around the world among legislators, building owners and designers. It is considered an intrinsic part of green and sustainable building design. This momentum has induced designers and researchers to create novel and reliable daylighting technologies to reduce dependence on electric lighting and to save non-renewable energy sources. Therefore, many daylight devices have been created that are adaptable to all types of spaces and sky conditions. These devices vary from highly sophisticated technologies like holographic systems to simple windows with direct utilization of daylight. The increasing number of highly sophisticated daylight devices and the dependence of these devices on many building parameters make it hard for building designers to easily choose and utilize them. Therefore, this research presents a new matrix of daylight devices to help building designers correctly choose the most proper device in the right time during the building design process. The matrix helps identify the best daylighting devices for a specific project or space at any design stage. The selection of a device is based on specific designs and lighting requirements in addition to the problems faced by the designer. This research depends on analysing the working mechanisms of daylight devices, the design parameters that could affect a device performance in addition to design stages and process. The matrix matches daylighting devices with building design processes and stages to incorporate daylight as a fundamental design parameter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Regenerative development is a paradigm shift in the worldview from conventional sustainability toward rethinking the relationship between the built environment, people, and nature to cope with the consequences of climate change. This article's goal is to provide an assessment tool that will serve as a guide for applying regenerative development in the built environment. The study adopted mixed methods by combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies. It began with a systematic literature review, followed by a questionnaire and a comparative analysis to create the primary assessment tool. The study then localized the tool by using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to fit the Egyptian context. Finally, the American University Campus in Egypt was selected as a case study to evaluate the tool's validity. The results revealed that the developed tool is applicable and valid to the built environment. The paper covers the knowledge gap by translating the theoretical basis into a practical tool for creating a national rating system for regenerative development. The paper suggests further research to create quantitative indicators for achieving higher reliability.

AB  - This paper presents a vision for a sustainable and smart floating structure solution (S2FS2) in Hong Kong. It highlights the key features of S2FS2, particularly the adoption of a hybrid approach combining both floating structure solutions and conventional land reclamation for the creation of habitable land from the sea. The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities in deploying a hybrid floating development. These include: examining sustainable and cost-effective construction strategies and materials for floating platforms and superstructures in view of the highly corrosive environment in Hong Kong; the optimal designs of multi-purpose floating platforms to carry a range of superstructures designed to meet various spatial programmatic and functional requirements and sites at different water depths; designing easy-to-instal, reliable, and durable connector systems for joining floating modules under the combination of dynamic (impact and fatigue) loading and a corrosive environment; rapid and precise on-site assembly of floating structures situated at different water levels using innovative construction technology and construction management; active control of dynamic structural movements in the sea during construction and service stages, particularly given the frequency of typhoons in Hong Kong; quantifying the ecological and environment impacts; and obtaining social acceptance. This paper also presents the estimated cost savings using a hybrid approach when compared to a conventional land reclamation approach based on the example of a proposed solution for the Kau Yi Chau artificial island (1000 ha).

AB  - Due to changing public requirements and different user groups needing different residential location, designers are persuaded to concentrate on approaches that will fulfill the preference of users and the requirements of user-needs. However, whether the designed locations and settlements can fulfill the diverse and changing requirements and expectations of users or not, is always open to discussion. This subject is becoming important day by day in countries like Turkey where public change is rapid, and where household change is continuous with families of different size, and of diverse cultural and socio-economical structure. For this purpose, obtaining data that will support the theoretical study regarding the dynamic stucture and location of usage types for the family is important. In this study, the aim is to form the parameters that will obtain data for the accommodations to be designed in the future, by determining the corresponding features of private residential sites where users are not happy with their houses, where the changes they make aims to satisfy their expectations and requirements from the house unit. Under this scope, an in situ observation and a survey with users was made. The observations were performed in two stages, where in the first stage, architectural projects of the sites and houses were obtained from authorities and house-unit usage areas, location sizes and spatial-functional relations were determined; in the second stage, a survey was made with randomly selected users to interrogate the alterations they made in their houses in terms of the house unit plan. They were asked to state the negative features of their houses they are not happy with, the ideal type of accommodation they wanted to own or move to, the type of alterations they have made in their houses. The outcome is that, most of the users are not happy with their original plan types and plan sizes; and almost all have made alterations of different sizes and scales in their houses.

AB  - The techniques applied in this paper were planned to minimise the additional energy and capital costs required for achieving occupant thermal comfort in Chilean residential buildings. Extensive analytical work is reviewed here to assess the influence of building design and operable envelope controls on auxiliary space-conditioning energy. Results of dynamic thermal simulations indicate that indoor comfort temperatures can be achieved all year long at low extra capital and without recourse to traditional space-heating and cooling. The methods applied for this analysis outline guiding principles for designing naturally conditioned dwellings across the country's main inhabited region.

AB  - CASBEE (Comprehensive Assessment System for Building Environmental Efficiency) is an environmental labeling method for buildings, based on assessment of the environmental performance of buildings. In CASBEE, BEE (Building Environmental Efficiency) was developed as a new indicator for assessment following the concept of eco-efficiency. With the increasing BEE value, the total environmental performance of buildings Is labeled from the highest performance. The framework of basic and extended CASBEE tools as a structured assessment system is called the "CASBEE family." CASBEE consists of a set of four basic assessment tools; namely, "CASBEE for Pre-design" (CASBEE-PD), "CASBEE for New Construction" (CASBEE-NC), "CASBEE for Existing Building" (CASBEE-EB), and "CASBEE for Renovation" (CASBEE-RN). These correspond to the individual stages of the building's lifecycle. There are also needs for detailed assessment targeting specific environmental aspects, "CASBEE-HI," as an extended tool, assesses efforts made in buildings to alleviate the heat island effect. A new tool called "CASBEE for Urban Development" (CASBEE-UD) Is developed for assessment of a group of buildings. Some local authorities Introduced CASBEE Into their building administration as assessment methods for their sustainable building reporting systems. This requires building owners to submit a planning document assessing the environmental performance of their buildings to the authorities. In April 2004, the city of Nagoya introduced "CASBEE Nagoya." Introduction of CASBEE followed in the city of Osaka, Yokohama, Kyoto, and other municipals. These local systems require some modification in CASBEE to reflect their local characteristics, such as climate and prioritized policies.

AB  - The modern urban built environment is considered the most energy consuming sector as new forms of construction and services have been applied without complete understanding of their side affects. Therefore, buildings are now dependant mostly on the mechanical equipment to provide comfort. As a consequence, this has led to, firstly, many ecological problems such as the over and misuse of the energy resources, pollution and associated ill-health. Secondly, design without consideration of the local climatic conditions, which can also contributes to loss of identity related specifically to every climatic region, resulting in buildings having the same features all around the world regardless of the cultural, social and physical differences. In Libya, issues related to this subject are neglected or rarely studied. This paper, therefore, aims to highlight some architectural solutions that contribute to reducing building's energy consumption as well as creating an architecture related to the local environment and place. It provides an overview of the general architecture principles and a study of the components of environmental design and the architectural treatment for this climatic zone. A model of a house for Libyan family life will be shown in order to give an idea of the application of some sustainable architectural principles taking into consideration the physical, cultural and social differences.

AB  - Natural ventilation is generally accepted as an innovative green building design strategy and an effective sustainable option. The purpose of the study is to identify where and when the use of natural ventilation cooling can be considered in the predesign programming stage and conceptual building design stage in China. Quantitative evaluations are valued during these stages because the building form determines, in no small measure, the performance of natural ventilation. An ISO-standardized energy performance calculator incorporating a dedicated controllable ventilation model is then proposed as a "pre-evaluation" tool before the design performance modelling stage. Six scenarios in 100 cities under five standards are analysed, including hybrid ventilation with a night-purge ventilation strategy and pure natural ventilation with a window opening strategy. The potential is estimated based on weather, relative humidity, target air change rate, fresh air supply mode, building configuration, and set point schedule which considering night and weekend indirect cooling. For an annual hybrid ventilation conditioned building, Kunming is proposed as a top priority for building site selection among 100 cities. During particular seasons, different climate zones show stark cooling effectiveness, and 60-100% of the cooling demands can be satisfied. For a purely natural-ventilated building, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau and the east of Inner Mongolian Plateau are recommended. Three of 35 observed cities can be satisfied totally by natural ventilation cooling. The necessary generic provisions in terms of control logic are derived and can be used to guide specific design choices. The findings also provide guidelines for adapting Chinese building codes to raise awareness of natural ventilation options.

AB  - The design of high-rise residential buildings in Shanghai has been changing in recent years. This transformation encompassed the changes in: building shape, floor plan composition, the number of apartments on each floor, the functionality of each apartment and living habits. Gianfranco Caniggia's architectural composition and building typology methodology was used to study Shanghai's architectural transformation. The author has found the following trends: 1. Shanghai's high-rise residential buildings are increasingly following the trend of combined apartment buildings that leads to high economic benefit; 2. Auxiliary area, shared between apartments, are accounting for larger portion of a typical floor plan (additional 12-18% of external auxiliary area). Understanding the causes and effects of this transformation in design will provide valuable lessons for other developing metropolitans in China and other countries in the region.

AB  - PurposeCity planning and construction have embraced circular economy principles, converting them into various indicators. Particularly in the European context, the question "what architecture for circularity?" is answered with policies focusing on techniques, materials and disassembling construction. This paper analyzes a new approach to sustainable design and explores the concept of Km0 architecture. The objective is to demonstrate the design strategies of a contemporary architecture based on local resources and knowledge, an architecture that works with the shortest possible loop in circularity, i.e. with the cycle that consumes the least amount of energy.Design/methodology/approachThe paper presents two ways of understanding sustainability in architecture: the first as a result of policies and the second associated with the design and innovative-based New European Bauhaus initiative. Within the scope of this last understanding, the authors analyze three cases on the Spanish Mediterranean coast that have recently received media attention and prominence. The selection responds to a specific climate adaption through a certain typological and functional diversity of the works.FindingsThe studied cases exhibit a more equitable and cost-effective circularity based on the time factor, have long life-cycle designs and serve as repositories of cultural identity. Km0 architecture reduces emissions using local resources and mitigates environmental conditions by combining traditional and modern design strategies.Originality/valueThis paper fulfills an identified need to study the local understandings of the built environment that would ensure a more fair and inclusive European green transformation.

AB  - North America is currently experiencing a housing crisis. Demand for affordable single-family homes far exceeds supply, a situation that is forcing would-be owners to rent until they can afford the available homes that surpass both their needs and means. This situation is not a new one. The return of ten million American war veterans in 1945, coupled with the stagnant state of construction following the Depression years, created a housing crisis on an even greater scale. The crisis stimulated research into new building technology and resulted in the development of new construction materials and new designs for small houses. The objective of the housing industry became the provision of attractive, low-cost homes in a rapid, cost-effective manner. The post-war housing crisis resulted in the application of a wealth of technological and design innovations in what traditionally had been a conservative industry. A similar transformation of the homebuilding industry will again be necessary to rectify current imbalances. In this paper, the author synthesizes the results of a study of single-family, detached housing innovations representative of the period 1945-1959. The author then demonstrates how successful post-war housing innovations can be modified to provide affordable housing today. Three models of affordable homes that were recently designed for the marketplace by the author and his colleagues are presented. They embody principles inspired by the restrictions of the post-war era and that respond to the needs of today's housing user, namely affordability, adaptability, and sustainability. Two of these designs go beyond the drawing board as they have been successfully accepted in at least one North American housing market.

AB  - In this paper, a systematic analysis approach is outlined to design carbon neutral and resilient residential communities in Tabuk region, Saudi Arabia. The design used cost optimization approach to determine the required capacities for on-site power generation and energy storage using renewable energy resources to achieve desired carbon neutrality and energy resiliency thresholds. Moreover, different energy efficiency levels for the housing units are considered to design grid-connected residential communities based on prevalent grid electricity prices and carbon emissions. The analysis indicates that combinations of energy efficiency measures, PV systems, and storage batteries can be utilized to achieve both desired carbon neutrality and energy resiliency levels. The implementation of proven energy efficiency measures can reduce by over 45 % both the annual electricity demands, and the on-site PV capacities needed to reach carbon neutral designs for the residential communities. The cost-effectiveness of carbon-neutral and resilient designs depends significantly on installation costs of PV systems and wind turbines as well as electricity prices purchased and sold back to the grid. The levelized cost of energy for net-zero energy communities can be as low as 0.06 USD/kWh to reach carbon neutrality.

AB  - A gridshell is a structure that gains its strength and stiffness through its double curvature configuration. Its advantages are a minimum use of materials, structural efficiency and the creation of a large volume, as well as the potential for quick and cost-effective construction. However, few gridshells have been built due to a lack of knowledge and data. The process of creating the Downland Gridshell, as a specialist museum workshop completed in the spring of 2002, is a case study of successful collaboration and innovation in architecture, engineering and construction led by a multidisciplinary team of practitioners. This gridshell structure was composed of a double layer of mats comprising four layers of thin timber laths. These were harnessed together as a flat mat and then formed into a three-dimensional structure by a carefully orchestrated lowering of each supporting scaffolding prop, thereby harnessing gravity to pull the mat into shape. Many innovations are described in detail: team working, risk sharing, multidisciplinary design, structural modelling, the creation of new structural components, cladding, and construction processes including the sequence and techniques of gridshell forming. Advances made in this project have added to the knowledge of gridshell behaviour, construction and cost, thereby making the design and construction of future timber gridshells a more viable option.

AB  - Housing policy in the United States now serves an agenda defined by concerns over economic and racial segregation in older central city neighborhoods. HOPE VI, the main US initiative in this area, is aimed at the large-scale demolition of public housing projects and their replacement by smaller-scale, mixed-income developments. The logic model behind the effort to redevelop public housing and disperse subsidized housing residents anticipates benefits at both the individual and community level. Individuals are expected to progress in a range of economic, social and physical ways when freed of the negative area effects associated with high levels of income and racial segregation. Communities are expected to become more livable when rid of dysfunctional and outmoded public housing estates and their discouraging influence on private investment patterns. This paper examines the strengths and weaknesses of this model, assessing, in the process, the potential for achieving the policy goals set out by those advocating dispersal.

AB  - Sustainable building design practices are influenced by requirements, guidelines, criteria for green procurement and certification, assessment tools such as life cycle assessment, etc. This study investigates how such artefacts support or define aspirations towards sustainability, through case studies of public housing projects in Sweden and Cyprus. The study first illustrates how constraints mediated by artefacts set boundaries to the range of available sustainable design options. On one hand, fulfilling sustainability requirements conveyed in regulations, certifications and directives is a major driver of designers' involvement with sustainable design. On the other hand, cost calculations, procurement laws and development plans exclude certain design options. Moreover, default solutions and standardised design guidelines within the organisation streamline and simplify the design process, indirectly determining what sustainable design options are considered. However, these demands and default options are also bent and adapted on a case-by-case basis. The ways in which sustainable design arises from the interplay between artefacts and actors' agency differed significantly between the Swedish and Cypriot cases. Swedish actors' operational definition of sustainability is strongly codified and enforced through inter-connected artefacts. The Miljo center dot byggnad certification is often a de facto definition of sustainability used by actors to set sustainability criteria and targets. Environmental databases for construction products act as black boxes, implicitly determining what aspects of sustainability are addressed in design decisions. Conversely, Cypriot designers' work with sustainability depends to a larger extent on their motivation, experience and ability to convince their peers.

Relatively little is known about the factors that affect decisions by households about whether to renovate and which sort of renovations to undertake. These questions are explored empirically. Separate analyses are conducted of the decision to undertake "major structural renovations" as opposed to other sorts (such as remodeling the kitchen or bathroom), and also of the decision to conduct renovations that add to the living space of the housing unit. Financial, household and geographic factors affecting this decision are analyzed econometrically.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of house prices and their factors provide insights into the demand for housing while helping policymakers implement measures to manage the housing market. Traditional studies either focus more on linear relationships and ignore complex, non-linear influences or consider neighborhood amenities but lose sight of the streetscape. This study aims to enrich the literature by integrating street-perception characteristics with an interpretable machine-learning technique for modeling house prices. Specifically, street-view images were semantically segmented to quantify street-perception characteristics from five perspectives: greenness, openness, enclosure, walkability, and imageability. By combining the determinants of community attributes and living convenience, 17 explanatory variables were fed into a gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT) model to estimate housing prices. The results reveal that the model significantly outperforms the linear model (R2 increased by 47.87 %). Additionally, an improvement of 26.15 % (R2) was observed when streetperception characteristics were incorporated. Moreover, complicated non-linear relationships and interaction effects are discussed by visualizing partial dependence plots (PDPs). These findings offer nuanced guidance for improving the neighborhood environment to promote urban equity and develop a sustainable housing market.

AB  - Domestic alarms are highly personal technological appendages that help us achieve an individual sense of safety and familial well-being-like baby monitors that help us care for children and alarm clocks that ensure a daily routine and help us get to work on time. Alarms can be understood as technologies that extend our eyes, ears, and memory to monitor our homes and ourselves in various ways beyond typical human capacity. The designs of domestic alarms tend to favour audible forms of alerting, and disabled users and inventors have hacked and redesigned alarms to fit their own families' needs. Alarm design can tell us what type of domestic futures designers and technologists have imagined, casting visions about who is fit for parenthood and who is a reliable worker, and what types of futures disabled users imagined for themselves. As the future of these technologies becomes subsumed into smartphones and other IoT devices, a look into their predigital material forms uncovers episodes of disability agencies that assert a right to disability futures of domestic bliss and safety. Through the archives of The Deaf American and other deaf community publications, this research reviews the postwar alarm designs of Emerson Romero, a Cuban-American deaf activist and engineer, to show how deaf-led alarm designs are forms of material rhetoric that assert a right to a domestic future for disabled parents and workers.

AB  - As the importance of building indoor environments has increased recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so has the research on the interrelationship among daylight, human health, and building design. More researchers are studying how daylight affects human health and whether currently known daylighting metrics target human health in addition to building environmental performance. This article provides an updated review of the current review of the literature in the field of daylighting design and human health, particularly as it relates to the impact of daylighting on circadian rhythm, sleep quality and performance. The main objective for this study is to analyze the interrelationships between daylight, health, and design. The review of these articles reveals eight different factors relevant to daylight, in terms of the way daylight impacts people's health, namely light spectrum, light levels, timing and duration of exposure to light. In terms of health impact, these articles outline direct and indirect health outcomes. In addition, our review of the existing literature indicates that there is a lack of proper daylighting metrics as far as design applications.

AB  - The urban living habitat is one of the most important measures of socio-economic well-being in each country. Addressing the urban habitat's lifestyle change and pandemic pressure, the Asian cities, particularly, have found the abrupt transmutes altering local landscape and lifestyle. Cities filled with desires to modernize undertook actions that strained the local culture, perception, and ways of life. Urbanization ultimately mutated the local veins and people. The health crisis brought more changes and demanding a new thinking in provision of building for the built environment. The practice of modularity in architecture provides a fast-track solution to the demand imposed. However, the system must engage the local context, and efforts to interface people, place, and the process. This research aims to formulate the concept of design process based on modular design criteria that subverts the traditional engineering and design thinking and actively adapts to the local people and place to the process. A design consideration framework is combined to develop a preliminary understanding on probable variability and flexibility requirements. By taking the particularity of the place-based people (user), place (environment) and process (technology), the design evaluation could holistically integrate modularity in design. The degree of integration level within the systemic component units developed through "process" evaluation could adequately respond to the user and place need toward well-being state. Findings highlight how the prototype attains typomorphological units while in keeping with development demand in urban areas. The adaptable common, unique, and variant components can be incorporated into a finite typology that may attain morphological flexibility. Aside from responding to emergency architecture, the modularity in design framework emphasizes the importance of innovations in modular thinking as a direct disruption of the customary building and design practice.

AB  - Interventions for sustainability attainment in affordable housing have received increasing attention from policy makers globally. However, policy-makers' interventions for sustainable affordable housing markets can be inefficient and even counterproductive. As such, among the diverse interventions available, a vital question is what are the potential efficient interventions? To address this question, the views of affordable housing experts (also knowledgeable in sustainable housing) around the world were solicited via a questionnaire survey to identify critical success factors (CSFs) for sustainable affordable housing. Relative significance analysis of the data led to the identification of 13 CSFs. Furthermore, agreement analysis revealed that there is no good agreement between respondents from the academic sector and those from the industrial sector on the ranking of the 13 CSFs. Moreover, through factor analysis, the CSFs were grouped into four underlying components: developer's enabling CSFs; household-demand enabling CSFs; mixed land use CSFs; land use planning CSFs. The research findings seek to inform policy-makers on the CSFs for efficient resource utilization for sustainable affordable housing market. Future study would establish a relationship between the CSFs and success criteria for sustainable affordable housing.

AB  - For a significant thrive towards sustainable development globally, sustainability attainment in affordable housing for low-income earners is fundamental. Identifying obstacles to sustainability attainment is primal to successful policy implementation. This study aims to identify critical barriers (CBs) to sustainable affordable housing (SAH) from an international perspective. To this end, 26 barriers were identified from comprehensive literature review and empirical questionnaire survey was conducted with 51 affordable housing experts from various countries around the world. Factor analysis on identified CBs revealed five components: green retrofit-related; land market-related; incentive-related; housing market-related and infrastructural-related barriers. Moreover, rank agreement analysis of the components showed high agreement levels on 'incentive-related barriers' and 'housing market-related barriers' between experts from developing and developed countries. The research findings are relevant to policymakers and practitioners in adopting tactical measures for worldwide SAH. Besides, the identified CBs serve as recommended set of barriers for further empirical study to unearth local variations and context specific barriers to SAH in most countries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Insecurity is one of the scourges that most concern the inhabitants of Latin America, where violence and lack of security make it one of the most insecure regions in the world. Buenos Aires (Argentina) is not an exception to this phenomenon, given that its recent statistics show a growing trend of crimes against people. Poverty can provoke a greater virulence of crime, but the latter also entails social and economic costs that negatively impact welfare and poverty. This paper addresses this second relationship based on the study of changes in the urban configuration and its consequent impact on the welfare of households and firms due to the increase in crime in the city of Buenos Aires. Methodology: A computational general equilibrium model (CGE) with urban characteristics for Argentina was developed in 2011 in order to measure welfare changes, generated by the crime and the costs it generates on the real estate market. As real estate prices were the transmission mechanism between crime and welfare, elasticities were estimated between crime and the price of housing based on a hedonic econometric model. Results: Assuming a 10% increase in the crime rate, the prices of real estate in the relatively richer North of the city can fall to 4%, while they fall less than 1% in the South region. The net effect is a significant drop in the average value of real estate in the city, given that the North is where the most expensive properties are concentrated. These asymmetric results between zones of the city are also observed in the results of household welfare, reducing 8% in the North and 1% in the South. These results on property prices and households welfare induce the relocation of households to the South and of firms to the North, which alters the initial urban configuration. The results correspond with the findings for other cities in South America. Conclusions: An increase in crime in the city of Buenos Aires generates non-negligible welfare costs for families, which produces incentives for the relocation not only of families but also of firms. Consequently, the crime does not turn out to be neutral for the urban and regional configuration, given the interactions between the city of Buenos Aires and the rest of the country. Conclusions such as quantitative results are useful for the design of public policies related to local security and its impact on urban configuration.

AB  - Sustainable building involves reducing negative environmental impacts with a simultaneous increase in life quality. The aim is to optimize building performances while considering all aspects of sustainability: environmental, economic, and social. The building structure determines the building's performances, and it should be designed and evaluated as a subsystem of the building, in line with the objectives of the system-building. This paper investigates structural design based on integrated design objectives within the criterion of social benefits for users throughout the use phase of the building, focusing on protection and safety, aspects of comfort, spatial organization, spatial adaptability, and maintenance. The problem was studied using integrative literature review methodology and system theory. The main findings of the research are a review and critical analysis of the representative literature and the derived conceptual framework for structural design based on the criterion of social benefits for building users, which should support more comprehensive and more efficient decision-making during systemic design and optimization of buildings. The presented integrated literature review indicates the need for the application of a systemic approach to structural design in order to create sustainable buildings.

AB  - Today the concept of net zero-energy building (Net ZEB) is well-known and widespread in the scientific community. Nevertheless, how to effectively transfer this concept into the building market is not as much widespread, especially in Mediterranean regions. In this context, this paper aims at identifying a series of cost-effective technical solutions, supported also by construction details, which can be usefully adopted to define a standard for low-rise residential Net ZEBs in mild Mediterranean countries. The study refers to terraced housing, as it represents one of the most diffuse residential type currently built in southern Europe. The results show that with the suggested solutions - such as increased insulation, use of low-emissive glazing and window shadings, free-cooling through natural ventilation, solar thermal collectors for Domestic Hot Water - common terraced housing can significantly decrease the energy needs and reach the Net ZEB target by using only a limited amount of PV panels. Due to the diffusion of this building type, the technical solution here discussed can be extended to a significant portion of the real estate and effectively considered for the design of future residential Net ZEBs in Mediterranean countries.

AB  - Mongolia is experiencing unprecedented urbanization along with recent economic growth. Ulaanbaatar is known to be the coldest capital in the world and heating demand is very high during the long winter season. Due to the increase of coal burning to provide heat, there is an urgent need to improve housing and to reduce energy use and air pollution. Currently, there is a revitalization of the Ger area of Mongolia and this presents a good opportunity to redevelop the region into an ecologically designed district with sustainable housing. Such a redesign will result in energy saving and air pollution reduction. With this goal in mind, a pilot project called Create Accord Living Environment (CALE), was developed to demonstrate living conditions with a new house design that is cost effective for Mongolia. This paper presents the house performance using an energy simulation and the results are correlated with measurement data taken during the wintertime. The average energy use intensity (EUI) for 5 CALE houses was found to be 112 kWh/m(2)/yr. This is a 71% energy savings compared to a typical detached house with a modern and efficient house design. If it is possible to redevelop 1000 houses in the Ger area, an estimated 6.5 kton/yr in carbon emission can be saved. In addition, a parametric study was conducted to investigate the impact of different construction materials, craftsmanship quality, and occupants' behavior on the house's energy efficiency. The proposed housing structures, which provide a comfortable living space with significantly reduced energy utilization, serves as a potential model for development both within Mongolia as well as for other similar climates.

AB  - Purpose - Iconic buildings, especially museums, are often enrolled in creating an identity for cities, yet cities and museums have been sometimes uneasy partners in using architecture to shape city identity. This paper examines the negotiations of place identity amid the conflicting influences of global design trends and local cultural nostalgia through the case of a single development in Aspen, Colorado. Design/methodology/approach - In this case study, using discourse analysis and grounded theory methods, the authors analyzed interviews, planning documents and critical opinions in the press to reveal the ways in which complex identities and contradictory planning directives shape a single building in a hyper-glocal Western town. Findings - This analysis presents a place with complex and at times conflicting identities: residents have intense local concerns in parallel with global allegiances. The Aspen Art Museum building by Shigeru Ban similarly reflects a complex and contradictory identity with its bold design which confronted notions of local identity expressed in the built environment. Despite engaged citizenry and carefully crafted planning directives, the resulting design did not reflect locally produced culture but instead revealed the influence of international capital in the urban fabric. Originality/value - This study examines the tension between hyper-local concerns and international status enacted on a single site in a small yet metropolitan place in the American West offering insights regarding the emplacement of buildings and the subsequent impacts on a place. As cities and institutions move beyond placeless iconic architecture, architecture and urban planning practice will need to adapt to the new paradigm where buildings can be at once global yet also local, drawing on innovative design practices and local culture in the construction of place.

AB  - The disappearance of an historic building in the consolidated built environment of an historic center leaves a wound calling for reflection. The delicate operation needed to stitch up this lacuna could be likened to that of art restoration or even be classified as an "urban restoration." This essay analyzes the act of reintegration in different branches of the arts including painting, literature, and music and draws conclusions on the need for detailed study of the context of the work to be completed. New design, in this instance, should be carried out in a contemporary manner but in dialogue with its context regardless of the physical and functional autonomy of the building. This essay describes three possible design strategies for architectural reintegration: conceptual, typological, and formal reprocessing. Compositional parameters such as color, geometry, form, volume, texture, materiality, lighting, etc. become tools in an act of allographic completion in which contemporary design professionals intervene within the context of anonymous traditional master builders. Finally, these reflections are illustrated with two case studies, both of which are located in the district of Valencia: the Maldonado building, with a plot, appearance, and setting of palatial buildings, and the nearby Recaredo building, with a floor plan, configuration, and context more suited to that of workers' dwellings.

AB  - Bulldozer urbanism, fraught with violent demolition and forced relocation, exemplifies China's urban transformation. Rural-to-urban migrant workers are particularly vulnerable during the process because of their in-between position in the socialist, territorialised hukou (residential registration) and land tenure systems. This paper presents in ethnographic details the practice of turning shipping containers into rental units for migrants seeking cheap housing alternatives to continue to live on Shanghai's urban fringe. It reveals the nature and constraints of container housing that emerge out of the interplay between China's socialist land tenure system, real estate marketisation, top-down population control and urban governance. Despite the neglected appearance of container housing, its existence and operation entail the acquiescence and surveillance of local state agents as well as entrepreneurs' tactics of conformation, which results in formal informality and sustains structural inequality in state-led development. Container housing also contributes to the deterritorialisation of homemaking among migrant workers, who are channelled by hukou-related policies to invest and retire in their registered home places and feel removed from their urban dwelling in both time and space. The decreased significance of urban residence to migrant workers' everyday life, as exemplified by container housing, facilitates bulldozer urbanism and perpetuates urban exclusion.

AB  - To reach the target of nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEBs), considering occupant behaviour is essential from the early design stage. This study proposes a design support tool for architects, which includes flexible and straightforward occupant behaviour modelling from the pre-design stage onwards. The tool uses a semi-dynamic model. The proposed tool can automatically export building characteristics and occupant behaviour to dynamic modelling for a more detailed assessment further on in the design process. The strength of the tool is its capacity of allowing a fast and consistent estimation with simple inputs of occupant behaviour. The tool is developed for Belgium, but the approach is valid for broader contexts.

AB  - This article presents housing policy and practice recommendations for enhancing the coordination of housing, health, and social care supports for individuals leaving institutional settings. Our recommendations are derived from empirical research conducted in Australia's two most populous states (Victoria and New South Wales) between October 2019 and March 2021 among people leaving residential treatment for mental health and/or alcohol and other drug (AOD) use issues. The period immediately following discharge from these settings is known to involve significant risk of housing insecurity, particularly for vulnerable individuals with complex health and social care needs. In conducting this research, our goals were to identify models of best practice in discharge and transition planning, and to propose strategies for enhancing coordination between residential treatment providers and key social and housing support services to mitigate the risk of homelessness for individuals leaving these settings. This article presents key research findings and recommendations for improving service coordination and transition planning across diverse institutional settings.

AB  - Formulating a unified theory of the built environment may require that the built environment be understood as a complex social-ecological system, where multiple-related metabolisms interact at different scales. From this broad systems perspective, the dividing line between what is considered as nature and what is considered as built environment becomes a cultural attribute that changes with the historical context. Over the past four centuries, notions of environmental accounting and material metabolism have expanded from year-to-year economic and biological exchanges to energy, material, financial, and information flows extended through time and space. At present, the necessary extension of system limits in time and space is best achieved by combining a number of methods, including flow-based models and resource-conservation-based models, and top-down and bottom-up modelling approaches. Artefacts, flows, and actors can be linked over time by means of a common framework for describing the built environment, and by life cycle-oriented product modelling techniques. Despite such advances, existing theory seems incapable of fully integrating spatial and physical relationships, and is especially challenged when dealing with concepts of time. Ecological models provide a useful basis for new timing tools that integrate different time scales, past and future, and that allow for an assessment of adaptive capacity and other aspects of system resiliency. These models can be used to understand better the impact of different managerial and social policies at both the macro- and the micro-level. The management of the long-term evolution of this social-ecological system can only be assured through appropriating ecological concepts of time, and by integrating the history of nature with the history of human culture.

AB  - We deploy a fully coupled thermo-fluidic finite element approach to simulating natural ventilation in a sustainably designed building with complex geometry. The `interlock house' uses building design for climate control instead of mechanical means (such as air conditioning). Therefore, accurately modeling the natural ventilation flows is crucial to assess thermal comfort in such designs. A residual-based variational multiscale method (VMS) is employed, which is a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) type approach to turbulence modeling. The VMS formulation is further augmented with a weakly enforced boundary condition method to efficiently resolve the effect of boundary layers. We validate the framework using a canonical Rayleigh Benard convection problem across different flow regimes. We deploy the framework to analyze thermal flows in the house under two natural ventilation configurations characterized by window opening strategies. Mesh convergence study using one of the configurations is performed to verify the framework. Comparisons of the flow fields and temperature distributions between the two scenarios are discussed. Air diffusion performance index (ADPI) and predicted mean vote (PMV) are computed to investigate thermal comfort in both configurations. This work illustrates the ability of the framework to comprehensively model and predict natural ventilation under various operating scenarios.

AB  - Referring to recent history, it is easy to perceive that there is an expansion of urban areas and a need for improved transport infrastructure all over the world. These events have led to congested, unsafe and inefficient vehicle transport networks along urban roads. The situation is worse in the cities of developing countries like India because of the faster growth. The promotion of education, increase in urban population density and change in the lifestyle of city dwellers has paved the way for immediate requirements in extensive expansion of road infrastructures. The extent of transport system expansion depends on the urban form, trend of traffic movements and population. In this paper, an attempt is made to arrive at some conclusion regarding the relationship between the urban area, traffic characteristics and transport infrastructure based on a study conducted in the three major cities in Kerala Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Calicut.

AB  - Models calculating the environmental benefits of renovation and retrofitting of buildings are generally based on energy calculations and don't take into account the environmental penalty of demolishing and replacing parts of the building and its equipment. The environmental effect embodied in these activities is neglected and only the environmental benefits of a lower building related energy use are taken into account. In addition, energy use cannot be considered an environmental problem in itself, but causes several environmental impacts, which are not necessarily linearly related to the energy use. In this paper, the author studies the relative values of the embodied environmental impacts and the operational environmental impacts, as well as the relationship between energy use and environmental impacts. The calculations are based on a tool for energy use calculations and on EcoQuantum, a tool for life cycle assessment. Results are presented in terms of environmental payback times. The results are discussed and clarified based on two case studies. Recommendations are made about the necessity of a dynamic simulation procedure.

AB  - This paper analyses the relative merits of demand-side and supply-side strategies for attacking the housing problems faced by low-income renters. The analysis is distinctive in that it takes seriously the emerging consensus among international housing scholars about the centrality of housing quality sub-market dynamics and spatial considerations. Received theory about the nature of housing sub-markets and their adjustments to policy interventions is used to critique previous evaluations of supply- and demand-side approaches and to provide fresh insights into their ability to achieve a wine variety of programmatic goals. Numerous dimensions of spatial considerations-externalities, area-wide abandonment and revitalisation, local reinvestment psychology, racial and economic integration and freedom of household locational choice-are applied to a further consideration of these two strategies, again using several alternative goals. Finally, the paper argues for the importance of context-driven housing policy formulation. Problem definition, goal weighting, and metropolitan housing market, socio-economic, and governmental characteristics collectively must be considered before an unambiguously 'best' housing strategy can be identified. Nevertheless, the payer concludes that, with the typical context, the demand-side approach is superior to the supply-side approach.

AB  - Building materials are factors that cause environmental impacts in construction sector. Among those materials, wood has many benefits in building design in terms of sustainability such as lower energy consumption and lower greenhouse gas emissions in production. Due to insufficient wood resources in Taiwan, wood is imported from many regions of the world. This paper aims to investigate environmental impacts of three different regions that provide wood resources for wood structure construction in Taiwan. Regions have been investigated including West Canada, Pacific Northwest and Southeast in the USA. Methodology of life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied to the research in the analysis with environmental indicators such as energy consumption, global warming potential, acidification potential and air pollution. Results show, firstly, that wood manufacturing process is the major contribution in energy consumption, global warming potential and air pollution in three regions. However, acidification effect is caused greatly from the fact of long marine transportation. Secondly, wood resource from Canada for building structure in Taiwan has the least environmental impacts compared with wood resource from the USA. Therefore, it is suggested that the use of wood from Canada can mitigate environmental impacts toward the goal of sustainability.

AB  - In this paper, we studied the influence of interest rates on a US-based real estate private equity index as well US Wilshire public equity REIT Index. The interest rates that are chosen as independent variables include Monthly LIBOR, Yearly LIBOR and the Federal Cost of Funds Index. The dependent variables include US-based real estate private equity index that includes quarterly returns of 1,035 real estate funds, including liquidated funds formed between 1986 and 2018. The other dependent variable is the US Wilshire REIT Index. The variance of returns of interest rates considerably influences the variance of returns of the US PERE Index, whereas variance of returns of interest rates doesn't influence the variance of returns of the US Wilshire REIT Index. Also, the real estate index is positively correlated to interest rates and so rising interest rates influence the returns of US PERE Index in a positive manner. The study shows that private equity real estate investors should expect higher return as the cost of funds increase.

AB  - The global building sector, responsible for over 30% of CO2 emissions, necessitates urgent decarbonization efforts. This paper examines residential building decarbonization policies in three major economies-the European Union (EU), China, and India. It provides an overview of diverse policies through policy landscape analysis and delves into the design specifics with a detailed policy intensity analysis of building energy codes, information disclosure, and financial incentives in each region. Our findings reveal a diverse mix of policies targeting residential building decarbonization in all three regions. While the EU and China have long-established diverse policy instruments, India's building energy efficiency policies are relatively recent and limited. Detailed analyses of building energy codes, information disclosure, and financial incentives expose variations in ambition, scope, and implementation, even with shared policy instruments. Significant advancements in building energy codes, particularly in stringency and compliance checks, are evident in the EU and China. Conversely, India faces a notable obstacle with limited adoption of residential building energy codes, impacting its journey towards net-zero. The EU leads in building energy labelling policies, while China and India encounter various challenges hindering widespread implementation. Financial incentives across the three regions predominantly take the form of subsidies, potentially straining public budgets. The study concludes with reflections on the pressing need for future research extending beyond the operational phase of buildings.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to assess thermal comfort conditions in vernacular dwellings in western sub-Saharan Africa. The paper identifies six vernacular and low-tech building typologies specific for selected countries. Comparative analysis of user comfort and thermal performance of case studies, representative for each typology was carried out, as the first step towards climate resilient, sustainable and bioclimatic architecture in the region of the investigation. The measurements of temperature, relative humidity, indoor air quality and daylighting as well as the user satisfaction survey were performed in February 2019 and repeated in August 2019. It was determined that during the hot and dry season, the indoor temperatures of 26-30 degrees C were achieved in traditional dwellings (Typologies I-IV) and accepted by 60-70% of inhabitants, while in 'modern houses' (Typology VL2 and VI) the level of user thermal comfort was significantly lower (only 20% felt comfortable). During the colder wet season 90% of users felt comfortable in vernacular dwellings and only 50% in 'modern houses'. High levels of CO2 concentrations were detected in dwellings with tight envelopes (1800-1900 ppm) due to the lack of adequate ventilation. In pursue of solution various air exchange rates were examined to check how they comply with the user thermal comfort perception. It was found that the optimal ventilation should provide the air exchange rate of 0.5 VR/h which allows to fulfil minimal demands of ISO and ASHRAE standards. The study established the baselines for sustainable, bioclimatic, affordable housing model for western sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - The protection of cultural heritage is essential to preserve the memory of the territory and its communities, but its enhancement is also important. In this perspective, the theme of choosing the best use for historic buildings, which often make up a substantial and widespread part of real estate and which can become a driving force for the sustainable development of cities, is important. These decision-making processes find effective support tools in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, able to consider the multiple financial, social, cultural, and environmental effects that the enhancement project generates. In order to identify the most appropriate evaluation approach to select the best use of the building, this paper proposes a comparison between some of the best-known MCDM methods: Analitic Hierarchy Process (AHP), ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalite (ELECTRE), Tecnique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and the Compromise Ranking Method (VIKOR). The comparative analysis gives rise to the validity of the AHP, which is useful for reducing the problem into its essential components, so as to make a rational comparison among the design alternatives based on different criteria. The novelty of the research is the characterization of the hierarchical structure of the model, as well as the selection of criteria and indicators of economic evaluation. The application of the model to a real case of recovery and enhancement of a former convent in the province of Salerno (Italy) verifies the effectiveness of the tool and its adaptability to the specificities of the case study.

AB  - This paper presents a building-level post-hazard functionality model for communities exposed to flood hazards including the interdependencies between the population, buildings, and infrastructure. An existing portfolio of building archetypes is used to model the post-hazard physical flood functionality of different building typologies within the community with the goal of supporting resilience-informed decision-making. Specific fragility-based flood functionality curves were developed for this portfolio to quantify the exceedance probability of a prescribed set of functionality states. While the physical functionality of buildings is significant to the total functionality of a building and community resilience assessment, the functionality of utilities such as power and water along with the accessibility of the household to essential services such as schools and hospitals is crucial to measure their total functionality. Therefore, functionality models for essential infrastructure were developed to assess housing unit- and building-level functionality following flood hazards. This model also accounts for the functionality of the road network following a flood hazard to identify the level of accessibility of households to different services (e.g., schools, hospitals, gas stations, shopping centers, etc.). The main novelty of this paper is the ability to quantify the total functionality of buildings based on a socio-physical formulation after including the interdependencies between the functionality of the physical systems and the subsequent functionality of the socio-economic systems, which is key to measuring resilience at the community level. This was evident from the analysis results using a testbed community of Lumberton, NC, showing that the physical functionality is not sufficient to quantify the total post-hazard functionality of buildings and that the functionality of other subsystems such as utilities and accessibility to essential services are also needed to quantify the total functionality of buildings and the livability of households.

AB  - This study analyzes the long-run relationships and short-run dynamics of four commercial real estate indexes (NAREIT, NCREIF, CoStar and Green Street Advisors) to evaluate whether evidence of commonalities can be found across these indexes or whether they exhibit divergent behaviour over time. Evaluating a period beginning January 1998 and ending in December 2016, the findings indicate that each CRE index can be characterized as stochastic data generating processes. Further, evidence of statistically significant structural break is observed within each series, approximately towards the latter part of 2008. Multivariate analyses indicate that each index is integrated with one another and with economic indicators over the long-run. Next, macroeconomic shocks are imposed on each CRE index before and after the 2007-2009 housing crisis to analyse their behaviour over the short-run. Results indicate the reaction of each index from shocks to key economic indicators is similar although the NAREIT index reacts most vigorously while the NCREIF index responds least intensely. Finally, CRE shocks are imposed on each of the macro-economic indicators to evaluate whether the CRE indexes have a reciprocal impact. The findings suggest that each of the CRE indexes has a more pronounced effect on the economic indicators with the NAREIT index inducing the strongest response.

AB  - In the contemporary human community relations, great attention is paid to social sustainability due to its ties with the local identity and social culture. That is, the common spaces are considered as the social arena that creates a high opportunity for people to bond and interact. In light of this, this study aims at highlighting the importance of such spaces through a case study of the apartment building in Amman, and its impact on social sustainability. Several issues were addressed in order to develop insight into this relation, namely, social equity, social capital, civic engagement, community stability, place attachment, and safety and security. A mixed-method approach was adopted in this research that entailed spatial analysis of layouts of 65 apartments' building, an on-line survey of 197 residents of apartments' buildings, and face-to-face interviews with 30 architects and developers. The results of this study bring to notice that apartment building in Amman is deficient in indoor common spaces in terms of functionality and that the few indoor common spaces that are found are mainly limited to circulation paths with no hierarchical system. This finding underlines a crucial need for formulation of design guidelines for multi-family housing with the consideration of social sustainability as an integral part in the infrastructure. These design guidelines, once formulated and enacted, will guarantee provision of indoor common space qualitatively as a hub for a wide range of activities.

AB  - Kirk McClure's article makes important contributions to our understanding of the way in which state allocating agencies are using the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). However, one of the premises of his analysis - that allocating agencies should encourage the location housing developments in census tracts with a osurpluso of low-income renters - is mistaken. Census tracts are too small to be considered closed-system housing markets. Additionally, the LIHTC program does not exist in isolation, but instead as part of a combined national rental housing policy that includes both supply-side programs (LIHTC) and demand-side programs (housing vouchers). A final flaw in the notion that LIHTC units should be built in census tracts with a surplus of renter households in the 30% to 60% of AMI range compared with the units affordable to them is that increasing the amount of affordable housing in those tracts could have the effect of further concentrating households by income and race.

AB  - This study compares Choosing By Advantages (CBA) and Weighting Rating and Calculating (WRC) as Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods in how they support collaboration in groups, particularly pertaining to design decisions involving sustainability factors in architecture, engineering and construction industry. This study is based on an experiment done with 15 practitioners, where they formed 5 groups of 3 people each. The experiment used multiple baseline testing (MBT) and all groups made 12 decisions. The initial decisions were made using the WRC method and later, in a staggered manner between the fifth and ninth decision, the groups were taught to apply the CBA method. The CBA method is considered to be the intervention in the experimental design. Four dependent variables were analyzed: (1) time to reach consensus, (2) satisfaction with the final decision, (3) personal frustration during the decision, and (4) perceived frustration from others during the decision. The results showed with statistical significance that CBA was faster than WRC for reaching consensus and presents less personal and perceived frustration during the decision. The results do not show statistical support in favor of any method regarding satisfaction with the final decision. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Representing one of the largest energy consumer, the building sector is an important issue in terms of energy consumption and climate change mitigation. In this sense, many different actions of building energy savings have been started. Among them, retrofitting measures have been taken for different building scales from the single housing units up to the district or building stock. Finding retrofitting solutions for a single house is relatively easy, whereas the building stock dimension remains a complex issue. To facilitate the work of building stock owners and local public authorities, the developed method allows identifying groups of buildings and also at the scale of the building stock to be used as input for the retrofitting actions optimization The proposed approach consists in clustering the buildings of a given stock according to their characteristics before refurbishment - intrinsic variables as the geometry or the thermal properties - and the resulting variables as the total or heating energy consumption. Consequently, a methodology based on a clustering analysis has been implemented. It consists of successive clustering steps on a "decision space" containing the intrinsic building features and an "objective space" enclosing the energy performance. One of the main results is knowledge that the usual building classification based on climate, year of construction and type is not always sufficient and justified: compactness and height of should also be taken into account.

AB  - Drawing on cases from the tropical and subtropical worlds (in Australia and Southeast Asia), we employ southern architectural examples to interrogate normative assumptions around climatic design. As the foundation for a new history of climatic design, this article seeks not only to challenge northern, temperate views of climate in the age of the Anthropocene but also to emphasize tropical zones as a significant paradigm for architects to consider. Our three case studies (i.e., early climographs, the Singapore building code, and the Malay house) delve into some of the Others of climatic design in the southern hemisphere, reassessing the legacy of Asian vernacular architecture. Together, these examples offer new interpretations on race and labor, passive cooling, building codes, and visual models used by architects to represent tropical climates. These case studies reveal that southern climatic models are not simply neutral representations and remain deeply entangled with biased assumptions around cultural identity, place, and historical contexts.

AB  - The aim of this study is to develop a prototype of a building fa & ccedil;ade inspired by traditional techniques, materials, and details in a semi-cold climate zone. Sar & imath;hac & imath;lar village was chosen as a case study, because the traditional buildings of the village have high energy-efficiency and environmentally friendly techniques. The main scientific novelty and aim of this study is to demonstrate the contribution of new technologies and equivalent building materials (Crushed autoclaved aerated concrete-CAAC/Adobe with gypsum-AwG) and details to reduce of the Uvalue of the traditional rubble stone (RS) walls by designing a prototype fa & ccedil;ade. The key considerations in the design were user comfort, climate-sensitivity, respect for local identity/culture, energy-efficiency, inspiration from historic passive technologies, and low cost. To evaluate the efficiency of the prototype fa & ccedil;ades, field studies and literature research were conducted, and the IZODER TS825 program was used. The results of the study showed that two proposed wall types (CAAC&AwG) &AwG) with different porosity and particle size achieved better results by contributing significantly to the reduction of the U-value compared to the traditional walls with RS. This is important not only for the design of buildings with high comfort buildings, but also for combating the negative effects of climate change.

AB  - Buildings represent the major energy consuming sector in India. Sustainable and climate responsive architecture offers possible solutions to this high energy demand. Vernacular buildings, in contrast to modern 20(th) century buildings, are more climate receptive to the environment and are based on principles evolved over many generations. The traditional architecture of housing in Chettinadu, Tamil Nadu, India is known for its use of natural and passive methods for a comfortable indoor environment. However, it has not been proved by a detailed and quantitative evaluation method so far. A summer field study was thus conducted to investigate the indoor environmental conditions in such housing. The objective of the investigation was to understand the solar passive features in Chettinadu housing by qualitative and quantitative analysis of thermal comfort parameters. This was undertaken by continuously monitoring the indoor and outdoor conditions using a custom made instrument called the "Architectural Evaluation System". The results showed that the natural and passive climate control system of this traditional housing style provides a comfortable indoor environment irrespective of the outdoor climatic conditions.

AB  - Buildings contribute significantly to climate change, accounting for 20 % of greenhouse gas emissions and over 40 % of global primary energy consumption. As the world's population grows and living standards rise, building energy use rises. Climate change is expected to impact interior environments, leading to uncertainty in analyzing energy and thermal usage of existing structures. Among the effects of climate change is a temperature increase that affects the indoor climate. Understanding future climate scenarios and their impacts can enhance the adaptability of existing buildings. The article extensively analyzed how climate change affects the energy usage of housing developments to address this problem. This study aims to determine the thermal behavior of existing buildings in Jordan in present and future timeframes, considering the effect of different orientation scenarios. Using Design Builder software, a family's home in a Hot Semi-Arid Climate zone presented by Amman City is modeled, and its internal circumstances are documented for the current climate and the next 40-70 years' predictions. Larger homes will see higher fluctuations in their energy load than smaller homes. Based on Ko<spacing diaeresis>ppen climate classification of the present and future times, the findings indicate that by 2100, mechanical cooling will be needed most of the time. Even with suggested tactics, the structure will not be pleasant without conditioning. The research indicates that the climate zones in Amman city are expected to shift from their current classification to arid zones with two distinct thermal regions, according to the climate maps provided. This transition is predicted to increase cooling loads significantly, rising from 2544.90 kWh/year to 4076.34 kWh/year, while heating loads are predicted to decrease from 4197.56 kWh/year to 3719.15 kWh/year. Moreover, the outcomes of the orientation scenarios analysis are that the total electrical loads in the present and future timeframes were at their lowest values when the building was oriented 180 degrees counterclockwise, while the building recorded the highest value in its baseline orientation scenario.

AB  - Energy conservation and carbon reduction in buildings have become important concerns and, at the same time, the value of low-tech approaches employed in indigenous architecture is increasingly acknowledged as a pertinent reference for contemporary design practices. The research on vernacular dwellings in Jiangxi has many perspectives and fruitful results, but not enough attention has been paid to the research on climate adaptation. This article verifies the vernacular dwellings' climate adaptation and summarizes the low-tech methods embedded in vernacular dwellings, aiming to provide guidelines for future exploration of energy-saving and carbon-reducing practices in architecture. By selecting different types of vernacular dwellings in Nanfeng County, this article verifies three aspects of the ecological characteristics of vernacular dwellings: the light environment, wind environment, and energy consumption, by comparing them with those of local modern residential buildings. It is concluded that the average daylight factor of the hall area of vernacular dwellings is better than that of the modern residential buildings in rural areas, and the vernacular dwellings regulate the indoor wind environment and maintain indoor comfort through natural ventilation in winter and summer seasons. Also, the annual energy consumption of the vernacular dwellings per unit area per year can be reduced by up to about 32% in comparison with modern residential buildings. Subsequently, the article concludes that patio space has a positive impact on the indoor physical environment through comparative experiments. Vernacular dwellings are well adapted to the local climate in terms of form, structure, and materials, and these low-tech methods should be applied to the design of rural dwellings in the future.

AB  - Case management has become the predominant model for attempting to improve outcomes for young adults experiencing both homelessness and unemployment. However, there is little evidence-based knowledge about how young adults respond to case management, and how much intervention is needed to be effective. This Australian study utilised quantitative government data to investigate the effects of the amount of case management on key outcomes. With a purposive sample of 224 people aged 18-35, this study compared four different amounts of YP4 case management service received over a three-year period. Participants were categorised into four groupings depending on the number of case management contacts they received: 0-5, 6-20, 21-40, and 41-156. The findings show some significant group variations over the course of the trial in the areas of employment and accommodation. Participants who received 20 or more contacts had significantly better accommodation and employment outcomes than those who received fewer contacts.

AB  - Social justice movements significantly changed design culture over the last twenty years. The disabilities rights movement, in particular, has had a profound impact on building design. But there has been more attention to accommodating mobility and sensory issues than cognitive issues. Built environments can pose many barriers for people on the autistic spectrum (AS) due to their unique cognitive structures. Although design for people on the AS has received attention by designers and architects, existing design guidelines often lack a scientific basis and may lead to questionable outcomes. Further, useful knowledge from scientific research is not being applied consistently in design for this group. To bridge the gap between research and practice, the authors applied knowledge translation methods to the existing scientific knowledge on theAS to produce design recommendations for classrooms. This paper describes the knowledge translation process used to identify key knowledge in this field and examples of how it can be applied in design. The implications for future research on the topic of knowledge translation in design for the Autistic Spectrum (and design in general) are provided.

AB  - The paper aims to enable a comprehensive definition for a Circular Economy (CE) that will support its effective introduction in the building and construction sectors. According to the European Commission (EC), the building sector in 2020 accounted for 40 % of the primary energy demand in the European Union (EU) and 37 % of its greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the sector can play a crucial role in decarbonisation and hence in achieving a zero-emissions future in response to climate change. A CE aims to harmonise economic growth with environmental protection and is based on the concept of closing the loop with minimal practical waste as in a natural ecosystem. The adoption of CE concepts is therefore seen as a feasible response to climate change through the deployment of more sustainable construction processes that significantly reduce the need for natural resources by maximising recycling and reuse. However, and despite the recognition of the potential of a CE in relation to sustainability issues, the adoption of a CE model within building and construction sectors is challenging because of the wide range of aspects and priorities which are reflected in the diversity of definition resulting in a narrow and limited adoption. There are currently many definitions of CEs as related to building and construction in the literature, creating confusion and preventing effective implementation. The study presented here intends, using a comprehensive literature review as its basis, to define the key domains of a CE on which to align a concise and accurate definition that will enable effective application in the building and construction sectors. The research also aims to identify current research gaps and barriers to contribute to the future of CE research in the building sector and thus drive the implementation of CE projects to mitigate the effects of climate change and support the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by laying the foundations for a novel and forward-looking approach to circularity based on properly established, defined and understood principles of CEs.

AB  - The built environment puts major pressure on the natural environment; its role in transitioning to a circular economy (CE) is therefore fundamental. However, current CE research tends to focus either on the macro-scale, such a seco-parks, or the micro-scale, such as manufactured products, with the risk of ignoring the additional impacts and potentials at the meso-scale of individual buildings. This article sets out to unpack the fundamental defining dimensions of a CE and frame them for CE studies for the built environment. A critical literature review forms the basis for identifying and framing such fundamental dimensions. Our contribution highlights the key roles of interdisciplinary research and of both bottom up and top-down initiatives in facilitating the transition to 'circular buildings'. The frame for reference has been used to capture current discourse on the sustainability of the built environment and has proved to be a valuable tool to cluster existing initiatives and highlight missing links for interdisciplinary endeavours. The article represents a contribution to the theoretical foundations of CE research in the built environment and a stepping stone to shape future research initiatives.

AB  - While the built environment negatively contributes to resource use, waste generation, and climate change, this same sector has the potential to provide innovative solutions to these complex global challenges. Circular economy (CE) strategies have the potential to provide these solutions, yet systems and incentives related to CE and the built environment are disparate and at varying stages of development. Green building rating systems, such as the Living Building Challenge, have the potential to change the market and drive innovation, but these systems need to evolve and change in alignment with the emergence of new and promising strategies, such as CE. The objective of this study was to elucidate whether implementing CE practices could help further reduce embodied carbon and life cycle carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq.) emissions in buildings that are already environmentally conscious to further drive market innovation. This study analyzed the potential reduction in the embodied carbon of an existing Living Building, the Frick Environmental Center, by applying various CE strategies and using life cycle assessment. The investigated strategies include (1) using materials that are biodegradable and have lower embodied carbon, (2) using salvaged alternatives for embodied carbon-intensive building products, (3) extending the lifespan of selected building materials, and (4) carbon sequestration. Given that the case study building is already LEED Platinum and Living Building certified, the results elucidated the extent of potential environmental impact savings in buildings that are already certified due to having lower environmental impacts than the industry average. The CE strategies resulted in a 30% reduction in the building's embodied carbon (excluding end-of-life) compared with the base case. Results exemplify whether a significant decrease in the buildings' embodied carbon/life cycle CO2-eq. emissions can be achieved as a result of implementing modest changes in design.

AB  - Voucher-based programs have become the most common form of housing assistance for low-income families in the United States, yet only a slim majority of households that are offered vouchers actually move with them. This article uses data from 2,938 households in the Moving to Opportunity demonstration program to examine whether child characteristics influence the probability that a household will successfully use a housing voucher to lease-up. Our results suggest that while many child characteristics have little bearing on the use of housing vouchers, child health, behavioral, and educational problems, particularly the presence of multiple problems in a household, do have an influence. Households with two or more child problems are 7 percentage points less likely to move than those who have none of these problems or only one. Results suggest that such families may need additional support to benefit from housing vouchers or alternative types of affordable housing units.

AB  - Projects financed through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program, the largest producer of affordable housing in the United States, face ownership transition after 15 years in service when tax-credit investors leave. In Detroit, Michigan, projects whose transitions were complete but that were subject to additional affordability restrictions fared much worse than national surveys showed. Many projects continued to provide affordable housing, but a share experienced mortgage or tax foreclosure, and many units became permanently uninhabitable, increasing disinvestment in neighborhoods. Projects reaching year 15 from 2016 through 2022 were under considerable financial stress as of 2015 and would likely need financial restructuring. Few high-capacity nonprofit developers existed to assume property ownership. The intervention of mission-driven syndicators helped stabilize numerous projects. Detroit's experience illustrates the challenges LIHTC projects are likely to face in weak-market cities. Additional studies should investigate the year-15 challenges in diverse housing markets and the efforts to address those challenges.

AB  - Many older American cities lost population during the last three decades of the twentieth century, but while cities such as Boston or New York saw numbers of dwelling units remain stable or even increase, others such as Buffalo, St. Louis, Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh lost large fractions of their dwelling units. This study decomposes decadal population changes from 1970 through 2000 for 351 US cities into household size, housing unit, and occupancy rate effects and finds substantial stock declines (as high as 50%) in many cities. It then develops a supply and demand model to model central city housing unit supply elasticities, with special emphasis on "kinked supply"-inelastic in the negative direction and elastic in the positive directions. Supply elasticities for housing unit decreases were between +0.03 and +0.13. For housing unit increases the elasticities were between +1.05 and +1.08. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The upward trend in the residential sector of energy use has significant consequences in terms of environmental impacts. Determining the carbon metric (CM), as part of the whole carbon footprint of a building, contributes to quantify the carbon emissions related to the building's use stage. Although many carbon footprint calculators exist in other sectors, none has been specifically designed and applicable to the building one. However, ISO 16745 provides guidelines for calculating and reporting the CM of existing buildings in operation. In this context, this work sets a methodology to measure the CM of existing households' use stage, based on ISO 16745 and split into three stages. The implementation of the methodology to a case study proved its applicability since it enabled the data collection task through the designed survey, and allowed the energy carriers and end-uses be disaggregated, quantified and clearly reported for user's knowledge. The study outlined that calculating the CM and, more specifically, reporting and making the results publicly available, help raise users' awareness about reducing greenhouse gas-related emissions, and provide new ideas for monitoring, benchmarking and proposing policies at individual member state and EU levels.

AB  - Green building development in China relies mainly on compulsory measures that lack incentive policies to motivate the enthusiasm of real estate developers. A floor area ratio bonus is encouraged by the Chinese State Council. In order to ensure the feasibility of a reward quota, residential buildings that met the requirement for energy efficiency during the official assessment in Ningbo in 2014 were selected as research objects. The amount of energy and water savings in terms of the Assessment Standard for Green Building is converted into carbon emissions. Carbon emissions of different star-rated green buildings are then measured in accordance with the actual water and power consumption of residential dwellings in 2014. A regression equation is set up concerning the floor area ratio and index for residential land per capita. A carbon emission-based method is proposed for measuring the reward quota associated with floor area ratio and recommendations are given for development using green building.

AB  - Many towns and cities in the world experience the process of urban shrinkage. This may be observed in localities of different types and of all sizes, including a large group of post-industrial towns and cities of Central and Eastern Europe. One of the districts affected by the urban shrinkage process is the Katowice conurbation in Poland, which may serve as a good example to consider the potential for introducing the idea of sustainable development. In this perspective, sustainability is considered as a specific challenge within the progress of regional transformation, but also a target concept for a large urban region to be followed throughout the evolution and at particular stages of the change. In the discussed region it is all the more important because it is followed by phenomena related to post(industrialism), relatively high pollution levels compared with the European average and a polycentric system of settlement. This paper states that the current urban policy implemented in the Katowice conurbation does not seem to have any palpable effect reversing the trend of depopulation in the region, which seems to stem from the fact that numerous initiatives undertaken in the area are illusory' and often unnecessary and unjustified. This also applies to activities embracing and fostering the idea of sustainability. With regard to the latter issue, the main concern refers to overinvestment and wasting the measures to reduce low emissions and to make savings in the heat supply system for residential buildings. The Authors proposed a new vision for the transformation of the region. It will respond to the current and expected needs of the residents, while making allowances for multidimensional sustainable development, particularly in terms of housing policy and spatial development. This concept primarily focuses on a new balance between the areas covered by low-rise and high-rise buildings and the reorganisation of the structure of the local economy.

AB  - There are accounts of increasing anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues among students and staff at many universities, including the University of Ottawa-accounts borne out by official numbers of referrals to mental health practitioners. The causes of these issues are frequently sought within individuals themselves; the solutions are assumed to lie in therapy, counseling, or medication. In cases where the reasons are sought externally, they are attributed to workloads, interpersonal conflicts, racism, sexism, or financial difficulties. These are all, without a doubt, valid causes for ill health. Could another reason for the seemingly general failure to thrive among staff, faculty, and students on the University of Ottawa campus, however, be connected to the campus itself? It is, after all, a known fact that we are all dependent upon and deeply reactive to our environments. From Vitruvius to Ruskin to Pallasmaa, theorists have made the link between the built environment-architecture-and wellness. Architecture has the power to make us feel anxious, alienated, and unseen, or to increase our sense of belonging, collective and individual identity, sense of place, security, and tranquillity. Sacred architecture appears to play a particularly pivotal role in this-to people of all faiths and none. This paper seeks to explore whether the University of Ottawa could potentially reverse the upwardly trending numbers of poor mental health by creating a sacred-architecture-centric campus that meaningfully and materially honours not only the school's history and motto, but also its location in the Ottawa valley, on the unceded land of the Algonquin, as well as the current religious and cultural diversity of its students.

AB  - We investigate whether the consensus of institutional investors to buy, sell, or hold a particular property type in a particular quarter can improve the information environment in commercial real estate markets. In particular, we analyze the drivers of investor consensus as well as the informative value of buy and sell consensus for future returns. For the period of 1996 to 2018 and for eight sub-property types, we find that private leasing (space market) information predominantly drives the buy and hold consensus, while private asset market information is more important for the sell consensus. Publicly available equity and debt capital market information has the highest explanatory power for the sell and hold consensus. Furthermore, buy and sell consensus has informative value for future returns. The component of buy consensus that is explained by private information has the highest informative value for future returns, particularly in periods of financial crisis and poorly performing real estate markets. On the other hand, the component of sell consensus that is explained by public information has the highest informative value for future returns. Our findings have implications for institutional investors and portfolio managers as they suggest that the survey-based consensus of institutional investors contains valuable information to formulate return expectations, identify trends, and make investment decisions.

AB  - At present, there is less attention paid to the relationship between the frequency of travel and built environment, especially in households. In this paper, some of the determining factors in the frequency of daily cycling per household were explored based on the data from 2018 Daily Trip Survey in Xianyang, China. Then a two-level linear model was construct to identify the determining factors in the frequency of per capita daily cycling of household. According to the research results, 22.8% of the differences in the per capita cycling frequency of household are due to the differences between communities. In terms of community factors, the densities of road networks and educational facilities delivered a significantly positive impact on the per capita daily cycling frequency of family; on the contrary, the densities of medical facilities, intersections and POI delivered a significantly negative impact. Per capita cycling frequency varies considerably between households. For instance, the number of bicycles owned and the number of school-age children have a significantly positive impact on the per capita daily cycling frequency of family. However, car ownership, household income and occupation composition impose a significantly negative impact. The findings of this study would benefit the transportation engineers and planners who are keen to boost the use of active means of transportation for residents.

AB  - This study aims at assessing external effects of built environment. A hedonic model is employed to assess the percentage impact of area typical building structure on location desirability. We control for location by application of a decentralized approach based on potentiality variables and micro-level data. After controlling for legal building density, location and neighborhood characteristics we find that building structure proves to be a significant determinant for the value of urban land. While areas dominated by Wilhelminian-style attached arrangements generate premiums of up to 7.7%, properties embedded into a post-war modern-style building structure sell at significant discounts of up to 7%. These results not only highlight the role of built environment as determinant for attractiveness of urban location but also allow a considered evaluation of a range of policies for city development. Taking as a basis the market results, it is evident that the policy of careful renewal running since the 1970s enjoys a higher acceptance among; the citizens of Berlin than does a policy epitomized by the radical city rebuilding during the postwar period. However, for the Hansaviertal, which was designed in the course of the Internationale Bauausstellung 1957 by some of the Internationale Bauausstellung 1957 by some of the internationally most recognized architects of that time, we find a significant market premium of 17.6% exceeding the value for all building structures of similar density. Compared to the average modern 1950s developments there is even a mark-on of 21% emphasizing the role of architecture for properties intrinsic value. After all, our results suggest that interventions by the State aiming at improving the quality of architectural and urban designs may be justifiable in terms of welfare and economics and may contribute to an increase in the attractiveness of downtown locations. Our results also indicate that a high building design quality does not necessarily require a historic style in order to impact positively on location desirability.

AB  - Reducing energy use in buildings is a critical component of meeting carbon reduction commitments. There are several ways of accomplishing this goal, each of which emphasizes actions by a different set of stakeholders. This article argues that building users play a critical but poorly understood and often overlooked role in the built environment. In the face of climate change, the article finds purely architectural solutions, such as those proposed by the Architecture 2030 Challenge, to be necessary but not sufficient to achieve climate change mitigation targets. To fully address the task ahead, it argues that architects need to develop their professional expertise to improve buildings and seek ways of integrating user involvement in building performance. Moreover, from a professional standpoint, this paper suggests it may be wise for architects to claim a leadership role in this area before another group of building professionals does.

AB  - The European building stock was renewed at a rapid pace during the period 1950-1975. In many European countries, the building stock from this time needs to be renovated, and there are opportunities to introduce energy efficiency measures in the renovation process. Information availability and increasingly available analysis tools make it possible to assess the impact of policy and regulation. This article describes methods developed for analyzing investments in renovation and energy performance based on building ownership and inhabitant socio-economic information developed for Swedish authorities, to be used for the Swedish national renovations strategy in 2019. This was done by analyzing measured energy usage and renovation investments made during the last 30 years, coupled with building specific official information of buildings and resident area characteristics, for multi-family dwellings in Gothenburg (N = 6319). The statistical analyses show that more costly renovations lead to decreasing energy usage for heating, but buildings that have been renovated during the last decades have a higher energy usage when accounting for current heating system, ownership, and resident socio-economic background. It is appropriate to include an affordability aspect in larger renovation projects since economically disadvantaged groups are over-represented in buildings with poorer energy performance.

AB  - Occupants play a key role in determining final building energy consumption. Empirical evidence must support occupants' modelling. Experiments on human responses to Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) are usually performed in test rooms or as in-field monitoring. Between these two approaches, living laboratories, often abbreviated as living labs, represent a valid alternative due to their resemblance to real-world settings. This allows observing actual behaviours while keeping the capability to reliably monitor and control the indoor environment. This work systematically reviewed the available information from 34 living labs for human comfort studies worldwide to define the scope, characteristics, and significance of living labs, for the first time. Most of the reviewed living labs are office environments, and only a few do not involve a university research institution in their operation and management. Most of them are in Europe and the United States, whereas there is a lack of such facilities in other locations and climate zones (e.g., tropics). A larger number of comfort studies in living labs is required to clarify the differences in the knowledge acquired in these experiments compared to in-field and laboratory ones. The review shows that living labs add opportunities for testing and optimizing in-novations in human-centric solutions for comfortable green buildings. Through the living labs approach it is possible to holistically capture the influence of IEQ on occupant perception and the related response, to gather data on larger and more diverse groups of people, and to conduct multi-domain comfort studies involving multidisciplinary approaches given their real-life settings.

A survey questionnaire administered to about 1,300 respondents from 15 villages (classified as remote rural, rural, and semi-urban) yielded their perception of different dwelling environment issues. The statistical analysis of bioclimatic dimensions indicated a significant difference among the dwellings. The low-cost mud houses of the remote rural and rural areas in coastal regions often follow local practices. Besides, different dimensions covered in the survey provided insights for the comparative evaluation of different categories of dwelling units. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified the clusters and component structures of the built environment characteristics provided from the response of the villagers as their perception of the dwellings. PCA yielded three components-1) interior design (PC1, building form, partitioning of rooms, type and materials of the wall, roof and window), 2) innovation of the built environment (PC2, building envelope, insulation, and sanitation facilities), and 3) natural ventilation priority (PC3, window design, window opening, and glaze material), which together explained 69% of the total variance. The psychrometric chart provided in identifies passive design strategies in constructing dwellings to improve residents' yearly total thermal comfort hours in hot and humid regions. The relative contributions to thermal comfort hours are sun shading of windows (25.5%), a passive solar direct gain high mass (6.2%), a passive solar direct gain low mass (0.4%), and a high thermal mass, including night flush (4.3%), direct and two-stage evaporative cooling (4.3%), and natural ventilation and fan-forced ventilation cooling (2.2%).

AB  - The development of sustainable, and ecologically-sound building components from natural and renewable sources is a key element in the reduction of energy and resource consumption in the building sector. Especially with regard to embodied energy, locally sourced wood- or plant-based products are favorable to conventional alternatives, and are able to responds to society's increased demand for sustainably manufactured goods. Therefore, advancing and facilitating the product development of bio-based building components is a pivotal method to foster sustainability in the built environment. This paper introduces a novel approach to the systematic development and production of bio-based products in order to decrease resource and energy consumption and increase recyclability by letting bio-material grow directly into a near net shaped topology.

AB  - Humanitarian agencies often reach for new designs and technologies in order to meet basic human needs. In the field of emergency shelter, one of the most widely publicized new designs is the Ikea refugee shelter: a flat-packed, mass-produced structure that can be shipped and constructed wherever it is required. This shelter aspires to be a universal solution, but since its formal launch in 2013, it has met with criticism and many challenges in the field. Deployed in political contexts in which people have very different expectations of basic shelter, the Ikea shelter demonstrates the limitations of universal standards, the inequities of humanitarianism, and the entwinement of biopolitics and the politics of life.

AB  - The phenomenon of homelessness in Europe has attracted increasing interest of late due to the rise in the number of homeless people and variations in their characteristics. This qualitative research explores the potential of Sen's Capability Approach to deepen our understanding of the recovery processes of individuals who have experienced homelessness. Through a case study, the representation developed by Robeyns is used to examine the experiences of 19 individuals. Data collection involved workshops and interviews across different life stages, analysing participants' goals, barriers, and achievements in relation to homelessness. Results show that while housing provides stability and confidence, personal preferences shape their views on well-being, such as prioritizing relationship employment or mental health. The study emphasizes the importance of recognizing the identities and agency of homeless individuals while underscoring the complexities of analysing agency within homelessness pathways, advocating for further exploration of its role in overcoming homelessness.

AB  - A new master plan for the historic city of Bet She'an opens the opportunity for climatic design on an urban scale. Bet She'an is one of the oldest cities in the Middle East, with archeological layers dating from 1900 BC. Egyptians, early Israelites, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, early Moslems, Crusaders, Ottomans and more recently British and Israelis were dominant cultures that lived in Bet She'an. Each used a unique strategy to adapt the built environment to the harsh climatic conditions which exist at the margin of the very hot, arid Jordan Valley, which is the lowest part of the known Syro-African Rift Valley. Despite an impressive history of climatic adaptations, the last two generations have not effectively utilized the experience of previous inhabitants. One of the aims of the master plan is to reintegrate the climatic design at all levels, renew the historic features and thereby improve the climatic quality. Analysis of climatic data served as a starting point for the identification of planning problems. The master plan solutions are presented on 3 scales: (1) overall urban scale; (2) neighborhood scale, and (3) individual building scale. It is the scope of this study to present the climatic rehabilitation of an ancient city as part of a process for the general understanding of our history and environments and to create guidelines for future climatic rehabilitations of cities.

AB  - Appreciating beauty is a positive human feeling. In architecture and design, it is associated with the usefulness of products to meet needs. Those products are well received by users. The designer's task is to achieve perfection in their work. The rational design of artificial living environments is also an expression of concern for a sustainable environment. The interdisciplinary New European Bauhaus is interested in these issues. This paper indicates the role of beauty and utility in the built environment. They are analyzed in the context of social and technical conditions and contemporary sustainable design. Its goal is to expand the knowledge of beauty and usefulness in architecture. They are increasingly important in the sustainable development of the built environment. This article uses research methods: interpretive research, analyses, comparisons, logical argumentation, etc. Innovative qualitative research in the form of a checklist is used. This survey can be used to rationally evaluate architecture and interior facilities. It can be helpful for various sustainable aesthetic and functional strategies dedicated to designers and users. It indicates possible directions for further assessment of architecture, e.g., in the context of management, environment and identity in the era of digitalization. It can be helpful in assessing the quality of the built environment.

AB  - Medium Density Housing (MDH) is advocated for sustainable urban growth while retaining the amenity and liveability of lower-density urban forms. Despite these advantages, affordable and diverse MDH proves challenging to implement in suburbs with access to employment and services. While scholars do explore barriers and solutions to implementing MDH in Australia, regional city contexts are less understood. Stakeholder perspectives on MDH and its implementation are also limited. This research presents a stakeholder analysis in the regional city of Cairns to address these important gaps. The research employs a case study approach including semi-structured interviews with 19 stakeholders across public and private sectors: developers, architects/building designers, government and industry planners and real estate agents. Stakeholders expressed barriers that are well-documented in the literature-such as the risk-averse nature of the finance sector-but also note key regional differences such as land constraints in world heritage areas, poor public transport, distance from supply chains, soaring insurance costs and susceptibility to cyclones. In the face of these challenges, Cairns stakeholders argue for certain forms of MDH alongside strategic planning, leadership, cross-sectoral and community engagement to support effective MDH infill. These insights are pertinent to other regional cities struggling with MDH in low density contexts.Practitioner pointersMDH needs contextualisation in places outside Australia's capital cities, as demand and supply side issues require nuanced understanding.Cross-sectoral conversations are key to understanding the complex barriers and opportunities for MDH in regional cities.Strategic planning for where to locate MDH is vital in a context of climate change and coastal hazards.

AB  - This paper proposes a framework of support for reducing barriers to curriculum access for students with disabilities in higher education (HE), by drawing upon findings from a unique longitudinal qualitative study. The 'Longitudinal Transitions Study' commenced in 2010 and followed the transition experiences of a group of 80 young people since they left compulsory education, 32 of whom went into HE. Interviews were conducted with participants at several key stages of their time in HE and supplemented by focused case study work with seven of the participants. The analysis provides original examination of how appropriate balance can be achieved between broad inclusive practice and individual adjustments meeting specific needs. Key curriculum access issues identified in the study are outlined with examples of how these were overcome through 'inclusive practice', 'individual adjustments' and 'individual agency' of the student. Drawing upon a Bioecological Model of Inclusive HE, a framework of support is proposed for achieving appropriate balance through the notion of progressive and mutual accommodations to facilitate learning environments which enable students with disabilities to become independent learners. The paper has broader significance for educators and researchers concerned with promoting inclusive teaching in HE and ensuring equality of opportunity for all students.

AB  - The recession has created significant challenges for the government with regard to providing affordable housing. Even during the UK's housing boom the supply of housing failed to keep pace with demand. Therefore, increasing housing supply and improving affordability in a recessionary period will require the government to innovatively utilise their limited resources. Following the Comprehensive Spending Review in 2010 severe cuts to the housing budget were made and radical reforms to housing and planning policy have been proposed by the coalition government. The paper briefly discusses the UK housing market and affordable housing policy and practice recently employed in England. Subsequently a discussion of the coalition government's recent reforms to housing and planning policy, concerning affordable housing, is presented.

AB  - Green vertical systems have advantages in terms of building energy performance, but their environmental impact should be assessed in comparison to un-vegetated constructive systems. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the environmental loads of a green facade, which was compared to other building exterior wall systems. A Life Cycle Analysis approach was used to compare the green facade with constructive solutions commonly applied for enhancing the thermal insulation properties of the building exterior walls. The green facade and the other constructive solutions were characterised by an equivalent thermal behaviour. A green facade system prototype, realised with vegetation climbing on a steel frame, was used for the study. The comparison was carried out with exterior walls using insulation materials as expanded polystyrene, expanded cork and wood fibre. A double wall with an un-ventilated air gap was used as well. On average, the best environmental performance was recorded for the wall using cork as insulating material and for the double wall. The results highlighted the environmental criticalities of the green facade as the system having an environmental load among the most burdensome. Different scenarios of green facade with the use of alternative constructive solutions were hypothesized and compared by the life cycle analysis and life cycle impact assessment. The study showed that the adoption of a wooden frame in place of the steel one, as plant supporting structure, reduces the carbon footprint of the green facade by 58%. The environmental comparison was carried out also considering non-vegetated constructive solutions having an equivalent sun shading effect on the wall. The analysis showed that the green facade has the best environmental performance when compared with sun shading systems in aluminium or PVC.

The aim of this research is to assess the economic benefits of sustainable construction in Greece. A questionnaire posed to 19 experts (consultant engineers, construction managers and contractors) based on the Delphi technique was carried out in order to gather experience on the economic benefits of sustainable construction. In particular, it is more economical at the operation phase of life cycle assessment and sufficiently important to be adopted at the design phase. Among the economic benefits of sustainable construction, reduce energy usage (REU) ranks first, followed by protection of the natural and social environment (NSE) and providing a healthy comfortable living environment (HLE). The results of the study show that the majority of experts believe that sustainable construction is overall more economical than standard practice.

AB  - This paper presents a simulation study to reduce heating and cooling energy demand of a school building in Seoul Metropolitan Area, Korea. The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of passive vs. active approaches on energy savings in buildings using EnergyPlus simulation. By controlling lighting, the energy saving of the original school building design was found most significant, and increased by 32% when the design was improved. It is noteworthy that energy saving potential of each room varies significantly depending on the rooms' thermal characteristics and orientation. Thus, the analysis of energy saving should be introduced at the individual space level, not at the whole building level. Additionally, the simulation studies should be involved for rational decision-making. Finally, it was concluded that priority should be given to passive building design strategies, such as building orientation, as well as control and utilization of solar radiation. These passive energy saving strategies are related to urban, architectural design, and engineering issues, and are more beneficial in terms of energy savings than active strategies.

AB  - Studies show that the government's role can improve low-cost housing (LCH) to achieve SDGs linked with housing. LCH provision as a government social responsibility to achieving Goal 11 may raise critical issues in Malaysia. Therefore, this study investigated the factors hindering Malaysia's Government from providing LCH as a social responsibility to achieving Goal 11. The research adopted a qualitative approach via phenomenology. It covered four major cities in Malaysia and achieved saturation at the 35th selected participant. Findings reveal that housing provision for all Malaysia's low-income earners (LIEs) is an issue. The complexity of the problems, such as government inadequate funding, housing market financialisation, faulty LCH registration system, LCH high development and construction cost, under-declaration of household income by an unqualified person, LIEs collateral lacking, inability to provide 10% down payment, reluctance by mortgage institutions to lend loans to LIEs, entitlement syndrome, and inadequate LCH data sharing between federal and states governments may hinder Malaysia's Government alone from LCH provision as a social responsibility to the low-income groups. Findings show that achieving Goal 11 may be threatened if these issues are not addressed and suggest measures to improve LCH to achieve Goal 11 via all-inclusive mechanisms.

AB  - Effective use of daylighting is an essential component to achieve a sustainable building design. In a tall building, the amount Of Useable space with a potential for the use of daylight is the space between the exterior wall and the core. This is commonly referred to as the 'lease span'. Class A office buildings in the USA have typically utilized lease spans of around 45 ft (13.7 m), primarily due to efficiency of space usage. In Europe, however, lease spans in high-rise office buildings have typically been shortened due to concerns of natural light penetrations and views. For instance, in Germany, the amount of leasable space per floor is less than in the USA. The maximum allowable depth of space in Germany is typically about 18 ft (5-5 m), whereas in the USA, as much as 50 ft (15 m) is no rarity. The lease span also has an impact on other items, such as the aspect ratio, floor-to-floor height, total height and total floor area. In this study, to assess and predict daylight performance, two different requirements were analysed: daylight factor (DF) and the daylight requirement of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) 2.2 green-building rating system. The recomended average DF (DFave) ranges from 2 to 5% ED 2.2 requires that a minimum daylight illumination of 25 footcandles be achieved in at least 75% of and LEED all regularly Occupied areas. This study conducted a series Of computer Simulations using RADIANCE to first show the effects of each of the fenestration parameters and then to provide an optimum effective aperture to meet the two daylight requirements in four lease span types ranging from 20 to 50 ft. As a final step, regression models and simple evaluation tools were developed to correlate the DF, daylight requirement in LEED 2.2 and the various fenestration parameters, such as window area, visible transmittance and lease span in four different cities (London, Chicago, Dubai and Bangkok). This paper provides a simplified method for evaluating indoor daylight performance to meet the two daylight requirements. This can be used is a pre-design too], not only to achieve more credits in LEED 2.2 green-building rating systems, but also to evaluate based on DFave to ensure that the building meets the recommended level.

AB  - Istanbul Bosphorus is one of the most important protected landscapes of T & uuml;rkiye with its dramatic topography, natural landscape, and historical and cultural heritage embedded within this natural setting. However, studies focusing on the visual landscape assessment (VLA) of Bosphorus are limited. The main goal was to evaluate the VLA of Bosphorus and to understand the users' perception of this multi-layered landscape via utilizing VLA based on the evaluation of 45 photographs taken from the sea. For this goal, the study investigates the environmental texture proportion (ETP: vegetation, built environment, sea, and sky) and RGB values of the photographs using parameters such as naturalness, beautiful scenery, disturbance, excitement, safety, and livability in 5-Likert's scale. Findings demonstrated that photographs with more vegetation than built environment, with those containing 10 % or more vegetation receiving higher overall scores. Vegetation showed a high positive correlation with naturalness, beautiful scenery, excitement, safety, and livability. Moreover, disturbance was positively correlated with the built environment, and negatively correlated with vegetation. Namely, the most problematic ETP type for VLA was the built environment in Bosphorus. The study further identified built environment characteristics as a critical environmental component, with historical and mansion-type buildings scoring higher than other building types. Another important finding was that certain user features, such as gender, influenced perceptions of beautiful scenery (9 p-value), excitement (10), safety (11), and livability (21), while usage frequency affected perceptions of excitement (14) and safety (13). In other words, men gave higher scores to photographs compared to women, and users who regularly utilized the study area rated the photographs more favorably than those who used it less frequently. In conclusion, the study found that user characteristics of gender and usage frequency were influential factors, and vegetation (10 % and above) was the most paramount element for preferences when considering the visual landscape of the Bosphorus in Istanbul.

AB  - The built environment plays a significant role in material consumption and CO2 emissions, necessitating a proactive shift towards a circular economy (CE). Technical innovations (TIs) are recognized as one of the key drivers in advancing the circularity of the built environment. However, the comprehensive understanding of TIs' influence on the lifecycle and metabolism of construction materials is yet to be explored. Concrete, being a vital construction material, holds particular significance in assessing the effectiveness of CE strategies in the built environment. Hence, this study develops a continuous material flow analysis-based system dynamics model to analyze the impact of TIs in concrete components and construction processes on the CE, adopting a perspective that aligns with real-world logic, thereby reducing the complexity of the dMFA method. Our findings demonstrate that the adoption of different TIs can enhance circularity and resource efficiency within the system by influencing the four circular flows (4Rs). Under stable stock conditions, the combined application of these TIs can yield a maximum reduction of 71 % in inflows and prevent 65 % of natural stock resource losses attributable to their influences on circular flows, as compared to the reference scenario devoid of TIs. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the scenario contributing the highest circular flows does not necessarily optimize resource savings. Therefore, when devising CE strategies, careful consideration should be given to the underlying impacts of circular flows rather than solely focusing on maximizing the flows themselves. These results, in conjunction with geographical spatial features, can guide the design of appropriate technological interventions tailored to the local built environment, thereby enhancing the efficiency of CE strategies. However, as the data utilized in this paper are derived from literature, we believe that further case studies are warranted to refine these general findings and mitigate the limitations in both quantity and quality of data, thereby enhancing their contextual relevance.

AB  - This study analyzed subjective transportation deficiency, in terms of missing activities due to lack of transportation, of the older population aged 65 and over in the United States. This study found that those who have lower personal automobile accessibility and minority females are more likely to experience transportation deficiency. Older people who have lower income, have lived for a relatively short period (3-10 years) in their communities, and live with minors are also more likely to experience lack of transportation. Older people who live in suburban communities have greater transportation deficiency, but the placement of activity locations within walking distance can improve transportation deficiency among older people who do not drive. The availability of public transit services within walking distance and knowledge about transportation alternatives do not significantly affect the transportation deficiency of the older population. The results indicate that a substantive focus should be given to how to help the older population keep driving as long as they can, and aid communities with high concentrations of older minority females. Also, developing activity clusters containing commercial and social service facilities in suburban areas with high concentrations of older populations, has the potential to alleviate transportation deficiency among this widely observed group of people who age in place.

AB  - PurposeWith access to the large-scale search data from Rightmove plc, the paper firstly indicated the possibility of using user-generated data from online property portals to predict housing market activities and secondly embraced a GIS approach to explore what people search for housing and what they chose and investigated the issue of mismatch between search patterns and revealed patterns. Based on the analysis, the paper contributes a visual GIS-based approach which may help planners and designers to make more informed decisions related to new housing supply, particularly where to build, what to build and how many to build.Design/methodology/approachThe paper used the 2013 housing search data from Rightmove and the 2013 price data from Land Registry with transactions made after the search period and embraced a GIS approach to explore the potential housing demand patterns and the mismatch between searches and sales. In the analysis, the paper employed the K-means approach to group prices into five levels and used GIS software to draw maps based on these price levels. The paper also employed a simple analysis of linear regression based on the coefficient of determination to investigate the relationship between online property views and values of house sales.FindingsThe result indicated the strong relationship between online property views and the values of house sales, implying the possibility of using search data from online property portals to predict housing market activities. It then explore the spatial housing demand patterns based on searches and showed a mismatch between the spatial patterns of housing search and actual moves across submarkets. The findings may not be very surprising but the main objective of the paper is to open up a potentially useful methodological approach which could be extended in future research.Research limitations/implicationsIt is important to identify search patterns from people who search with the intention to buy houses and from people who search with no intention to purchase properties. Rightmove data do not adequately represent housing search activity, and therefore more attention should be paid to this issue. The analysis of housing search helps us have a better understanding of households' preferences to better estimate housing demand and develop search-based prediction models. It also helps us identify spatial and structural submarkets and examine the mismatches between current housing stock and housing demand in submarkets.Social implicationsThe GIS approach in this paper may help planners and designers better allocate land resources for new housing supply based on households' spatial and structural preferences by identifying high and low demand areas with high searches relative to low housing stocks. Furthermore, the analysis of housing search patterns helps identify areas with latent demand, and when combined with the analysis of transaction patterns, it is possible to realise the areas with a lack of housing supply relative to excess demand or a lack of latent demand relative to the housing stock.Originality/valueThe paper proves the usefulness of a GIS approach to investigate households' preferences and aspirations through search data from online property portals. The contribution of the paper is the visual GIS-based approach, and based on this approach the paper fills the international knowledge gap in exploring effective approaches to analysing user-generated search data and market outcome data in combination.

AB  - Most residential homes in developing countries such as India sell before construction is complete. Completed or move-in ready homes command a premium because of the compounded cost of capital and uncertainty costs incurred over time from holding under-construction homes. In this paper, we use listing data from India's six largest urban agglomerations (UAs) between 2010-2012 and show that sellers expect 2-15% move-in ready premia in five UAs. Moreover, in four UAs, individuals reselling homes expect five to eight percentage points higher move-in ready premia than developers selling new homes because of additional costs incurred by individuals from holding under-construction homes. We do not find any evidence of substantial speculative gains among individual resellers. At mean listed prices, the expected move-in ready premium is 383% of an average household's annual income in Mumbai, India's most expensive city. Our findings indicate that within the context of a developing country, lengthy construction times and expensive capital exacerbate already poor affordability conditions.

AB  - Planning policies in Europe and elsewhere increasingly promote urban densification as the spatial planning solution for achieving urban sustainability goals. However, examples from several cities have shown the complexity, in practice, of translating densification's potentials for creating environmentally, socially and economically sustainable compact cities. Although extensive research is already available on the sustainability dimensions of densification, the social dimension has, in general, been under-researched. Specifically, spatial associations between densification and its potential social impacts have received little attention. This paper aims at contributing to filling this gap. The aim is twofold: first, I analyse overlapping spatial patterns of densification and housing accessibility, which I consider to be an indicator of social sustainability; second, I explore mechanisms that may hinder the possibility of combining urban densification with an inclusive housing offer. The findings are based on a mixed-method approach, consisting of a quantitative assessment of housing accessibility and a spatial and policy analysis of urban densification. Using Oslo as a case study, I argue that, in a context where the market rules the planning system and housing policies, densification may eventually compound market logics and exacerbate social exclusion dynamics.

AB  - Green buildings not just help to reduce energy and resource consumption, but also to improve user experience and satisfaction. The former relies on technical advancement, while the latter needs empirical evidence. In the past decades, numerous post-occupancy studies have been conducted to investigate green building occupant satisfaction in different regions; however, a systematic review of these studies is lacking. This study reviews the global evidence to examine whether green buildings are more satisfactory than non-green buildings. The performance of green buildings in terms of occupant satisfaction appeared to be inconsistent, varying from study to study. The evidence on green buildings outperforming non-green counterparts is inconclusive. Sample size, occupancy period and green features are discussed as the main bias accounting for the inconsistency of the global evidence. In spite of the inconsistency and inconclusiveness, this study identifies two global contexts: the Occident (mainly U.S. and U.K.), where no significant differences were found on occupant satisfaction between green and non-green buildings, and the Orient (mainly China and South Korea), where green building occupants showed significantly higher satisfaction compared to non-green building occupants. This paper contributes to the understanding of socio-economic factors underlying green building occupant satisfaction, and also provides evidence for commercial and institutional sectors, where green buildings are used to improve employee satisfaction.

AB  - In Argentina the percentage of energy consumption for space heating in buildings is around 30%. In the school buildings in the province of La Pampa (in the central region of Argentina, betweeen 35 and 39 degrees of south latitude) the percentage of heating energy is around 90% (10% = electricity consumption = lighting and appliances). The measured energy consumption is higher than the value estimated according to the Volumetric Heat Loss Coefficients (G-value) and Base Temperature (18 degrees C), indicating that the students and teachers work with temperatures higher than that value. The cost of the consumed energy corresponds to 17% of the total spent by students. In this context two solar schools (Promoter Entity: Ministry of Culture and Education) were built in different regions, one of great agricultural potential l- cattleman (Catrilo); the other, a semi-arid region with low population density (Algarrobo del Aguila). Both buildings were designed with passive solar design strategies that exploit the building's orientation, shape, materials, windows, and external landscaping, in combination with passive solar heating systems (direct solar gains through transparent areas and ventilated facade panels) and cooling (natural ventilation and earth-to-air heat exchange through buried pipes), to create a pleasant environment which is less dependent on fossil-fuels-based energy. The schools were evaluated through the results of thermal monitoring and surveys, carried out to analyze the behaviour of the occupants, who explicitly control and affect the internal environment. In the Algarrobo's school the occupants (mostly with two or three garments inside the classroom - Tshirt, sweater and jacket) were comfortable with temperatures around 17 degrees C. The heating practically doesn't light during the day and goes out at night. The energy saving in heating is around 90%. In Catrilo's solar school, the average daily temperatures in the classrooms are around 21 degrees C in winter. indoors, the students wear only two garments - T-shirt and sweater - or only a pinafore. The heaters work during the entire night and the energy saving is 50%. The results show that the area of comfort doesn't have clearly defined limits; instead, they are defined by those conditions in which a feeling of discomfort doesn't take place. The implementation of passive solar design strategies allowed an energy saving in heating between 50 and 90%, which in turn means a reduction Of CO2 emissions. In the case of non-residential buildings, through the technology applied to the envelope design in solar school buildings, the G value was reduced by 35%, decreasing from 1.40 W/m(3)degrees C (average value for conventional school buildings in La Pampa) to 0.97 and 0.90 W/m(3)degrees C at schools in Catrilo and Algarrobo del Aguila, respectively. The use of solar technology allowed a noticeable reduction of natural gas consumption in heating, constituting a major contribution in areas of temperate to cold climate, where the greatest energy consumption in buildings corresponds to heating. In view of these G values and direct gain values oscillating between 11 and 14 % of the building's useful area, a solar school building may consume at least 50 % less energy in heating to meet occupants' comfort standards. In the case of the school built in Algarrobo, with an average temperature of 17 degrees C, the consumption was equivalent to the 15% of the average energy consumed by other schools located in different places of the province. The qualitative and quantitative analyses carrie out showed promising results related to the buildings' energy behaviours, yet it cannot be denied that there are certain factors that have direct incidence on the optimal energy behaviour of buildings and their thermal comfort: (a) exogenous factors (the high variability of the external physical environment), (b) endogenous factors (construction characteristics) and (c) socio-environmental factors (life-styles and behaviour of dwellers, associated with the active energy contribution and use of heating). The true challenge for solar energy architecture is to simplify technology and construction processes so that costs would not be higher than those for conventional buildings, assuring users' proactive behaviour towards the correct building's thermal management. To involve users in these improved practices is yet another challenge.

AB  - The transformation of Medellin in Colombia is well known to urbanists. A highly contested, violent and unequal city in the 1980s and 1990s, Medellin's Social Urbanism ushered in a series of ambitious reforms that reimagined public space and mobility. These were designed to address challenges related to violence and inequality, concerns which are present both in Medellin and across the Latin American region. In examining the relationship between architecture, politics and peacebuilding, we consider how the role of architecture was and is conceptualised in the city's socio-political transformation and how the changing form and use of the urban built environment contributed to shaping conditions for peace to emerge. Drawing on qualitative interviews with key stakeholders, we show that while the challenges of violence remain, the architectural and the political became intrinsically entwined to both build peace in the city and forward a new image of Medellin both internally and externally.

AB  - This article discusses the potential of introducing sustainability in the architectural design method so that building solutions can contribute to sustainable development. Sustainability has introduced a new pattern to the architecture practice, which involves important modifications in the teaching of architecture in what regards to the design methods to students but also practitioners, in order to provide more comfort for present and future generations. In the design phases of the architectural design, the subject of the three pillars of sustainabilityeconomic, social and environmental factorsare not always considered by the architect in the decision-making process. The topic involves actions that will influence the overall performance of the building throughout its lifecycle. Sustainability has not been a priority in the training of the architect. The existing tools, Sustainability Assessment and Certification Systems, although adequate to evaluate the sustainability component of a building, do not prove to be the most appropriate tool to support architects during the design process. Therefore, the implementation and evaluation of strategies that integrate the sustainability principles need to be included in the early stages of the architectural design method. In addition to collecting data through literature review, a survey was conducted among 217 architects and architecture students in order to access the need for a tool that supports architects in the issue of sustainability. The results concluded that, although all the respondents agree about what concerns the implementation of sustainability principles in the architectural design method, only few respondents guarantee that these principles are implemented by means of a rigorous evaluation. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify a set of guidelines that can help architects to change the current approach of architectural practice towards more sustainable strategies in building design. This means the introduction, implementation and evaluation of sustainability principles in different phases of the architectural design method. The proposal stresses the main strategies that need to be considered in each phase of the architectural project and defines a level of recommendation in each guideline that allows the architect to evaluate the implementation of sustainability.

AB  - Climate analysis tools are complementary to building performance tools because designers need the ability to assess the potential effects of climate on specific building solutions. Although several existing climate analysis tools exist, many depend on static comfort models for fully space conditioned buildings, do not cater for free-running buildings in hot humid climates and require significant analytical expertise. Architects and urban planners need the ability to assess the potential of applying bioclimatic design strategies, in relation to adaptive comfort models within cities with hot humid climate, at relevant cities scales. Therefore, we present a climate analysis tool that can make climate analysis more accessible, practical and useful in hot climates. Firstly, we performed a climate zoning based on altitude, solar irradiation and dry bulb temperature. Secondly, we developed a bioclimatic analysis based on temperature and humidity levels. Focus group discussions involved 40 architects to assess the further develop the tool. In the paper, we show how the open-access tool provides building professionals a simplified method of climate zoning and a more convenient way of determining the best available thermal comfort models and suitable design solutions. This study contributes to research efforts that analyses and visualise climatic data for sustainable building design.

AB  - The building sector currently contributes approximately one-third of energy-related CO2 emissions worldwide. It is economically possible to achieve a 30% reduction. However, numerous barriers such as financial and behavioural issues, market failures, and misplaced incentives prevent the realization of the high economic potentials. Which policy instruments are the most appropriate and cost-effective for reducing these barriers? To address this question, 20 policy instruments were assessed for their effectiveness in reducing emissions, cost-effectiveness, applicability and special conditions for success. The appraisal is based on over 60 ex-post policy evaluation reports from about 30 countries and country groups, representing best-practice examples of the application of these instruments. Appliance standards, building codes, tax exemptions and voluntary labelling were found to be the most effective policy instruments contrary to others such as Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms or energy/carbon taxation. The most cost-effective instruments, all achieving energy savings at negative costs for society, were appliance standards, demand-side management programmes and mandatory labelling. Since all policy instruments have limitations and only help overcome some barriers, they are most effective if combined into policy packages designed for the respective location, economy and culture.

AB  - Building in higher education institutions (HEIs) are characterized as energy intensive Experience from practice showing large discrepancies between predicted and actual energy performance. The deviation can sometimes reach 100%. Explanations often originate from occupant's behaviour along with building operation. IoT-based smart tools can provide extensive information about building usage to improve the building management, often associates with opportunities, for significant energy saving. The analysis in this study investigate space use based on occupancy and booking information in eight different lecture rooms at Umea. University. The results suggest interventions for significant saving potentials, such as modification of access permission and closing down redundant lecture rooms.

AB  - The increasing concerns on sustainability oriented on buildings have added new challenges in building architectural design: the necessity to combine environmental, economic and social variability in the design process. Nature has provided us with enormous intelligent design solutions that are sustainable and healthy. Sustainable design should integrate and balance the human geometries and the natural ones. Mathematical description of nature specifically is based on fractal geometry. This paper gives a brief description of fractal geometry theory and presents its current positioning and developments through illustrative review of some fractal case studies in architectural design. Its purpose is to convey our viewpoint that fractal geometry is a powerful tool for characterising patterns and structures of relevance to architecture design and for allowing to designing and underpinning complexity. This paper provides a bridge between fractal geometry and architecture design.

AB  - Most recent discussion of the adaptive reuse of school land has focused almost exclusively on repurposing or redeploying vacant school space rather than comprehensively re-planning and constructing the entire school land for the overall needs of society and urban development. The relevant government agencies for school land reuse in Taiwan, such as the Ministry of Education and municipal governments, mostly provide subjective regulations or revitalization provisions for the sustainable development of school resources; however, no specific scientific assessment or a planning procedure has been proposed to revitalize school land. Therefore, constructing a scientific, quantitative, and objective planning framework and procedure is necessary for the adaptive reuse of school land based on the needs of overall society and urban development in order to replace the existing and outdated planning philosophy and to correct prominent shortcomings of past planning operations that were solely in accordance with the qualitative judgment and decision making of official agencies. In this study, we mainly adopted the analytic network process (ANP) and big data, including demographics, facility usage, and social welfare indicators, to assist the Taipei City government to construct or reform land reuse strategies for junior high and elementary schools facing immediate or future closure, consolidation, or downsizing. To take a more realistic approach to improve final decision making, the investigation of expert questionnaires through the ANP was based on the consideration of future trends that were objectively evaluated by big datasets. The novel planning philosophy and concise decision framework for reuse strategies we designed are expected to improve public decision-making transparency, adaptive reuse effectiveness, and quality of urban life. Ultimately, our proposed strategies and suggestions can not only assist local public sectors to promote the policy of adaptive reuse of surplus school lands but also serve as an appropriate blueprint of urban sustainability for the central government in the near future.

AB  - Cities consume 2/3 of global energy and consequently release a large amount of anthropogenic heat into urban environments, which are already vulnerable to extreme heat risk due to the compounding effects of urban heat island and the warming climate. In this study, we use detailed process-based building energy modeling of over 1.1 million buildings in Los Angeles along with a high-resolution urban micro-climate modeling framework to assess the implications of anthropogenic heating for urban micro-climate dynamics and the feedback process between them. We uniquely distinguish between two major components of anthropogenic heating from HVAC system rejections and exhaust/relief air from buildings. We show that the less-studied anthropogenic heating from building exhaust, compared to that from HVAC systems, is mostly a nocturnal phenomenon with more significant implications for local air temperature due to the lower and more stable planetary boundary layer at night. We demonstrate that anthropogenic heating from HVAC rejection and building exhaust not only have reverse diurnal profiles, they also exhibit offsetting behaviors under increasing outdoor temperatures. Our results show that a detailed understanding of the composition of anthropogenic heating, specific to an urban environment, is required to predict its' diurnal dynamics and its' response to a warming climate.

AB  - Statement of the problem: Demographic and climate changes are the main challenges in the present century. Since the 1970's, the sustainable development and complete inclusive design has been raised as an answer to these challenges. However, the inefficiency of the architectural spaces is still a controversial issue. Although the vernacular architecture has been responsive to the public needs, at the present era, this architecture has been neglected due to not keeping up with the developments of time. Research hypothesis and questions: It seems that by analyzing the universal design and sustainable development key criteria as well as the vernacular architecture resuscitation, we can develop the effective patterns of architecture that can contribute to the universality of spaces and their sustainability. Now, the critical question is arisen that according to the needs of vernacular architecture, which one of the criteria of the inclusive design has the ability to be applied in the sustainable vernacular architecture. Objectives: This is an attempt to identify the convergence or divergence level of the vernacular architecture components and universal design and tries to develop an interactive pattern that is in accordance with the universal design criteria and current ecological needs can be applied in the sustainable vernacular architecture. The research methodology of this paper is a descriptive-analytical and is based on the content analysis technique using qualitative-quantitative mixed approach. That is to say, at first, the architectural interaction pattern in compliance with the criteria of vernacular architecture, complete inclusive design, and sustainable development were developed qualitatively and then the relationships of the key criteria in this pattern and the share of each in the interactive system was determined. In this 4 tidy, the Safavid fence in the district 12 of Tehran was selected as of the research and simultaneously, the qualitative and quantitative data were gathered through a questionnaire. The interactive model we developed based on the qualitative data included six factors as resilience, contextualize, universal usage, comfort, law, and management. Analysis of the quantitative data showed that resilience had the biggest share in the interactive system.

AB  - Numerous studies have examined the factors affecting housing prices and the effects of green building on commercial real estate, but few of them have focused on the effects of acquiring a green building on housing prices. In addition, these studies mostly used the ordinary least squares regression model instead of the more detailed quantile regression model. Given these considerations, this study collected transaction data (2012-2017) on residential buildings in Taiwan's Kaohsiung City to analyze the effects of green building on housing prices. The results showed that common variables such as housing area, number of rooms/parlors/bathrooms, floor number, total number of floors, housing age, and ground/automated parking lots significantly affected housing prices, and there is underestimation or overestimation in different price houses. The prices of green building label and green building candidates were also significantly higher. Moreover, the impact of green buildings on housing prices is higher than that of common variables, and the impact on low- and medium-priced houses is also higher than that of high-priced houses. Therefore, the promotion and marketing of green buildings can be strengthened in future, so that consumers can obtain the benefits that green buildings create on society, the environment, and sustainable development, and they are willing to pay prices for green buildings.

AB  - Historic urban spaces are emplacements that present a particular special interest due to their cultural value and their both urban and architectural pattern. The built environment of cities is composed of a number of variables - anthropic, spatial, morphological, environmental, social, constructive and atmospheric - and all of them must be part of a system that is capable of generating more comfortable and efficient environments. Currently, the work of expert professionals linked to the built environment implies an environmental challenge related to the buildings and their direct harmony with the natural environment; the development of comprehensive plans capable of administering, preserving and protecting historical-heritage constructions in areas susceptible to certain natural disasters; as well as the incorporation of sustainability criteria in urban planning instruments, which is one of the main objectives for regional and state public administrations. This research work intends to propose a comprehensive set of analytical methodologies focused on the morphology of urban blocks, the vitality of the neighbourhood and the functional service life state presented by heritage buildings in order to provide strategies for a proposal for urban regeneration in the case of Barrios Bajos of the city of Valdivia, in southern Chile. This study shows the implications of the proposed methodologies in order to verify their validity and empirically test the application of this type of proposal in one of the historic neighbourhoods of the city of Valdivia, used as a prototype of southern Chile.

AB  - Reducing buildings' operational carbon dioxide emissions has become a crucial element in China's efforts to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets. This study focus on the influence of office building operating characteristics on carbon emissions in cold regions. By utilizing DesignBuilder v7.0.0.096 to conduct numerical simulations of 10 different operating conditions for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems, this study solves the problems in the past of poor comfort and high energy consumption with manual management and achieves a win-win situation for health and environmental protection. The study shows that by implementing a mixed mode of mechanical ventilation and natural ventilation based on outdoor climate conditions and design requirements, unsatisfied hours can be reduced by 202 h compared to the traditional air condition heating operation mode for both winter and summer seasons. Furthermore, compared to a year-round HVAC operation mode, the air-conditioning energy consumption can be reduced by 19%, resulting in a carbon emissions reduction of 1.45 kg CO2/(m2 & BULL;a). Additionally, for every 2 & DEG;C increase in the outdoor temperature, the cooling energy consumption decreases by 2-5%. In terms of lighting, the intelligent lighting mode can reduce energy consumption by 31.04%, leading to a carbon emissions reduction of 3.04 kg CO2/(m2 & BULL;a). The coupling operation characteristics of mixed mode, intelligent lighting, and energy-saving lamps can achieve a maximum saving of 83.46 MWh of electricity and approximately CNY 72,000 every year, with a static payback period of approximately 2.7 years. This operational strategy, which fully considers the utilization of natural ventilation and daylighting in conjunction with traditional design approaches, improves indoor air quality and ventilation conditions, while also maximizing the energy-saving and carbon reduction potential. The study results provide valuable design and operational guidance for new and existing office buildings in cold regions, to effectively reduce carbon emissions, while offering significant investment returns.

AB  - In relation to recent attention focused on the use of energy by lighting, there is a large potential for commercial buildings to save energy in this respect. The use of energy-saving bulbs or dimming controls triggered by daylight, not only enables lighting energy saving, but delivers cooling energy through a reduction in indoor heat production. In this study, we examine the energy use in commercial buildings by evaluating lighting energy saving methods and the effect of using dimmer controls with a heat control method, which can both maximize the cooling load reduction during summer and save energy. Results show that the total energy from the reference commercial building was reduced by 20.9% by replacing LFL T12 bulbs with LEDs, together with an additional saving of 19.9% in cooling energy by using the lighting heat & dimming control method.

AB  - The driving force of super-gentrification shapes a complex system in which multiple dynamic factors interact with each other. This paper takes the dynamic factor system of super-gentrification as the research object and uses the Interpretative Structure Modeling (ISM) to analyze these dynamic factors. The levels of these dynamic factors and the interaction between them are determined. The Cross Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC) analysis is also conducted to determine the dependence power and driving power of these dynamic factors. Through analysis, it is concluded that the dynamic factors of super-gentrification are distributed on six levels. Among these dynamic factors, Transformation of Industrial Structure and Occupational Structure in Urban Central Areas, Housing Needs of Overseas Elites, Investment Needs, Development of the Real Estate Market, and Unique Areas and Lifestyle Preferences are the fundamental dynamic factors affecting super-gentrification. The findings of this paper can enrich the existing theoretical research on the driving force of super-gentrification and can provide a reference for policy makers to promote urban landscape sustainability to some extent.

AB  - In 2011, 644 people passed away after two earthquakes struck the city of Van, located in eastern Turkey. Houses collapsed or were rendered uninhabitable. Thousands of people became homeless. In response, the government built 17 489 units of permanent housing in a standard size and type. This study determined a more effective housing allocation for earthquake victims by considering the types of households (one-person households, one-family households, extended-family households and multi-person, no family households) and the total available housing area as allotted by the government's relief building budget. The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used to prioritize home features for each type of household. These results showed that housing size tailored to household need was more important than price, location or design. Mathematical modeling was then used to identify housing space allocations that would serve family needs better than a uniform building approach.

AB  - The growing energy consumption in the residential sector represents about 30% of global demand. This calls for Demand Side Management solutions propelling change in behaviors of end consumers, with the aim to reduce overall consumption as well as shift it to periods in which demand is lower and where the cost of generating energy is lower. Demand Side Management solutions require detailed knowledge about the patterns of energy consumption. The profile of electricity demand in the residential sector is highly correlated with the time of active occupancy of the dwellings; therefore in this study the occupancy patterns in Spanish properties was determined using the 2009-2010 Time Use Survey (TUS), conducted by the National Statistical Institute of Spain. The survey identifies three peaks in active occupancy, which coincide with morning, noon and evening. This information has been used to input into a stochastic model which generates active occupancy profiles of dwellings, with the aim to simulate domestic electricity consumption. TUS data were also used to identify which appliance-related activities could be considered for Demand Side Management solutions during the three peaks of occupancy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In order to reduce the amount of energy being spent in the construction industry and to achieve the EU Climate and Energy Package goals by 2020, new ways of constructing houses is required. This research proposes construction of bio-based nearly zero energy or passive houses as one solution. Typical house construction methods in the Balkan region are analysed and compared to current Austrian house construction methods (in particular straw bale house built to passive house standards), since Austria is now one of the leading countries in Europe when it comes to offering smart and eco-friendly construction methods. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the environmental performance of straw bale house in the Balkan region, develop the mainstream acceptance and use of straw as a construction material by proving that, such home is not only healthier for the environment, but also economically justifiable to construct than concrete/brick homes usually built in this region of the world. This is done via energy analysis in both BIM and Baubook software and construction cost calculation and comparison of two different house types virtually placed in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a representative country of Balkan region. Type 1 is bio-based house, while Type 2 is concrete house of similar geometry. During the analysis, it was discovered that Type 1 house is in compliance with passive house standards, while Type 2 isn't. Furthermore, energy use intensity according to BIM analysis for Type I is half of the value of the Type 2 house. Peak heating load for Type 2 house is much larger than for the Type 1 house. Global warming potential of Type 1 house is negative, which means that bio-based materials absorb CO2 during its life. Global warming potential for Type 2 is 435.02 kgCO(2)/m(2). In addition to this, it costs slightly less to construct Type 1 - house than Type 2 house. Therefore, this paper proves that Type 1 - Bio-based house is cheaper to construct and more energy efficient than Type 2 - Concrete house that is typically being constructed in the Balkan region.

AB  - In the European context of moving to a low-carbon economy, knowledge regarding household decisions surrounding residential heating systems is crucial for policymakers in order to design effective policies both to reduce non-renewable energy consumption and to enhance energy efficiency in the residential sector. The choices made by households concerning decisions on how to heat their homes can significantly influence the related environmental impacts. This research examines two aspects of decision making with respect to heating system upgrades in Italian households using, for the first time, data from the 2013 Italian Households Energy Consumption survey: the choice of using renewable energies for space heating and decision to invest in energy efficient retrofits. Our findings show that household socio-economic characteristics and contextual factors are critical for good decision-making regarding heating system. We also find that previous cash retrofit investments and dwelling characteristics are important determining factors both for the choice of heating system based on renewable sources and for the subsequent decision regarding the adoption of energy efficient retrofit measures.

AB  - Information about rapidly changing slum areas may support the development of appropriate interventions by concerned authorities. Often, however, traditional data collection methods lack information on the spatial distribution of slum-dwellers. Remote sensing based methods could be used for a rapid inventory of the location and physical composition of slums. (Semi-)automatic detection of slums in image data is challenging, owing to the high variability in appearance and definitions across different contexts. This paper develops an ontological framework to conceptualize slums using input from 50 domain-experts covering 16 different countries. This generic slum ontology (GSO) comprises concepts identified at three levels that refer to the morphology of the built environment: the environs level, the settlement level and the object level. It serves as a comprehensive basis for image-based classification of slums, in particular, using object-oriented image analysis (OOA) techniques. This is demonstrated by with an example of local adaptation of GSO and OOA parameterization for a study area in Kisumu, Kenya. At the object level, building and road characteristics are major components of the ontology. At the settlement level, texture measures can be potentially used to represent the contrast between planned and unplanned settlements. At the environs level, factors which extend beyond the site itself are important indicators, e.g. hazards due to floods plains and marshy conditions. The GSO provides a comprehensive framework that includes all potentially relevant indicators that can be used for image-based slum identification. These characteristics may be different for other study areas, but show the applicability of the developed framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate the behaviour of building users and how this impacts upon building energy performance. Specifically, the work examines the behavioural traits of able-bodied users of a large higher education building who erroneously access and egress the building using doorways intended for disabled users. Design/methodology/approach An inductive methodological approach is adopted that uses grounded theory to devise new insights into building users' access and egress habits. Structured interviews are conducted to collect primary data from 68 building users of a large educational building over a four-week period. Responses to questions posed provide the basis for a tabularisation of behavioural traits. Findings Reasons for able-bodied building users' preferences to using disabled access are identified and discussed; these are thematically grouped under the headings of apathy, convenience, emergency, ergonomics, ignorance and phobia. Building upon these findings, the research then offers insights into the approaches that could be adopted to change the erroneous behaviours. These approaches include education of building users on the impact their behaviour has upon building performance and environmental pollution, more stringent regulation to penalise repeat offenders and changes to building entrance design using obtrusive (i.e. radio frequency identification tags) and unobstrusive control measures (i.e. a second entrance doorway or slower opening mechanism). Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to investigate the rationale for able-bodied building users erroneously using disabled persons' access and egress doorways within a building, which as a consequence, inadvertently reduces the building's environmental performance.

AB  - Assessment of the embodied energy associated with the production and transportation of materials during the design phase of building provides great potential to profoundly affect the building's energy use and sustainability performance. While Building Information Modeling (BIM) gives opportunities to incorporate sustainability performance indicators in the building design process, it lacks interoperability with the conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools used to analyse the environmental footprints of materials in building design. Additionally, many LCA tools use databases based on industry-average values and thus cannot account for differences in the embodied impacts of specific materials from individual suppliers. To address these issues, this paper presents a framework that supports design decisions and enables assessment of the embodied energy associated with building materials supply chain based on suppliers' Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). The framework also integrates Extract Transform Load (ETL) technology into the BIM to ensure BIM-LCA interoperability, enabling an automated or semi-automated assessment process. The applicability of the framework is tested by developing a prototype and using it in a case study, which shows that a building's energy use and carbon footprint can be significantly reduced during the design phase by accounting the impact of individual material in the supply chain.

AB  - In the context of sustainable densification of post-industrial European cities, regeneration of disused urban areas offer an important potential of surfaces to recapture. Indeed, these projects can contribute concurrently to densify and revitalize existing built fabrics. Although numerous initiatives of this type can be observed, the integration of sustainability issues is in most cases partial or superficial. As a matter of fact, achieving the goals of sustainable development is not a spontaneous process. It depends upon a proactive search of global quality, integrated into the project dynamics, and a continuous assessment of the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability adapted to the specificities of such projects. Based on these considerations, this paper introduces the indicator system entitled SIPRIUS, designed for the assessment of sustainability integrated into the project dynamics of regeneration of disused urban areas. First, the methodology that stands behind the development of SIPRIUS is exposed. Then, the paper presents the potential of SIPRIUS and its adequacy with concrete situations through a test application performed on a project underway in Neuchatel (Switzerland). It reveals that an adapted and structured assessment approach truly contributes to integrating sustainability into regeneration of disused urban areas. Furthermore, future work will include the adaptation of SIPRIUS into a digital monitoring tool in order to make it accessible to key stakeholders involved in this type of operations.

AB  - Residential energy use has become an important source of global energy demand growth and carbon emissions growth. Residential building energy usage accounts for about 22% of the total energy use in the United States. In the current study, we address residential energy usage by addressing two decisions: (1) source of energy (such as electric and natural gas) and (2) consumption by energy source for various purposes. A Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value model that allows us to analyze the source and consumption decisions in an integrated framework is developed. The model is estimated using data drawn from the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey that provides energy use details for electricity, natural gas, fuel oil and Liquefied Petroleum Gas for residential units across United States. An exhaustive set of independent variables including location characteristics, household characteristics, housing characteristics, appliance use and climatic characteristics were employed in the model estimation. The model estimation results are augmented with a comprehensive policy analysis to illustrate how various independent variables affect energy use by source. A comparison of energy use between urban and rural regions, by varying household size and housing unit size are examined. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional living spaces contain climatic and cultural elements that may be used in the design of future living spaces. The sustainable characteristics that have been developed by trial and error for hundreds of years can be reinterpreted in contemporary architecture according to modern conditions. In this study, user satisfaction levels have been examined in the new living spaces in Sanliurfa, a city located in southeastern Turkey. The design of the mass housing settlement examined within the scope of this study was inspired by traditional living spaces. It has been shown that, contrary to expectations, the similarities between the modern and traditional living spaces are not always accepted by today's users. In this study, users reflected that they would be more satisfied if there were some changes in the design of their houses terms of spatial organization. They also raised some concerns about the setting and characteristics of the settlement.

AB  - Planning for housing in Britain has embraced the use of housing market areas (HMAs) as appropriate geographies to address calls for greater market responsiveness. Tenure is a crucial dimension of the housing market, so it must be central to assessing local housing demands. Despite the wide cleavages between social and private rented sectors, and between both of these sectors and the owner-occupying majority, the geography of tenure-specific HMAs has remained largely unexplored. This paper assesses the importance of tenure-specific HMAs for housing planning within the current policy frameworks aimed at meeting housing needs. The paper then reports analyses to delineate tenure-specific HMAs, with these boundaries then compared with HMAs defined by analysing the whole market. The case for a national system of tenure-specific HMAs based on migration is found to be unproven. Nevertheless, such HMAs can provide the basis for meaningful affordability measures and a tool to address segregation and reshape housing markets in cities.

AB  - Underlying trends of long-term summer and winter discomfort in terms of heat and cold stresses in the nine major thermal climate zones and sub-zones across China were investigated using 102-year (1901-2002) weather data. In severe cold climates, winter discomfort dominated (about 66%) and the comfort index (CI) varied from -5 (extremely cold) to +2 (hot). A gradual shift from predominantly negative CI to positive CI was observed as one moved across the climate zones from the north to warmer climates in the south. Temperature rise resulted in less discomfort in the winter and more discomfort in the summer. Though the reduction in cold stress and increase in heat stress were moderate during the 102-year period, the last two decades tended to exhibit the largest changes. It is envisaged that if these trends continue, changes in cold and heat stresses in the 21st century would be much greater than those experienced during the 20th century. This could have significant implications for building designs and energy use in the built environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studentification-the concentration of students within a particular neighbourhood and associated impacts-represents a "generationed" or age-segregated housing submarket defined by a distinct life course stage. I analyse this submarket through the lens of David Harvey's concept of class monopoly rent, a critical theory of residential submarkets, drawing on semi-structured interviews with key informants and students in Waterloo-Canada's largest private purpose-built student accommodation market. Planning interventions, real estate strategies, and neighbourhood politics have intertwined to enable the extraction of class monopoly rent from a clearly delineated student housing submarket. I show how studentification, and the age segregation it entails, is produced by and serves to reproduce capitalist urbanisation, illustrating temporal power dynamics of rent. A radical political response to the impacts of studentification on students and other residents alike must therefore adopt an intergenerational perspective that confronts class and life course dimensions of the process simultaneously.

AB  - The paper attempts to ascertain the impact of age segregation on the quality of life of the elderly who are living in high-rise studio apartments in Singapore. After a review of the relevant literature and statistical analysis of a survey data for 390 elderly respondents in high-rise studio apartments, it was found that age segregation have a deleterious impact on the quality of life of the elderly. Furthermore, it was found that the perception of the elderly in relation to factors that are most significant to their quality of life is at variance with that of the policy makers. This implies that there is a need for policy makers and service providers to review their existing policies, products and services so as to be more effective in providing housing options for the rapidly aging population of Singapore. Although the elderly are comfortable with high-rise living, super high-rise living may cause affordability and safety concern.

AB  - While the housing markets in the western world suffer from problems centring around falling demand and negative equities, Hong Kong stands in stark contrast to this development. Rising affluence and conflicting government policy have led to a phenomenal growth in house prices and a general increase in home ownership. This situation has triggered off two different but related social processes. First, home ownership has created substantial wealth and life chances for established home owners and there are indications that social division is being gradually restructured. Second, the same process has also residualised a sector of the middle class-classified as the 'sandwich class' in Hong Kong-who are trapped in the housing system because of an affordability problem. This paper attempts to trace (1) the genesis of this middle class housing crisis through an examination of house price inflation and the growth of owner-occupation for the last two decades; and (2) the contradictions within the present housing policy which contribute towards the current housing crisis. It is argued that housing research should take special note of the restrictive nature of housing systems such as in Hong Kong where over population and shortage of land could severely limit policy choice.

AB  - As a result of changes to the financial regime for housing associations, affordability has become a major issue of debate in social rented housing in Britain. This paper assesses the implications of trying to construct a finance system for housing associations based on a regime of 'affordable rents' and the 'safety net' of Housing Benefits but with the state declining to define the central concept of affordability. Using examples of a number of Western countries, and empirical evidence from the sector in Scotland, the present position is criticised, and a route out of the policy vacuum is suggested. This is founded on the premise that housing is a means rather than an end, within a broader social policy. Given the political constraints, one solution lies in studies of the expenditure patterns and standards of living of different groups of housing association tenants, and in the creation of a sector-specific organisational subsidy to be available in addition to the usual producer- and consumer-subsidies.

AB  - In post-Katrina New Orleans, housing and community development (HCD) advocates clashed over the future of public housing. This case study examines the evolution of and limits to a human right to housing frame introduced by one non-governmental organization (NGO). Ferree's concept of the discursive opportunity structure and Bourdieu's social field ground this NGO's failure to advance a radical economic human rights frame, given its choice of a political inside strategy that opened up for HCD NGOs after Hurricane Katrina. Strategic and ideological differences within the field limited the efficacy of this rights-based frame, which was seen as politically radical and risky compared with more resonant frames for seeking affordable housing resources and development opportunities. These divides flowed from the position of the movement-born HCD field within a neoliberal political economy, especially its current institutionalization in the finance and real estate sector, and its dependence on the state for funding and political legitimacy.

AB  - The current climate change emergency has triggered a global strive for reducing carbon emissions and relevant sustainable planning for low-carbon cities. The adaptive reuse of existing buildings can be adopted to facilitate climate change mitigation progressively. This study explores the applicability of the adaptive reuse concept as a sustainable tool for climate change mitigation.Data was gathered using the systematic literature review (SLR) approach embedded in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol and key informant interviews with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).From the SLR results, 29 benefits and 16 challenges of the adaptive reuse of existing buildings were identified under four main categories each (i.e., for benefits: economic, social, cultural and historical, and environmental; and for challenges: building regulatory requirements and governance, financial, management, and complexities and uncertainties). The interview findings revealed the influence of the identified benefits and challenges, with strategies which were examined to propose a conceptual framework. The framework aims to guide relevant stakeholders on how the adaptive reuse of existing buildings could be used as a practical, sustainable measure to achieve climate change mitigation in the built environment.

AB  - Turkish vernacular housing architecture is in danger of extinction. Original village patterns deteriorate due to new developments, which are discordant with existing settlements and social lifestyle. This paper claims to ensure the cultural continuity of Turkish vernacular housing architecture by adapting new residential designs to the existent environment with a parametric shape grammar method. Originally, vernacular house plans included the allocation of space around a hall: a Sofa. This study firstly exposes spatial organization and grammar rule sets according to the relation between the sofa and remaining spaces, secondly considers current physical problems and villagers' contemporary living demands and finally creates design solutions coherent with the actual vernacular character by adapting a new design grammar to the existing design.

AB  - This paper examines the processes of transformation of the architecture and spatial character of a Nigerian city, in the planning and delivery of a sustainable built environment. It examines the inter-dependency or relationship between the traditional market space and the city which is constantly being challenged, adapted and simultaneously undermined by the city's rapid growth and modernisation. Therefore, the meanings attached to the market and its built environment has not only changed on several levels from the symbolic, sacred, religious use to commercial and mundane one but also has taken on new spatial forms in sustaining the life of the city due to the activities of the various actors which is predicated on their worldview. The paper provides a detailed examination of the geographical location of the old market built environment, in relation to the expansion of the city over time. It traces historical changes in the surrounding urban-scape of the market, in particular, the location of developments, many originating from the colonial period, and their impact on the life of the market over time. It relates, how these historical relationships are registered both topographically and spatially providing supporting visual material such as maps and developmental plans. This paper further expatiates on the understanding of negotiation and conflict that ensued during the interaction within the material environment of the city through the prism of the role of actors (government officials, users, planners, politicians) involved with the built marketplace in the study area. Analyses provided through interpretive anthropology which is synchronic in nature (focus at events in a slice of time) and those provided by Actor-Network Theory (ANT) that is diachronic (focus on dynamic events through time), i.e. anthropology focuses more on the "static" past whereas ANT focuses on the activities of the actants in "dynamic" or "real-time". The paper concludes that theoretical and cultural interpretation impacts the physical marketplace, its form, character, and spatiality; this must itself be understood as an agent or actant in the struggle, in as much as it both enables and constrains human activities.

AB  - This paper reaffirms the importance of politics in theories on gentrification through analysis of a recent 'regeneration' project based in Craigmillar, a stigmatised district on the southeastern edge of Edinburgh. It sketches the historical backdrop to the area's stigma as a place 'outside' the city, using qualitative research on the Craigmillar Festival Society to highlight how this stigma was produced and intensified as well as contested. By stressing that the main intention of the 'regeneration' project was to attract more affluent residents to Craigmillar, we show how territorial stigmatisation and 'regeneration' through gentrification form two sides of the same conceptual and policy coin: the "blemish of place" becomes a target and rationale for 'fixing' the area, thus obviating and obstructing policies aimed at attacking deprivation, inequality, or the structural problems of advanced marginality. The state's role in creating the very stigma it then insists on scrubbing highlights a major contradiction in contemporary urban policy.

AB  - Global changes in climate are urging today's societies to reduce the impact of human activities on ecosystems. Ecological awareness has also reached architecture, where the notion of an ecological building is relative and intricately linked to the context and the means, both material and human. The analysis of the trajectory of the architects TYIN Tegnestue, from their beginnings when they were still students until their recent dissolution, can be taken as a critical index to evaluate where ecological practice in architecture stands. This text studies their work to show the features, patterns, and values related to ecology and participatory design. It shows the growing attention that other architects receive about understanding the project and the construction as vehicles of social cohesion and ecology.

AB  - Background Globally, almost 1.6 billion individuals lack adequate housing. Many accommodation-based approaches have evolved across the globe to incorporate additional support and services beyond delivery of housing. Objectives This review examines the effectiveness of accommodation-based approaches on outcomes including housing stability, health, employment, crime, wellbeing, and cost for individuals experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness. Search Methods The systematic review is based on evidence already identified in two existing EGMs commissioned by the Centre for Homelessness Impact (CHI) and built by White et al. The maps were constructed using a comprehensive three stage search and mapping process. Stage one mapped included studies in an existing systematic review on homelessness, stage two was an extensive search of 17 academic databases, three EGM databases, and eight systematic review databases. Finally stage three included web searches for grey literature, scanning reference lists of included studies and consultation with experts to identify additional literature. We identified 223 unique studies across 551 articles from the effectiveness map on 12th April 2019. Selection Criteria We include research on all individuals currently experiencing, or at risk of experiencing homelessness irrespective of age or gender, in high-income countries. The Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) contains all study designs where a comparison group was used. This includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental designs, matched comparisons and other study designs that attempt to isolate the impact of the intervention on homelessness. The NMA primarily addresses how interventions can reduce homelessness and increase housing stability for those individuals experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, homelessness. Additional outcomes are examined and narratively described. These include: access to mainstream healthcare; crime and justice; employment and income; capabilities and wellbeing; and cost of intervention. These outcomes reflect the domains used in the EGM, with the addition of cost. Data Collection and Analysis Due to the diverse nature of the literature on accommodation-based approaches, the way in which the approaches are implemented in practice, and the disordered descriptions of the categories, the review team created a novel typology to allow meaningful categorisations for functional and useful comparison between the various intervention types. Once these eligible categories were identified, we undertook dual data extraction, where two authors completed data extraction and risk of bias (ROB) assessments independently for each study. NMA was conducted across outcomes related to housing stability and health.Qualitative data from process evaluations is included using a "Best Fit" Framework synthesis. The purpose of this synthesis is to complement the quantitative evidence and provide a better understanding of what factors influenced programme effectiveness. All included Qualitative data followed the initial framework provided by the five main analytical categories of factors of influence (reflected in the EGM), namely: contextual factors, policy makers/funders, programme administrators/managers/implementing agencies, staff/case workers and recipients of the programme. Main Results There was a total of 13,128 people included in the review, across 51 reports of 28 studies. Most of the included studies were carried out in the United States of America (25/28), with other locations including Canada and the UK. Sixteen studies were RCTs (57%) and 12 were nonrandomised (quasi-experimental) designs (43%). Assessment of methodological quality and potential for bias was conducted using the second version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for Randomised controlled trials. Nonrandomised studies were coded using the ROBINS- I tool. Out of the 28 studies, three had sufficiently low ROB (11%), 11 (39%) had moderate ROB, and five (18%) presented serious problems with ROB, and nine (32%) demonstrated high, critical problems with their methodology. A NMA on housing stability outcomes demonstrates that interventions offering the highest levels of support alongside unconditional accommodation (High/Unconditional) were more effective in improving housing stability compared to basic support alongside unconditional housing (Basic/Unconditional) (ES=1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.39, 1.82]), and in comparison to a no-intervention control group (ES=0.62, 95% CI [0.19, 1.06]). A second NMA on health outcomes demonstrates that interventions categorised as offering Moderate/Conditional (ES= 0.36, 95% CI [0.03, 0.69]) and High/Unconditional (ES = 0.22, 95% CI [0.01, 0.43]) support were effective in improving health outcomes compared to no intervention. These effects were smaller than those observed for housing stability. The quality of the evidence was relatively low but varied across the 28 included studies. Depending on the context, finding accommodation for those who need it can be hindered by supply and affordability in the market. The social welfare approach in each jurisdiction can impact heavily on support available and can influence some of the prejudice and stigma surrounding homelessness. The evaluations emphasised the need for collaboration and a shared commitment between policymakers, funders and practitioners which creates community and buy in across sectors and agencies. However, co-ordinating this is difficult and requires sustainability to work. For those implementing programmes, it was important to invest time in developing a culture together to build trust and solid relationships. Additionally, identifying sufficient resources and appropriate referral routes allows for better implementation planning. Involving staff and case workers in creating processes helps drive enthusiasm and energy for the service. Time should be allocated for staff to develop key skills and communicate engage effectively with service users. Finally, staff need time to develop trust and relationships with service users; this goes hand in hand with providing information that is up to date and useful as well making themselves accessible in terms of location and time. Authors' Conclusions The network meta-analysis suggests that all types of accommodation which provided support are more effective than no intervention or Basic/Unconditional accommodation in terms of housing stability and health. The qualitative evidence synthesis raised a primary issue in relation to context: which was the lack of stable, affordable accommodation and the variability in the rental market, such that actually sourcing accommodation to provide for individuals who are homeless is extremely challenging. Collaboration between stakeholders and practitioners can be fruitful but difficult to coordinate across different agencies and organisations.

AB  - In this paper, we build on a long research effort aimed at identifying the specific conditions, functional and structural characteristics of urban areas, that produce different levels of residential segregation across cities. We explore segregation levels in Poland's 87 largest cities, cities with more than 50,000 residents, by measuring indices of dissimilarity relating to socio-professional status. We then proceed by examining core structural determinants of the revealed segregation levels, including city size, and housing market characteristics. The results suggests that the structural characteristics of urban regions are indeed significant predictors of the level of socio-spatial disparities in urban Poland. As expected, larger cities are more segregated than the smaller ones; higher shares of public housing also appear to contribute to more pronounced socioeconomic spatial divisions. Intriguingly, the share of new housing stock alone is not related to strong residential segregation.

AB  - The authorities of cities in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are struggling to contain urban sprawl. The region's rapid population growth is expected to exacerbate the situation. Diagnoses of the problem identify rapid population growth, improved transportation network and surface condition, improved utility service distribution and high household incomes as the combination of factors that drive urban sprawl although the drivers are not the same across all regions and within countries. Scholars observe that the nuclearisation of the family system in Ghana creates a need for more houses and living spaces. Given this context, the proposition of current study is that the nuclearisation of the family system in urban Ghana is a major driver of urban sprawl. Accordingly, a comparative case study research design was adopted to assess the effects of family nuclearisation on sprawl. Data were ob-tained by interviewing 236 household heads from three carefully selected settlements in Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city. Housing density data were also obtained from satellite images. The data analysis revealed that the dominant compound housing vernacular of the 19th -20th Centuries in Ghana was informed by the need to accommodate extended family members. However, in the 21st Century, the nuclear family system has usurped the influence of the extended family system on housing supply. Desirous of privacy, pristine environmental conditions and low-cost land, the nuclear family members acquire land at the peripheries of the cities for the construction of low-density housing. Their affinity for low-density housing units expands the boundaries of the cities, which the satellite images confirmed. The overall implication is that the nuclearisation of families in Kumasi is an important driver for urban sprawl. The paper concludes with recommendations for addressing these intractable urban planning issues.

AB  - In this article, the authors unveil the social context surrounding a publicly funded project to improve the extremely poor housing conditions of a Roma community in Poland. The focus was on one Carpathian mountain village in which a Bergitka Roma settlement has existed for more than 80 years. A brand-new apartment house for the local Roma minority partly replaced the earlier settlement in a village populated by Gorale, a highlander group that is the local majority. At present about 70 Roma live in the new building. The ethnographic material was obtained during fieldwork carried out in 1994-2017. Herein the authors reconstruct the most significant moments in this investment from different points of view: the Roma and non-Roma neighbors. Each side interprets the fact in its own, rather paradoxical manner; each side has learned different new things in the process. The ambitious housing policy undoubtedly led to improvement of the Roma standard of living; it did not, however, increase the extent of their integration. The natural geology as well as manmade elements (e.g. a fence and a bridge) create and maintain boundaries. Nevertheless, analysis of the broader social context is decidedly more crucial than an analysis of facts. Ultimately, the sense of such publicly funded housing projects needs to be scrutinized from the diverse perspectives within the local community.

AB  - Energy-efficient and sustainable building management has always been a key concern surrounding buildings. The rise of environmental and social concern in today's world has brought more attention to the issue of sustainable and smart building management. This paper aims to review the state-of-the-art research and performance on building management that aims to make more sustainable and energy-efficient decisions. This paper classifies building management based on technologies utilized for management and different aspects of management that should be considered when regarding the larger picture of "sustainability". Additionally, while keeping in mind that long-term sustainability cannot be achieved through energy management alone, this research investigates previous works that also mention diverse aspects that must be taken into consideration when creating a truly successful smart building environment: costs, occupant comfort, and security. Of course, each field deserves an extensive analysis, but the purpose of this review paper is to deliver current research that has brought attention to the rapidly shifting and developing field of smart buildings to provide a macro-level holistic viewpoint on how smart buildings and homes should be approached from a sustainability viewpoint.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the factors that influence heating energy consumption in residential apartments using smart meter data and surveys. It emphasized the significance of residents' behavior as a key variable. The analysis considered physical and behavioral factors, including external factors, building characteristics, resident demographics, and residents' heating energy consumption behavior. Based on these factors, a model for heating energy consumption was developed. Moreover, the study found that residents' heating energy consumption behavior had a strong explanatory power in both space heating and hot water energy consumption models. Therefore, to achieve accurate prediction and evaluation of energy consumption in the residential sector, future research should thoroughly consider resident characteristics and energy use behavior, taking into account different types of final energy. Furthermore, it is crucial to comprehensively consider residents' characteristics when developing energy-saving policies for buildings, as this will lead to meaningful outcomes.

AB  - The built environment, as perceived and felt by human beings, can shape and affect residential satisfaction. From the perspective of municipal administrators, understanding the building environment and its relationship with people's residential satisfaction is crucial to improving people's living environment. This study examines the correlation between built environment elements and residential satisfaction using the consideration of spatial heterogeneity of such a correlation. Machine vision technology is introduced to quantify the design dimension of the built environment. The method of multiscale geographically weighted regression is used to evaluate the relationship between built environment and residential satisfaction and to analyze the spatial heterogeneity in the influencing effects. This empirical study draws on 399 collected samples from the residents of Zhengzhou, China. The results show that elements of the built environment, including street space design features, have a significant effect on people's residential satisfaction in Zhengzhou City. The factors of functional diversity and distance to the city center show spatial heterogeneity in influencing effects on residential satisfaction. The results of this study could help municipal managers to improve people's residential satisfaction in Zhengzhou City through the development of urban renewal policies.

AB  - Globally, about 20-30% of total energy demand is for residential use. Yet, our understanding of household energy consumption remains obscure. Due to methodological issues, conventional residential energy research has often failed to untangle the complexities of household energy use. In addition, theoretical deficiencies have led to underestimation of the complexities of households' role (vs. buildings' role) in residential energy use processes. This research hypothesizes that households have an indirect effect on energy use - through their housing choice behaviors - that can be untangled from buildings' effect. Using data from the latest Residential Energy Consumption Survey, this paper develops a Structural Equation Model to estimate the direct, indirect, and total effects of household and housing characteristics on percapita residential energy use in the U.S. Outcomes support the research hypothesis and recommend that, when incorporating the housing choice effect, households' overall effect on energy use is larger than what has been perceived conventionally. Findings of this study provide a new approach to understanding residential energy use by highlighting the role of households and their housing choices in shaping residential energy consumption patterns. Policy makers can incorporate housing policy into energy policy and reduce residential energy consumption more effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Occupancy patterns that describe occupant presence or absence can result in a significant impact in energy use of residential buildings; thus, they are critical to the energy modeling of residential buildings. Occupancy patterns currently embedded in building energy simulation tools or recommended in the standards are uniform, ignoring that different occupancy patterns exist for households with different socio-demographic characteristics. Consequently, this study objective is to extract the typical occupancy patterns of households and quantify the correlations between household occupancy patterns and socio-demographic characteristics based on statistical approaches. Clustering analysis was used to identify rep-resentative types of occupancy patterns based on the occupancy profiles of daily occupant presence data. Then, correlations between occupancy patterns and household characteristics were identified by investi-gating three statistical methods: nonparametric analysis, decision trees, and association rule mining. To illustrate the quantitative analysis, datasets collected by a large-scale questionnaire survey in two Chinese cities were used for the case study. The results revealed that socio-demographic characteristics, such as occupant age, employment status and household composition, have statistically significantly associated with occupancy patterns. The statistical quantitative analysis can be used to estimate house-hold occupancy patterns to further reduce the performance gap between the simulation and actual energy consumption of residential buildings.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study explores the collective settings of Hallenwohnen (hall dwelling) as a section of the Zollhaus settlement, which is the follow-up project by the Kalkbreite housing cooperative, functioning since January 2021 in Zurich, Switzerland. Hallenwohnen is the first legal hall cohousing arrangement in Switzerland. The private and semiprivate spaces of Hallenwohnen consist of a large open hall with collective basic structures and mobile residential towers (rollable spaces) as the core concept, which offer an affordable, self-managed/self-build, collaborative living and coworking arrangement in the center of Zurich. The qualitative case study method has been applied through the face-to-face semistructured interviews mainly with three occupants of Hallenwohnen as representatives of this residential community, in-situ observations, spatial investigations and document analyses. The theoretical framework of the study is grounded in the concept of collaborative housing. The results reveal that the innovative socio-spatial potentials of the collective spaces have been activated through the participatory intentions of the microcommunity and intended functional mix of the setting. Living as one collective household , multiplicity usage of hybrid spaces and the spatial activation of intermediate spaces have enabled participation-capable residential spaces and have resulted in optimal usage of housing spaces. Nonetheless, constraints and points of conflicts, which trigger the (re)negotiations and reinterpretations of the usage of collective housing spaces facilitate collective solutions of the residential community. A bottom-up initiative such as Hallenwohnen is helped along, through the long-term planning and top-down support of the cooperative housing model of Zurich.

AB  - Designers can use natural ventilation to reduce building energy use and improve occupant comfort. This study aims to provide guidance for designers of naturally ventilated buildings on the impact various design parameters have on natural ventilation performance. We modelled a naturally ventilated reference office building, under a range of climate conditions and ventilation strategies. We performed a sensitivity analysis of a range of unknown design parameters used in the early design stage. The results underline the most important parameters and their effect on natural ventilation strategies in different climate types. Of the parameters assessed, airflow network parameters had the most significant impact on improve thermal comfort. Envelope characteristics were found to have a significant impact also on night cooling strategies in climates with large diurnal swing. The results showed a dominant influence of the parameters that directly impact solar and internal gains on natural ventilation performance. Quantitative measures of the impact of various input parameters are presented here which, with the use of dynamic building simulation, can be used to support natural ventilation design.

AB  - Energy flexibility of buildings can be an essential resource for a sustainable and reliable power grid with the growing variable renewable energy shares and the trend to electrify and decarbonize buildings. Traditional demand-side management technologies, advanced building controls, and emerging distributed energy resources (including electric vehicle, energy storage, and on-site power generation) enable the transition of the building stock to grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) that operate efficiently to meet service needs and are responsive to grid pricing or carbon signals to achieve energy and carbon neutrality. Although energy flexibility has received growing attention from industry and the research community, there remains a lack of common ground for energy flexibility terminologies, characterization, and quantification methods. This paper presents a semantic ontology-EFOnt (Energy Flexibility Ontology)-that extends existing terminologies, ontologies, and schemas for building energy flexibility applications. EFOnt aims to serve as a standardized tool for knowledge co-development and streamlining energy flexibility related applications. We demonstrate potential use cases of EFOnt via two examples: (1) energy flexibility analytics with measured data from a residential smart thermostat dataset and a commercial building, and (2) modeling and simulation to evaluate energy flexibility of buildings. The compatibility of EFOnt with existing ontologies and the outlook of EFOnt's role in the building energy data tool ecosystem are discussed.

AB  - Adaptive reuse of buildings plays a key role in the transition from a resource-based economy and towards a Circular Economy (CE) in the construction industry. Adaptive reuse has the potential to maximize the residual utility and value of existing assets through green design methods such as selective disassembly planning. Studies in the field of selective disassembly are scarce and there is no evidence of established methodologies for the optimization of the environmental and financial benefits. A multi-objective analysis is key to obtaining several effective selective disassembly plans for the adaptive reuse of an existing asset through the combination of different deconstruction methods. The analysis is carried out in terms of the physical, environmental, and economic constraints of the deconstruction methods per building component. The Sequential Disassembly Planning for Buildings (SDPB) method is used in order to generate the optimized disassembly plans for retrieving target components. At the end, a weighted multi-objective optimization analysis is incorporated to generate the set of noninferior solutions that minimizes environmental impacts and building cost. The results show that different complete disassembly plans exist for all the possible combinations. The possible combinations are driven by the deconstruction methods per component, as well as the dismantling interdependence. The method described in this study can be used to improve the project outcomes according to specific goals and constraints (e.g. environmental, economic, technical). The results of this study improve the decision-making process for adaptive reuse building projects by adding comprehensive quantitative analysis towards sustainable management and conservation of resources.

AB  - In order to reach the climate goals set by the Paris Agreement and similar such ambitions, energy consumption in the residential sector must be addressed. Space conditioning is responsible for the majority of the energy used, and has thus become a focal point for building energy codes and voluntary building standards. Passive House is one such standard. Their design philosophy is to build tight and ventilate right. By making highly insulated and airtight homes, there is very little heat loss, which subsequently reduces the energy consumption by up to 90%. The prime market for energy reduction ought to be existing buildings and historic buildings (older than 50 years). These buildings are the least energy efficient, and are projected to make up the majority of buildings in the future. Reducing the energy consumption in the existing building sector through deep energy retrofits is necessary for meeting the aforementioned climate goals. Despite their pivotal role in energy reduction, retrofits are still too few. Previous work has identified barriers to retrofitting as the lack of knowledge, the lack of regulation, and the financial challenges present with such a project. In order to understand how these problems evolved, case studies were collected and analyzed. It was found that lack of knowledge had shifted from technical problems regarding whether or not Passive House retrofits are feasible, to more nuanced research, such as the optimization of specific traits. Regulation has developed, with more codes and government support for energy conservation measures in general, but the retrofit market specifically could benefit from more specialized attention. The financial challenges are, have been, and will continue to plague retrofit projects. This problem is partially addressed through increasing knowledge and incentives, but it will never truly go away. The best so-lution is, in addition to increased affordability, that stakeholders begin to value the energy reduction thereby making the costs seem worth it. The overarching theme of the most recent research focuses on not doing just something, but doing the right thing. Optimization studies and holistic design approaches are starting to dominate the field, and financial analysis is no longer the dominating metric. What exactly the "right" solutions are will be a matter of research and debate for years to come.

AB  - Two significant manifestations of the passive effect of building photovoltaic (PV) systems include the enhancement of the thermal performance of the envelope and the reduction of building energy consumption through the installation of PV systems on the building envelope's surface. This paper presents a review of the passive impact of PV roof systems, PV wall systems, and PV window systems, as well as the effects of the external environment, building ontology conditions, and PV system configuration on the passive effects. The study concludes that in regions with a hot climate, the shading effect of PV roof and PV wall systems during the summer can reduce the building's cooling load by 20% to 70%. In frigid climate regions, heating energy consumption during the winter can be reduced by 10% to 20% through the PV wall system's ability to recycle hot air in the cavity. Indoor thermal comfort can be improved while reducing lighting energy consumption by 3% to 14% with PV windows. A comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on the influencing factors reveals that the influencing factors of the passive effect have complex uncertainties and non-linear coupling characteristics under various conditions. To provide a theoretical foundation for the scientific popularization of photovoltaic systems, this paper identifies current research problems and prospective research directions for building photovoltaic systems based on the current status of research in the literature.

AB  - Three main groups of internal and external influencing factors have been identified through this review, including building characteristics, equipment and technologies, and occupant's behaviors. The consideration of only building characteristics cannot guarantee the best energy design of a building, as it could be dependent on the other two groups of factors. Under some circumstances, some of the energy efficiency design solutions did not consider economic or environmental benefits. A wide range of advanced technologies is available for building designers, while challenges still exist from a cost-effectiveness perspective. Many numerical results are hard to validate and confirm the feasibility of those real projects. Comparatively, occupant behavior interventions provide an alternative solution for building users to improve energy efficiency with a relatively low cost and unsophisticated construction procedures. According to those reviewed studies, the ranges of energy-saving are 10-28% and 43-71% through the smart control of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and the lighting systems, respectively. The trends of key influencing factors on energy efficiency design have slightly changed over the past few decades. The influencing factors had been mainly investigated in the optimization design and technological updates of buildings previously but now have incorporated the building management of occupant behavior. Few studies have been carried out to integrate the occupant behavior model into the current energy simulation software. Thus, two research directions can be concluded after this review. Building efficiency design needs to be conducted from a systematic view to figure out the underlying issues among different efficient design measures. Energy performance benchmarking of both occupant behavior interventions and the technological updates and building service systems are urgently needed as a guided reference to help the building users to make smart decisions.

AB  - Objective No previous experimental trials have investigated Housing First (HF) in both scattered site (SHF) and congregate (CHF) formats. We hypothesized that CHF and SHF would be associated with a greater percentage of time stably housed as well as superior health and psychosocial outcomes over 24 months compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Methods Inclusion criteria were homelessness, mental illness, and high need for support. Participants were randomised to SHF, CHF, or TAU. SHF consisted of market rental apartments with support provided by Assertive Community Treatment (ACT). CHF consisted of a single building with supports equivalent to ACT. TAU included existing services and supports. Results Of 800 people screened, 297 were randomly assigned to CHF (107), SHF (90), or TAU (100). The percentage of time in stable housing over 24 months was 26.3% in TAU (reference; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 20.5, 32.0), compared to 74.3% in CHF (95% CI = 69.3, 79.3, p<0.001) and 74.5% in SHF (95% CI = 69.2, 79.7, p<0.001). Secondary outcomes favoured CHF but not SHF compared to TAU. Conclusion HF in scattered and congregate formats is capable of achieving housing stability among people experiencing major mental illness and chronic homelessness. Only CHF was associated with improvement on select secondary outcomes.

AB  - Given the broad scale and fundamental transformations occurring to both the natural environment and human condition in the present era, what does the future hold for vernacular architecture studies? In a world where Capital A (sometimes referred to as 'polite') architectural icons dominate our skylines and set the agenda for our educational institutions, is the study of vernacular architecture still relevant? What role could it possibly have in understanding and subsequently impacting on architectural education, theory and practice, and in turn, professional built environment design? Imagine for a minute, a world where there is no divide between the vernacular and the 'polite', where all built environments, past and present are open to formal research agendas whereby the inherent knowledge in their built histories inform the professional design paradigm of the day in all built settings, be they formal or informal, Western or non-Western. In this paper, the author is concerned with keeping the flames of intellectual discontent burning in proposing a transformation and reversal of the fortunes of VAS within mainstream architectural history and theory. In a world where a social networking website can ignite a revolution, one can already see the depth of global transformations on the doorstep. No longer is there any excuse to continue intellectualizing global futures solely within a Western (Euro-American) framework. In looking at the history of VAS, the purpose of this paper is to illustrate that the answers for its future pathways lie in an understanding of the intellectual history underpinning its origins. As such, the paper contends that the epistemological divide established in the 1920s by art historians, whereby the exclusion of so-called non-architect architectures from the mainstream canon of architectural history has resulted in an entire architectural corpus being ignored in formal educational institutions and architectural societies today. Due to this exclusion, the majority of mainstream architectural thinkers have resisted theorizing on the vernacular. In the post-colonial era of globalization the world has changed, and along with it, so have many of the original paradigms underpinning the epistemologies setting vernacular environments apart. In exploring this subject, the paper firstly positions this dichotomy within the spectrum of Euro-American architectural history and theory discourse; secondly, draws together the work of scholars who have at some point in the past called for the obsolescence of the term 'vernacular' and the erasure of categorical distinctions that impact on the formal study of what are perceived as non-architectural environments; and finally, sets out the form by which curricula for studies of world architecture could take.

AB  - The private rental sector (PRS) is growing in many advanced economies due to declining home ownership and retrenchment in social housing. This paper examines changes in the PRS in the context of housing market change and ongoing urbanisation processes. Using the example of Australia, it identifies a paradox when examining detailed changes in PRS composition between 1996 and 2011. Increasing demand from higher and lower income households has occurred alongside increasing concentration of supply in mid-market segments. The paper discusses possible explanations of this mismatch. It suggests that middle/higher income households rent through a mixture of constraint and choice in areas with a high level of amenity, adding to understanding of gentrification of inner-city areas. Urban restructuring, evident in increased land values in inner areas of large cities, has resulted in limited filtering down' of older housing into low-rent private rental stock and a concentration of investment in supply in mid-market segments with greatest prospects for resale and rental.

AB  - Objective: Access to adequate housing consistent with personal preferences and needs is a human right and supports recovery from psychosis. This study aimed to: (1) describe people with psychosis living in different housing types, and their preferences and needs; (2) explore selected demographic and social inclusion correlates in relation to housing; and (3) compare two subgroups -participants living in supported group accommodation and supported housing -on key demographic, functional, clinical and social inclusion variables. Method: Current housing, preferences, needs and assistance, and housing-related social inclusion variables were assessed in a two-phase prevalence survey conducted within seven catchment areas across five Australian states. Two supported housing models were compared: supported group accommodation and supported housing (rental accommodation with in-reach support). Descriptive statistics were used. Results: Of the total participants (n = 1825), one half were living in public or private rented housing (48.6%) and 22.7% were waiting for public housing. Despite being the preferred form of housing, only 13.1% were living in their own home. One in 20 participants (5.2%) was currently homeless; 12.8% had been homeless in the previous 12 months. Residents of supported group accommodation felt safer in their locality than those in supported housing, but experienced less privacy and choice. Conclusions: Although fewer participants were homeless compared with the first Australian survey of psychosis, the proportion remains high. Housing difficulties are experienced by people with psychoses living in various accommodation and concern housing adequacy and safety as well as autonomy and choice. Access to public housing is restricted compared with the identified need. Since residents of supported group accommodation felt safer in their locality than those in supported housing, but experienced less privacy and choice, each supported housing model may offer different advantages to people with psychosis, and contribute to services that support and maintain recovery.

AB  - There is a global call for a paradigm shift in the construction industry towards carbon neutrality, but a scant effort has been madein practice, especially concerning circularity. This paper helps bridge the gap by introducing a parametric approach to optimize sustainable construction design. The methodology was tested on a newly constructed office building, inspired by circularity principles, in Westerlo, Belgium. The methodology consists of parametric construction-typological analysis, automated through One Click LCA software (Life Cycle Assessment) and Microsoft Excel with 21 alternate designs and 630 iterations. The parametric variations involved three key performance indicators: construction system, materials' environmental impact, and materials; reuse of content. The environmental effects of both construction systems (i.e., structural system, foundation type, materials, and envelope details) and reused building materials content (i.e.,) were evaluated by the parametric analysis for four construction systems scenarios. Environmental impact analysis for timber, steel, concrete, and hybrid construction systems was conducted, following ISO 14040 and CEN/TC 350 standards. The focus of the whole life cycle assessment was mainly on carbon neutrality. Results indicate that using local biosourced materials, including timber, can remarkably reduce buildings' environmental impact. The sensitivity analysis results provide hard evidence that the construction material's weight, materials reuse potential, and construction dismantling ability are the most influential factors in carbon-neutral buildings. This paper should improve professionals' understanding of the impact of different structural systems choices and inform building designers about the circularity potential, and carbon footprint of construction technologies.

AB  - Located in a typical city with high solar exposure, Lhasa rural houses have the potential to achieve nearly zero consumption of heating energy by applying an efficient passive design method. Field survey, measurement and simulation were applied for the nearly zero energy building (nZEB) design method. After analyzing the architecture form design items of organizing heat collecting surfaces and buffer spaces, 5 out of 9 architecture form design items were proved to contribute to heating energy efficiency, including add-on direct solar gain system on width direction of north rooms, sunroom on roof, north sealed balcony, window-wall ratio (WWR) of south facade and layout shape. The architecture form design was proved to save nearly 80% of the heating energy, and the nZEB design method was proposed. The findings can serve as a guideline for the energy efficiency design for rural houses in high solar exposure area areas of China's severe cold and cold regions.

AB  - This paper develops a new optimal location model for siting affordable housing units to maximize the accessibility of low-income workers to appropriate jobs by public transportation. Transit-accessible housing allows disadvantaged populations to reduce their reliance on automobiles, which can lead to savings on transportation-related expenditures. The housing location model developed here maximizes transit accessibility while reducing the clustering of affordable housing units in space. Accessibility is maximized using a high-resolution space-time metric of public transit accessibility, originally developed for service equity analysis. The second objective disperses subsidized housing projects across space using a new minimax dispersion model based on spatial interaction principles. The multiobjective model trades off accessibility maximization and affordable housing dispersion, subject to upper and lower bounds on the land acquisition and construction budget. The model is tested using data for Tempe, AZ including actual data for vacant parcels, travel times by light rail and bus, and the location of low-wage jobs. This model or similar variants could provide insightful spatial decision support to affordable-housing providers or tax-credit administrators, facilitating the design of flexible strategies that address multiple social goals.

AB  - Bioclimatic design strategies are an efficient architectural approach to improve thermal comfort, save energy, and reduce buildings' carbon footprint. In this study, the effect of five bioclimatic design strategies on energy demands of an office building, considering window-to-wall ratio, solar heat gain coefficient, sun shading with overhangs, thermal insulation and natural ventilation, is investigated along with their associated economic and environmental benefits in the Mediterranean region using EnergyPlus software. For this purpose, six locations were identified to represent different climate's types. The results revealed that the highest energy savings shares were achieved by incorporating thermal insulation and natural ventilation designs in the hot desert climate with 90.69% and 20.21%, respectively. Furthermore, sun shading and small glazing area with low solar heat gain coefficients are recommended for hot climates and vice versa for cold ones. Moreover, the investigated designs exhibited high economic benefits, which translated by lower life cycle costs and payback periods, and higher savings-to-investment ratios, especially thermal insulation and natural ventilation designs. Additionally, significant CO2 emissions are avoided using these designs. The findings of this work could serve as a guideline for building stakeholders to choose the appropriate designs according to the building climatic conditions.

AB  - This study presents a methodological and conceptual framework that allows for the integration and creation of knowledge across professional borders in the field of environmental simulation. The framework has been developed on the basis of interviews with leading international practitioners, key theories of environmental performance in architecture and engineering, and a range of simulation experiments by the authors. The framework is an open structure, which can continuously be renewed and contributed to by any author. The value of the framework is demonstrated, using it to map a series of simulation studies, emphazising the multidimensionality of environmental performance optimization. Clarifying the conceptual interconnectivity between architecture and engineering, - agency and physics, - not only enhances communicative power and the dissemination of knowledge, but becomes instrumental in pointing out the need for improving metrics, software and not least the performance of the built environment itself.

Design/methodology/approach - Using qualitative and quantitative approaches, 24 photos were randomly selected from different urban areas of Brisbane (Australia) city for an online survey. In total, 36 participants evaluated the photos 159 times. Findings - Conducted content analysis resulted in the identification of five attribute-based factors, generated from 16 semantic categories and 74 attributes. Using a non-parametric Chi-square test, the factors were categorised in two levels, i.e. envelope elements (primary and secondary) and passive climatic principles; architectural composition principles and neighbourhood quality. Social implications - The discussion on the results via the theory of planned behaviour suggests that regarding the external aspects, the people's image of energy-efficient housing could be influenced by their perceived control over changeable and adjustable attributes. Originality/value - The photo-based methodology developed by this paper has the potential to quantify occupants' collaborative image of small-size housing energy efficiency, which would be essential in assisting them to adjust their dwelling units regarding the congruity of the energy-efficiency attributes with their preferences.

AB  - In the last decade, many studies focused on finding optimal design solutions considering trade-offs between different aspects of building design. Accordingly, multi -objective optimization (MOO) approaches have been increasingly applied in the building industry. However, certain aspects must be deepened to ensure a more effective decision -making process in the early planning phase. On the one hand, uncertainties should be considered before making decisions to ensure the robustness of the optimal solutions; on the other hand, decisions are made at different times in building planning, and the sequential order of making decisions should be modeled. This paper presents a holistic two -stage multi -objective stochastic optimization (MOSO)-II framework to minimize the environmental impact of global warming potential (GWP) and cost throughout the entire life cycle of a building (phases of A1 -A3, B4, B6 and C3 -C4), considering passive and active design strategies in two consecutive stages, under uncertainty. Herein, individual/use and political/market uncertainties are considered. As a proof of concept, the proposed framework is applied in a case study for a generic zone in a multi -family terraced residential building type with solid brick construction. The advantages of the proposed framework are validated by comparing it with alternative single -stage MOSO frameworks. Results show that the proposed two -stage MOSO-II framework can deliver a smaller range of solutions with a better performance in terms of lower GWP and cost. It indicates that the proposed framework can effectively assist planners in decision -making by reducing the effort in choosing the proper solution. Secondly, the results also emphasize the importance of passive design strategies in sustainable building planning. In addition, the energy mix structure and cost of energy sources should be carefully adjusted in the future to promote a more ecologically sustainable building design.

AB  - Scenario-based assessments are a useful tool to explore unknown futures and inform decision makers and the public of the consequences of different courses of action. Scenario developments in industrial ecology have focused on disparate components of the socioeconomic metabolism and case studies, and few efforts of comprehensive and cumulative scenario formulation are documented. Many important, empirically derived relationships between material cycles, end-use services, and energy use are relevant to global scenario modeling efforts, for example, of integrated assessment models (IAMs), which do not routinely describe material cycles or the life-cycle impacts of various technology shifts. These inconsistent depictions of material cycles and their environmental impacts hinder the assessment of sustainable development strategies such as demand-side sufficiency, material efficiency, and energy efficiency. We developed three highly detailed scenarios covering 20 global regions to 2060 for the service provisioning of dwelling area and personal transport grounded in salient building and vehicle operation parameters. Our scenarios are based on, and interface with, the Low Energy Demand (LED) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1 and SSP2) narratives. The results comprise scenario-, region-, and period-specific narratives and corresponding parameter values, including per-capita floor space and vehicle stocks, building and vehicle archetype mixes, passenger-km, vehicle-km, vehicle occupancy rates, and implementation potentials of nine material efficiency strategies. The explicit storyline extension approach presented here is an alternative to the aggregate GDP-driven or historical trend extrapolations of service or energy demands. We describe the scenario formulation processes, resulting parameters, their applications, and offer an outlook for prospective sustainability models.

AB  - During the last decades, after indoor environment has been extensively analysed, interest has been increased, especially in the outdoor environment and the way it affects both the indoor environment and the overall quality of life in the cities. The scope of this study is to introduce a new approach to urban open space design by following a different design process and setting a new palette of design tools. This study provides a complete methodological tool which allows a simple, quick and easy area analysis that takes into consideration the most crucial microclimatic parameters and can provide the necessary information for the designer on how to create "bioclimatic" outdoor urban spaces for the summer season in Mediterranean climates. The tool provides the designer with comparable information on certain bioclimatic indexes that will assist him to make his design more "bioclimatic" and take the necessary decisions on the basic issues concerning the new area. The above methodology has been already applied to new projects in Greece and its results have already been noticed by the users. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on a recent reassessment, this paper compares the performance of Bangkok's land and housing markets in 1974-84 and 1988-90. The results of the comparative analysis are striking: despite rapid increases in land conversion pressure and price increases, Bangkok's housing developers are still providing considerable amounts of affordable housing. Unconstrained by zoning, they have decentralised development projects and increased project densities dramatically.

AB  - Since the Great Recession, many cities around the world have undergone extreme demographic changes as people and capital resettle into urban areas. This has resulted in issues of gentrification and displacement forcing many governments to address growing concerns of housing insecurity. Housing policy is a function of political ideologies and social conditions drawing from market-based housing supply (MBHS) solutions or demand-side interventions (DSI) to alleviate housing cost burdens. Yet, debates on their effectiveness have often undermined their ability to grow to scale leaving many households in precarious housing situations. This paper focuses on the 2022 Ontario provincial election to uncover how Canadian political parties frame housing insecurity and their policy platforms. This paper finds all political parties promote the MBHS framework, yet various degrees of the DSI framework. Embedded within this variation are questions of federalism with responsibility shifting between provincial and municipal governments. The findings reveal while different forms of neoliberal ideology inform the policy platforms of political parties, federalism plays a significant role in framing the level and scale of government involvement.

AB  - The article presents the objectives of sustainable development and the features of sustainable buildings executed within new urban structures. It presents various aspects of sustainable design, where energy-efficiency is the crucial building evaluation factor in multi-criteria LEED, BREEAM and Green Building methods. It points to the need for the application of a design solution multi-criteria evaluation method with the use of specialist software, within the sustainable design process. The process of evaluating and verifying applied solutions should involve a group of industry specialists, among others, from the field of building energy performance. The role of an architect in an inter-disciplinary design process is that of a leader in terms of coordinating the work, and a creator, where humanistic values are crucial. It also presents examples of buildings designed and constructed in Poland, which are characterized by high quality solutions in the field of sustainable design. These objects obtained LEED, BREEAM, Green Building and Passivhaus certificates.

AB  - Resilient building design is becoming increasingly important as occurrence and duration of extreme weather events increase. These events cause disruptions in building operation and safety due to lack of electric power or fuel. Several resilient design strategies exist, many of which are also sustainable or energy saving design strategies. Specifically, passive building strategies that favor energy conservation in buildings also have a positive impact on the building's resilience. Passive survivability is a key element to resilience, which can be assessed by simulating interior conditions during power outages in building energy modeling software. This paper will address passive survivability metrics and assessment protocol for passive survivability including a proposed methodology to derive climatic resilience design weeks. Additionally, it will cover simulation results from dynamic modeling completed in WUFI Plus. These simulations assess passive survivability during power outages in varying multifamily building designs and inform the audience on how building design influences a building's ability to maintain desirable interior conditions during outages.

AB  - Educational buildings across Europe refer to a large amount of structures for which critical interventions are necessary. Particularly, for old buildings, comprehensive refurbishment efforts are essential, in order to enhance the indoor comfort conditions and establish the best possible settings for students and users. Evidently, the above issue is decisive to stimulate and support students with reference to the learning process and aims of the educational system (superior learning performance); this has also a positive effect on users' interaction with the nearby environment, in terms of social adaptability and health for children and adults. In this context, the main goal is to transform entirely the design of educational building spaces with respect to the initial conditions. To this end, governments often set targets on upgrading and utilizing school infrastructure in the urban district (mostly, for school classes situated in the urban core of the social and local communities). As is well known, the improvement of a building from a building physics point of view is fundamentally related to the attainment of acceptable hygrothermal, visual and acoustic comfort conditions. On the other hand, limiting the heat flux through the buildings' envelope and restricting CO2 emissions, is of great importance, from an environmental point of view. However, the complexity and significance to assess educational facilities mostly relies on the use of heating in winter and the absence of cooling systems during summer. In addition, climate change, which results into growing values of the air temperature, makes it difficult to attain acceptable indoor comfort conditions with natural ventilation. To reduce this effect, especially in the southern part of Europe, shading devices, as well as ventilation and cooling systems offer rational approaches to scrutinize the indoor environment. The central points of the present investigation, with respect to the indoor comfort conditions of educational buildings in different climate zones, during the cooling season, are as follows: (a) the retrofit measures to improve the thermal performance during heat waves; (b) how to gain tolerable indoor comfort conditions with or without a cooling; (c) the implementation of adaptive thermal comfort models. A dynamic thermal simulation on three levels (envelope, classroom, school building) has been carried out in order to assess the school building stock and investigate possibilities of improvements . For three different locations several retrofit scenarios have been evaluated by considering adaptive comfort standards (for typical users, as well as for children). Furthermore, to stretch the impact of this investigation, the analysis has been extended for a real case study: the "Modulo Didattico" building in the Smart Campus of the University of Brescia. At last, the integrated workflow of the design process is presented, considering both BIM and BEM data, and demonstrating an interesting application of visualization techniques for assessment of the comfort conditions in the different thermal zones. The study is the outcome of a collaborative workplan between the University of Brescia (unibs, Italy) and the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (A. U. Th., Greece).

AB  - The past decade has seen the world building committee strive to ensure the energy efficiency of our built environment. A building's roof is often the most effective envelope in conserving energy. The roof system, if designed properly, can mitigate energy loss or gain and allow the building's mechanical systems to function properly for occupant comfort. Energy conservation is increasingly being viewed as an important performance objective for governmental, educational, commercial and industrial construction. Interest in the conserving of energy is high and is being actively discussed at all levels of the building industry: Governmental, Codes and Standards and Trade Organizations. As with many systems it is the details that are the difference between success and failure. This presentation will be based on the author's 35 years of roof system design and infield empirical experience and will review key design elements in the detailing of energy conserving roof systems. Best design and detail practices for roofing to achieve conservation will be delineated, in field examples reviewed and details provided.

AB  - A prominent place in the spatial arrangement of Czech as well as other post-socialist, Central European cities belongs to 19th century closed urban blocks and the open panel housing estates which were erected during the socialism era in the second half of 20th century. The urban characteristics of these two fundamentally diverse types of residential structures have, as we suppose, a different impact on the sustainable development of the urban area. The amount and character of local greenery, the spatial arrangement and accessibility of the courtyards, the spatial forms of the surrounding buildings and many other factors can influence the ecological stability of the area, its hygienic qualities, the intensity and way of using by various social groups, and also e.g. the prices of real estates. These and many other phenomena indicate the ecological, hygienic, social and economic sustainability of the urban area. The research methodology evaluates specific measureable indicators of sustainability within a range from 0 to 10 points where 5 points correspond to the general standard in the area, 0 points indicate degradation, and 10 points indicate the highest contribution to sustainable development. The survey results are reflected in the overall sustainability index and in the residents' satisfaction index that reflects the subjective satisfaction based on questionnaires surveys. The paper analyses the residential structures in the Central European city of Brno, Czech Republic. The case studies of the urban blocks near the city centre and of the panel housing estate Brno - Vinohrady are compared. The results imply that a considerable positive impact on the sustainable development of the area should be ascribed to the green closed urban blocks near the city centre. These urban blocks with a closed courtyard provide a quality outdoor environment with a certain level of privacy. This factor can significantly support the development of local community.

AB  - Sharing is a form of human activity as a social being, over resources or spaces. Humans generally define their space according to their psychological and biological needs. However, what if space sharing takes place in an urban scope? The phenomenon of space sharing happens in Kemang area done by two distinct sectors, formal and informal which both are engaged in commercial activities independently. In the study of territory and the behavior settings, the quality of environment can affect the formation of human activities in a space, occurs a phenomenon of space sharing. The researcher will discuss and present a form of the space sharing by the formal and informal sectors in a commercial area through different environmental qualities. In some circumstance, a form of space sharing can increase the value of space and obtain to a shared space, where both sectors mutually take benefits. Otherwise, it leads to an adverse impact in some others. It is clear that differences in the physical environment and social environment have an impact on the formation of space sharing and the value of space in an urban region.

AB  - One of the main factors affecting the acceptance of social housing projects is the non-participation of users in their building's design. The VIS Project breaks with this idealistic scheme of unilateral projection and proposes a concurrent engineering where citizen participation is taken into account in the collection of statistical data and also in its idiosyncrasy, ancestral values and life models. The Quality Function Deployment is one of the methodologies that are implemented in addition to bioclimatic design with passive cooling and solar control strategies. The multidisciplinary team made up of engineers, architects and interior and industrial designers together with students of Architecture and Interior Design careers of the School of Architecture and Urbanism of the University of Guayaquil have managed to bring to low-income sectors practical solutions to self-build dwellings problems. The procedures and methods applied are adapted to the particular case of each user, giving particular solutions analyzed under multiple criteria.

AB  - Current media architecture practice demonstrates the rich potential of interactive media in our built environment for various economic, social and cultural purposes. However, the meaningful integration of interactive media with(in) architecture remains challenging, as architects typically expect that media-specific qualities amplify the architectural intentions and experience of the built environment. This paper demonstrates how this challenge can be tackled by grounding the design rationale of an interactive media architecture manifestation on fundamental architectural motives, such as the intended physical, experiential and communicative characteristics. More specifically, we discuss the design rationale of a permanent, sound based media facade that will consist of the dynamic mechanical actuation of multiple wooden window frames. By explicitly articulating the design rationale in an architectural framework, this paper aims to inform emerging HCI research on human-building interaction (HBI) from a 'building' perspective.

AB  - Housing has been one of the most pressing problems during the urbanization process in modern Britain. This paper tried to interpret housing policies beyond the fields of politics and laws, and understand this issue with a new perspective of town planning. Through combing the changes of housing policies within the scope of town planning, and combining the relevant housing legislations and local authorities' practice, this paper analyzed various features and effects of housing policies in public health, housing planning and comprehensive planning stages respectively. Housing polices have been deeply incorporated into town planning polices and evolved with the latter. Consequently, residents have gained not only sanitary and adequate houses, but also the improved urban environment. As town planning developed in depth and scope, housing policies even became an efficient method to evacuate the population in big cities and the important measure to optimalize spatial structure at the reginal level.

AB  - In recent years, the evaluation of building performance in terms of environmental, social and economic aspects has become a topic of discussion in the Slovak Republic. The criteria of sustainability are included in building environmental assessment systems and tools used in different countries for evaluating their sustainable and environmental performance. A Building Environmental Assessment System (BEAS) has been developed at the Institute of Environmental Engineering, Technical University of Kosice. The proposed fields are site selection & project planning; building construction; indoor environmental quality; energy performance; water and waste management. This paper deals with proposal of building environmental assessment system, especially assessment of aspects and indicators in the field of building construction. The evaluated indicators were proposed on the basis of available information analysis from each field of integrated assessment of buildings as well as on the basis of our experiences. The goal of this paper is to present significance weighting determination of proposed indicators. Percentage weight of significance is determined according to methods of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The results of presented field of environmental assessment system are verified on selected buildings.

AB  - Amman's land typology is characterized by hilly slopes, and this presents challenges and opportunities for architects and designers aiming at delivering sustainable buildings. The research focuses on the importance of any site's given criteria; mainly its slope and topography on the delivery of sustainable buildings. Amman city consists broadly of two main types of buildings; apartment buildings and villas, by studying each type of building with regard to its environmental context on a given site in the city; the research seeks to identify the sustainable variables that site topography delimit or facilitate, using a set of attributes for each building type. The main objective of this research is to highlight the sustainable approach for building on sloped sites throughout the building project life-cycle in general, and to set a sustainability framework for designers during the initial design phase in particular. A number of case studies for both types of buildings are studied and analysed, and conclusions are given based on syntheses of available data from literature review or case analysis. At the end, the research provides a mechanism for the development of guidelines for sustainable and passive viability on preferred buildings orientation in hilly areas with regard to local climatic data..

AB  - The last three decades of the twentieth century have seen the emergence of a relatively new set of building design criteria that are based on ecological concerns. These are driven by a genuine fear that mankind has been recklessly ignoring repeated signs that the delicate balance in nature among plants, animals, and the physical environment is in danger of disruption with serious consequences. Contributing factors that are rapidly gaining widespread recognition include: an increasing world population (approaching seven billion in 2009); a fairly sudden change from inexpensive to much more expensive energy; an increasing realization that environmental pollution and lifestyle will have an impact on health and longevity; the detection of a gradual but steady global warming trend; and the marked transition to an Information Age in which the interests and capabilities of the individual are greatly enabled. The confluence of these powerful environmental and societal forces is having a profound impact. With the increase in population, agriculture is gradually losing in its competition with residential development. As the cost of land increases, the need for denser habitation also increases the negative human impact on nature. An increasing demand for water, energy, and materials is eroding the availability of natural resources on planet Earth. Moreover, the extraction and processing of the large amounts of raw materials to fulfill these needs not only damages the ecostructure, but also increases the pollution of the atmosphere to a level that has in some localized instances threatened the very existence of animal and human life. In particularly, water has emerged as the most precious resource for habitation, agriculture, and the continuation of life itself. From a more general point of view the impact of these forces can be recognized as trends to which we adapt in both conscious and subconscious ways. For example, as the economy has shifted from an industrial to a service base, women have entered the workforce in much greater numbers. The smaller two-income family has different household and child-raising needs with direct architectural implications. If we add to this the enablement of the individual through the availability of computers and global connectivity, then it becomes readily apparent that the architectural criteria for the design of buildings and, in particular, homes have already changed and will continue to change as a means of adapting to these trends.

AB  - Once measurements have been taken of the existing home environment, this information needs to be put into a format that can be understood by the person approving the recommendations, developing the architectural drawings, or undertaking the modification work. Occupational therapists need to know how to read and use drawings and have an understanding of their basic components in order to communicate effectively with others in the home modification field. Therapists need to know the different stages of plan development and the alternative types of plan views and be familiar with the technical drawing conventions used in the design profession in order to communicate with construction personnel. An understanding of how and when to draw to scale and being familiar with the various types of drawing tools and technologies can enhance the professionalism and credibility of therapists as they work with others in the design and building profession.

AB  - This paper analyses whether the decision to commute by car is influenced by built environment characteristics of residential neighbourhoods and, more especially, of work locations, taking into account interdependencies between household partners. It shows that the residential environment only affects car use among single-earners. Conversely, for all commuters, but in particular for dual-earners, characteristics of the work location affect whether they commute by car. Even in dual-earner households with two cars, work environment plays a role. We found that in cases of dual-earners with only one car, the partners with the longest commuting distances and the lowest density work locations are most likely to commute by car. Moreover, in households with young children, men are more inclined to leave the car at home. Other features relating to work also affect car commuting, including work flexibility and, especially, possession of a company car. We conclude that future policies aimed at reducing car use should place greater focus on work factors.

AB  - While public health and urban planning fields worked closely to tackle communicable disease outbreaks in the 19th century, this collaboration faded during the 20th century. Over the last few decades, engagement in physical activity - even walking - has declined substantially, with serious impacts on population health. Recently there has been an emerging body of literature and guidance illustrating the role the built environment has in shaping health outcomes; much of this has focussed on physical activity behaviours. Associations between built environment attributes and physical activity have been reported by many studies, however the geographic scales at which these built environment attributes need to be measured and the magnitude of the built environment attributes required to support physical activity are not clear. Further studying these geographical scales and thresholds will facilitate development of specific guidance to urban designers and planners to create supportive built environments to facilitate physical activity engagement. This is an important addition for re-connecting the fields of public health and urban design and planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Southeast Tunisian cave dwellings of Matmata are a well-known historical model which amazingly adapt with cultural, environmental and climatic features of its surrounding. Many studies have discussed the sustainability of these dwellings but none has thoroughly discussed its performance on light of health and wellbeing of its dwellers. The WELLV1 rating system, established in 2016, is a first of a kind certification system that solely focus on the health performance of the built environment. It gives credit to designs that enhance and promote physical and psychological health of the users. The study examines the health performance of Matmata cave dwellings in the light of WELLV1 recommendations and features. The study revealed that these subterranean historical dwellings have proven good performance in relation to daylight saturation, indoor thermal relief, solar glare control, physical activity enhancement, exterior noise reduction, biophilic design and cultural enrichment. On the other hand, they lack sufficient performance in relation to air purification, social interaction, clean water supply, and altruism encouragement. Considering the scientific background, materials and technologies available for those who designed and built these dwellings, the health-related performance of their work seems unique and impressive.
