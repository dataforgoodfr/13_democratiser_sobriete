AB  - The special focus on historic buildings is important as little progress has been made in this respect, although it is a crucial problem in most European cities. The fact that public institutions are often located in historic buildings makes this problem relevant for decision-makers themselves. Fossil fuels heating these buildings are expensive and further difficulties arise from the complexity of regulations that need to be complied with and also from possible social implications. How can GovernEE Central Europe Project help? GovernEE aims at rationalising energy use of public buildings, with a special focus on historic buildings, by approaching the problem from the point of view of good governance: · Strengthen the responsibilities of policy makers and the wider public regarding energy efficiency; · Incorporate energy efficiency measures into decision-making processes of municipalities by promoting a cross-sectoral approach; · Strengthen policy makers' planning competences by developing integrated urban development plans prioritising energy efficiency goals.

AB  - Being sustainable is now a source of competitive advantage and a question of survival for the supply chains. Indeed, several researches were conducted about this topic by covering several aspects such as the design of the supply chains, their optimization and the evaluation of their performance. However, concerning the performance evaluation of the sustainable supply chain, the models suggested are generally limited to some indicators of performance. In this regard, the objective of this article consists in presenting a framework for the economic, environmental and social performance evaluation within the supply chain. To this end, we proposed a model of performance evaluation of the supply chains relying on indicators which reflect the three dimensions of sustainable development. Then we resorted to the PROMETHEE method which allowed us to attain a ranking of some best practices of the supply chain management based on the simultaneous improvement, and according to various strategies, of the economic, environmental and social performances. This research enabled us to identify the best practices to be implemented to obtain sustainable supply chains.

AB  - The ultimate aim and critical role of education is shaping human behaviour. It is our prime duty to take care of the well-being of the earth. The present day society needs to formulate an innovative Educational Policy aimed to evolve a “Complete Man” with three major goals; Academic Excellence, Moral and Spiritual Values and Social Sensibilities. Responsible behaviour is the need of the hour; and Ecological sciences are door to sustainable development. We have to be cautious of our limited resources that we consume without thinking about future scenario. Educating our children from early childhood and inculcating good values and habits may lay strong foundation and lead us to a path of sustainable development. Consciousness is awareness. Environmental awareness is to understand the fragility of our environment and the importance of its protection. One needs to be aware of the duties and responsibilities, in order to deal effectively and conserve the environment. Environmental education's primary goals are to deepen students' engagement with issues in environment and science and take sensitive actions to improve the quality of life. There is a correlation between quality and values.

AB  - Towards the development of a sustainable campus of higher education institutions, energy consumption behavior of students is one of the several matters that require attention. Insights in to the energy consumption behavior of students will help to chalk out a good strategy for energy management. The purpose of this study is to assess energy consumption behavior among Indian higher education institutions students. This study has an objective to determine the factors which influence the energy consumption behaviors of students. The `energy culture' framework from the literature is used in the study for arriving at the energy consumption behavior pattern of the students. Further the study also explores the role that personality of the student plays in exhibiting a sustainable energy consumption behavior. A self-administrated survey was carried out involving 75 respondents at Amrita University. The students were assessed on Building Regulation, Environmental Concern, Social Aspiration and Comfort along with Education, Activities, Social Marketing and Personality variables of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness and Emotional stability. The data was analyzed using multiple regression and the results revealed that the independent variables Education, Activities, Social Marketing and Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Emotional stability were influencing the dependent variables of Building Regulation, Environmental Concern, Social Aspiration and Comfort. Social marketing and Education were strongly and significantly related to the all the dependent variables. The personality variables of Conscientiousness, Extraversion also was found to be strongly and significantly related to Environmental Concern, Social Aspiration and Comfort. This study highlights the need for understanding social marketing, education and personality as an important potential variable for promoting energy efficient consumption behavior among students. The present study contributes to an understanding of the factors influencing the Energy Consumption Behavior Pattern and thus work attempts to make a small contribution to theory and research in Energy Consumption.

AB  - The international shipping industry is facing with increasingly strict emission regulations and depressed market; lowering the cost and increasing the efficiency is becoming a universal practice. For a long time, global community and the International Maritime organization (IMO) have been closely working together, a list of regulations and solutions are worked out; in the meantime, many energy efficiency improvement methods are proposed. In this study, global efforts in tackling climate change are summarized using a timeline approach, which includes the important outcomes of the United Nations Climate Change Conference and the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting. Then, aiming at the energy efficiency operational indicator proposed by the IMO, the mechanism analysis method is used to summarize the influencing factors of the ship’s energy efficiency. Last, these influencing factors are analyzed from different perspectives. This study provides a basis for the requirement analysis of the ship energy efficiency monitoring system and also benefits in working out energy efficiency improvement measures for the operational ships.

AB  - It goes beyond doubt, that a move towards a more globally sustainable economy is only possible with increased capital infusion into projects that are environment friendly. Governments across continents have committed under the 2015 Paris Agreement that calls for arresting the increase in global temperature below 2 degree Celsius [1]. This demands significant capital to fund these projects. One possible investment avenue is Climate (Green) Bonds. On one hand investors globally are encouraged to re-model there business beyond financial values and look into environmental values [2]. On the other hand, many investors shy away from such capital commitments due to lack of universal policy framework and guidelines pertaining to these bonds. This paper looks into how climate bonds (green bonds) can help in bridging the climate finance gap, an important pillar of United Nation’s (UN) Global Sustainable Development plan and provides a suggestive framework to overcome the barriers that hinders the development of a robust climate bonds market in emerging markets.

AB  - The world is advancing towards a great future where the demand of electricity is rising day by day. In order to cope up with this rising demand, more power plants are commissioned. Most of the power plants use fossil fuel to produce electricity, hence are subjected to emissions to air, water and soil. This study uses life cycle assessment approach to measure the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and its impact on global warming as well as to analyze the effect on climate change per unit kWh of electricity produced in a natural gas thermal power plant in the context of Bangladesh. The plant studied here comprises of different types of units and uses natural gas as fuel. The methods used in the analysis are CML 2001 and Eco-Indicator 99(H). The total GHG emission and climate change potential (CCP) from the natural gas thermal power plant were respectively 0.529 kg CO2 eq/kWh and 1.51E-8 DALY/kWh electricity generation. This study also shows that a natural gas combined cycle unit emits less greenhouse gas than any gas engine unit or modular unit.

First, we now better understand that global health concerns cannot be tackled and solved individually and verify that the dream for universal health care is far from being fulfilled. Besides, biomedical technologies and medical devices, despite their transformative potential, cannot always reach those urgently needing them, due to centralized production, supply chain issues, intellectual property restrictions, and lack of raw materials and resources close to the point of care, which calls for a renovation of the biomedical industry aimed at sustainability and equity. To make matters worse, unethical behaviors of governments, companies, and citizens, from which the ongoing pandemic has provided plenty of examples, also endanger the already challenging progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including “Goal 3” on “Good Health and Well Being.”

AB  - The Incentive Captive Power Acquisition Policy of PT PLN (Persero) in Indonesia is examined in this paper. The policy's main goal is energy surplus optimization. This study evaluates the policy's effectiveness in maximizing customer-generated units' economic value, enabling the transition to PLN energy sources, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable business concepts are also examined in this research to address excessive electricity supply. Case study-based descriptive qualitative research is used to analyze the data. The research conducted uses the Sustainable Business Model Canvas (SBMC) to build and evaluate sustainable business concepts. Researchers utilize the Delphi approach to gather primary data and insights via in-depth interviews and concentrated group discussions. Secondary data is used to assess the captive acquisition program. The report shows that the Incentive Captive Power Acquisition Policy has improved PT PLN (Persero)'s economic performance and reduced emissions for program users. The Incentive Captive Power Policy uses a comprehensive commercial approach to maximize power-providing efficiency in Indonesia. Switching electricity from customer-owned generators to PLN supply increases kWh sales and decreases consumer emissions. This work makes important contributions to power surplus management and sustainable business strategies, which affect worldwide markets.

AB  - Electric Vehicles (EVs) with numerous optimized features are becoming more popular in today’s world of vehicle technology. This is especially in these days when climate change is becoming more of a concern, and the usage of renewable energy is promoted. These EVs require frequent charging for daily use, and the usage of different charging stations would store sensitive data about EVs, e.g., location, driver’s license, etc. This leads to significant privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we will investigate the existing solutions proposed in the literature to address these concerns. Some of these solutions are implementing a framework that depends on cryptography and the Matching Market, where cryptography plays a vital role in securing user information privacy. Other solutions include implementing a secure and privacy-preserving physical layer-assisted scheme for charging stations to improve authentication and preserve user privacy. Finally, we provide a comprehensive comparison of the existing works, followed by our recommendations for future research directions to enhance the security level for future electric vehicle transportation systems.

AB  - The linkage between CO2 releases and the utilization of sustainable energy sources is a critical issue in the context of sustainable development and climate change. Studies have shown that greater use of sustainable energy sources reduces CO2 releases and improves air quality. The main cause of CO2 releases, fossil fuels, has been largely replaced, which is to blame for the decline in CO2 releases. Investigating the connection between India's utilization of sustainable energy sources and CO2 releases is the goal of this study. The impact of using sustainable energy sources on India's CO2 releases is investigated through research. Correlation study was done to look into the degree of correlation between using sustainable energy sources and CO2 releases. The amount of energy derived from sustainable sources and CO2 releases were found to be negatively correlated using multilinear regression analysis. Future projections for India's use of sustainable energy showed a diminishing trend and an increase in CO2 releases.

AB  - An energy audit study is conducted for a residential apartment complex in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. In the apartment complex two different tariff policy were applicable; slab rate-based charges for individual houses and ToD based charges for the common areas. Thus, cost reduction initiatives were done two ways; replacement with energy efficient appliances in houses and Demand response (DR) initiatives in common areas. The suggested energy saving initiatives is to replace the existing appliance with energy efficient alternatives. A house’s average energy consumption is reduced from 9.3 kWh to 4.143 kWh. The DR is completed for the lift and water pump. A mathematical model for the implementation of DR is developed. The annual savings from demand response are ₹6257.2. A study is also being carried out to replace the Diesel Generator (DG) set with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). By replacing the DG set, the cost per kWh of BESS is reduced by half, from ₹35.94 to ₹15.82. As a result, the overall energy consumption of the building is reduced from 267.9 kWh to 168.5 kWh. This Energy Audit study can be applied to any apartment complex in India.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine whether a retail mall in Ilorin, Nigeria, could benefit from the use of a PV-Wind-Battery-Diesel hybrid energy system (HES) as a backup energy source. The case study has a daily average energy demand of 1540 kWh, with a peak demand of 240 kW. Fluke 432-II Power Quality and Energy Analyzer is used to record the daily average energy demand data. A year wind speed and solar irradiation data was sourced from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website. The results are juxtaposed with those generated by the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software. The PV-Battery-Diesel design produces the best scenario result, according to both methods. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the proposed system design economic feasibility. Based on a comparative cost analysis, the HES, which is to cost $0.31/kWh (N439.89/kWh), is not economically sustainable when compared to the $0.02/kWh (N35.35) that most electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) in Nigeria charge.

AB  - In digital forensics and various sectors like medicine and supply chain, blockchains play a crucial role in providing a secure and tamper-resistant system that meticulously records every detail, ensuring accountability. However, collaboration among different agencies, each with its own blockchains, creates challenges due to diverse protocols and a lack of interoperability, hindering seamless information sharing. Cross-chain technology has been introduced to address these challenges. Current research about blockchains in digital forensics, tends to focus on individual agencies, lacking a comprehensive approach to collaboration and the essential aspect of cross-chain functionality. This emphasizes the necessity for a framework capable of effectively addressing challenges in securely sharing case information, implementing access controls, and capturing provenance data across interconnected blockchains. Our solution, ForensiCross, is the first cross-chain solution specifically designed for digital forensics and provenance. It includes BridgeChain and features a unique communication protocol for cross-chain and multi-chain solutions. ForensiCross offers meticulous provenance capture and extraction methods, mathematical analysis to ensure reliability, scalability considerations for a distributed intermediary in collaborative blockchain contexts, and robust security measures against potential vulnerabilities and attacks. Analysis and evaluation results indicate that ForensiCross is secure and, despite a slight increase in communication time, outperforms in node count efficiency and has secure provenance extraction. As an all-encompassing solution, ForensiCross aims to simplify collaborative investigations by ensuring data integrity and traceability.

AB  - The adoption of sustainable practices is being prompted by resource scarcity and climate change in every industry worldwide. One of the biggest consumers of energy are buildings, which account for 19% of all energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 32% of global final energy use. Educational buildings frequently have quite high energy consumption patterns compared to public buildings. Existing buildings can be retrofitted to significantly cut global energy use, carbon emissions, and improve building performance. This paper seeks to assess the barriers militating against low carbon retrofitting of educational buildings and ways of addressing these barriers to reduce carbon emissions. Thematic analysis revealed that lack of awareness, financial issues, high cost of retrofitting, lack of skilled workers and unwillingness on the part of client are key barriers to low carbon retrofitting of educational building projects. To address such barriers, it was revealed that training of professionals on retrofitting, having a mandatory energy efficiency retrofitting policy, dedicated financing mechanism and enlightening clients on need for retrofitting. It is therefore important for government to put policies in place and create enabling environment that will make implementation of low carbon retrofitting possible.

AB  - The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) industry has created significant interest in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). OPVs hold promise for indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) due to their tunable bandgap, high absorbance coefficient, semitransparency, solution processability, lightweight nature, affordability, and eco-friendly, making them ideal for powering indoor smart devices with minimal energy consumption. However, challenges remain in achieving environmental stability, large-scale production, improving power efficiency, and extending minority carrier lifespans. Various strategies, including doping, passivation, buffer layers, and electron-reflecting layers, have been explored to enhance the absorber layer properties. This review evaluates the current state of OPV cell development, focusing on recent advancements in material selection, design methodologies, market trends, and strategies to achieve high efficiency under low-light indoor conditions. The impact of emerging technologies such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) on IPV progress is also investigated. Furthermore, it highlights the evolving role of organic materials in driving comprehensive advancements and addressing challenges in IPVs. Ultimately, OPVs are identified as essential for achieving net-zero emissions and supporting sustainable development goals.

AB  - Food waste is a significant issue for food packaging companies, with extending the shelf life of perishable items a primary goal of modern preservation technology. Edible films and coatings (EFC) offer a promising, sustainable solution to this challenge, drawing attention for their effectiveness in reducing waste by prolonging food shelf life. These coatings and films incorporates binding agents (food-grade), solvents, and additives (plasticizers, surfactants, cross-linkers, antimicrobial agents, nanoparticles, and fruit or vegetable residues) to modify EFC properties. Biopolymers in EFCs, when combined with plasticizers and other additives, alter the film and coatings physical and functional characteristics. The film-forming processes involve intermolecular forces like covalent bonding (disulphide bonds and cross-linking) along with electrostatic, hydrophobic, and ionic interactions. EFC are produced through methods like spraying, dipping, extrusion etc. Integrating polysaccharide, protein, and lipid ingredients into the film and coating matrix improves the quality of minimally processed or fresh-cut foods, helping to reduce post-harvest losses of perishable items. Broader adoption of EFCs by consumers and the food industry would enhance food quality and bring social and environmental benefits. This research compiles extensive information on EFC-forming materials—such as gums, nanoparticles, and horticultural residues—demonstrating their effectiveness, regulatory considerations, and protective qualities across various food types.

AB  - Facility management maintains building service quality through cycles of condition assessments and rehabilitation. Building components, however, differ in their nature, service lives, deterioration patterns, and textual/visual inspection data. This complicates the condition assessment process and subsequent rehabilitation decisions. This paper proposes a smart condition assessment framework that uses different artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that suit the condition data analysis of different building components. The framework has been applied to a dataset of over 2000 maintenance requests for roof and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems across a 600-villa portfolio. To address their varying needs, convolutional neural networks were used on images of roof defects, while enhanced data mining was used on textual data of HVAC systems. Accordingly, work packages of deteriorated components were identified, and a 60-day schedule was developed to repair 203 HVAC units. This research shows how AI can assist facility management with respect to condition assessment, rehabilitation planning, and resource allocation.

AB  - Based on the Maisotensko cycle (M-cycle), dew point evaporative cooling (DPEC) technology is a promising solution to address the growing demand for affordable and sustainable cooling in buildings. This review article thoroughly explores the experimental, theoretical, and optimization methodologies used to assess the effectiveness of a dew point evaporative cooling system. The main findings indicate that innovations in the design and structure of heat and mass exchangers (HMX), advancements in wet materials, and improvements in water distribution systems can significantly enhance DPEC performance by maximizing heat transfer between dry and wet channels. Analytical solutions, numerical simulations, and statistical design methodologies have been employed to evaluate DPEC system characteristics, facilitating a comprehensive understanding and comparison. It was found that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools considering heat and mass transport from porous materials improve the design parameters. The genetic algorithm based multi-to-single objective optimization (MSOO) technique will enhance the performance significantly. Practical implications include integrating DPEC with liquid desiccant and vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) systems, demonstrating high energy-saving potential. In conclusion, combining DPEC technology with energy-efficient building design, including intelligent heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, with advanced materials such as aerogel, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and phase change materials (PCMs) coupled with artificial intelligence (AI), offers a promising solution towards achieving sustainability goals and achieving zero carbon footprint.

AB  - In the last few years, the trend in health care of embracing artificial intelligence (AI) has dramatically changed the medical landscape. Medical centres have adopted AI applications to increase the accuracy of disease diagnosis and mitigate health risks. AI applications have changed rules and policies related to healthcare practice and work ethics. However, building trustworthy and explainable AI (XAI) in healthcare systems is still in its early stages. Specifically, the European Union has stated that AI must be human-centred and trustworthy, whereas in the healthcare sector, low methodological quality and high bias risk have become major concerns. This study endeavours to offer a systematic review of the trustworthiness and explainability of AI applications in healthcare, incorporating the assessment of quality, bias risk, and data fusion to supplement previous studies and provide more accurate and definitive findings. Likewise, 64 recent contributions on the trustworthiness of AI in healthcare from multiple databases (i.e., ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore) were identified using a rigorous literature search method and selection criteria. The considered papers were categorised into a coherent and systematic classification including seven categories: explainable robotics, prediction, decision support, blockchain, transparency, digital health, and review. In this paper, we have presented a systematic and comprehensive analysis of earlier studies and opened the door to potential future studies by discussing in depth the challenges, motivations, and recommendations. In this study a systematic science mapping analysis in order to reorganise and summarise the results of earlier studies to address the issues of trustworthiness and objectivity was also performed. Moreover, this work has provided decisive evidence for the trustworthiness of AI in health care by presenting eight current state-of-the-art critical analyses regarding those more relevant research gaps. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the feasibility of utilising trustworthy and XAI applications in healthcare, by incorporating data fusion techniques and connecting various important pieces of information from available healthcare datasets and AI algorithms. The analysis of the revised contributions revealed crucial implications for academics and practitioners, and then potential methodological aspects to enhance the trustworthiness of AI applications in the medical sector were reviewed. Successively, the theoretical concept and current use of 17 XAI methods in health care were addressed. Finally, several objectives and guidelines were provided to policymakers to establish electronic health-care systems focused on achieving relevant features such as legitimacy, morality, and robustness. Several types of information fusion in healthcare were focused on in this study, including data, feature, image, decision, multimodal, hybrid, and temporal.

In particular, we provide an abstract model of in-network storage to show how n out of m codes can be used, and we discuss how this can be achieved in five cases of study. We also define a model aimed at evaluating the probability of correct data encoding and decoding, we exploit this model and simulations to show how, in the cases of study, the parameters of the n out of m codes and the network should be configured in order to achieve correct data coding and decoding with high probability.

AB  - Given the escalating concerns posed by climate change-related disasters, there is an urgent need for a more sustainable and resilient built environment. The developing digital revolution in recent years has the potential to harness its superior features to achieve sustainable and resilient building sector goals. This paper aims to present a futuristic perspective on the three basic pillars of a more sustainable and resilient built environment. These pillars comprise sustainability, resilience, and the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for monitoring and managing structural health and performance. This is evident in the context of smart buildings and their ability to enhance energy consumption efficiency, improve quality of life, and strengthen structural health monitoring in terms of reducing damage and facilitating timely maintenance operations. Through comparing the components of the virtual city designed from two types of alkali-activated binder concrete (AABC) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete, all components of the city designed from AABC showed a reduction in the amount of emitted CO2. The highest decrease was observed in the schools designed from AABC, where the reduction was about 25 %, while the lowest decrease was for the villas and infrastructure; about 11 % and 10 % respectively, compared to those designed from OPC concrete. The results also indicated that the utilization of sustainable concrete instead of traditional varieties has the potential to decrease CO2 emissions by up to 25 %. The importance of this work resides in establishing a basis for forthcoming research that combines intelligent, environmentally friendly, and resilient building practices.

AB  - It is no longer possible to enter the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris, the most visited monument in the world, since its fire on April 15, 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has made tourism impossible for months and very difficult for years. However, virtual tours using immersive reality headsets provide a new alternative. This article studies how cathedrals can benefit from augmented and virtual reality and artificial intelligence to provide an intense cultural, historical, and religious experience for its visitors. A multiple case study is carried out in three cathedrals: Notre-Dame de Paris, France; the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter in Exeter, England; and the Catedral de Santa María de la Sede in Seville, Spain. The findings show how immersive technologies can be used to preserve cathedrals and allow visitors to access the inaccessible from the comfort of their homes, to follow their desires, including the impossible and the forbidden, resulting in a deep spiritual experience and a perception of the virtual as being at least as powerful as that of the real.

AB  - The housing sector consumes a significant amount of energy worldwide, which is mainly attributed to operating energy systems for the provision of thermally comfortable indoor environments. Although the literature in this field has focused on investigating critical factors in energy consumption, only a few studies have conducted a quantitative sensitivity analysis for thermal occupant factors (TOF) (i.e., metabolic rate and clothing level). Therefore, this paper introduces a framework for testing the criticality of TOF with a cross-comparison against building-related factors, considering the constraint of occupant thermal comfort. Using a building energy simulation model, the energy consumption of a case study is simulated, and building energy model alternatives are generated. The scope includes TOF and building envelope factors, with an established orthogonal experimental design. A popular branch of machine learning (ML) called linear genetic programming (LGP) is used to analyse the generated data from the experiment. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted using the developed LGP model to determine and rank the criticality of the considered factors. The findings reveal that occupants' metabolic rate and clothing level have relevancy factors of −0.48 and −0.38 respectively, which ranked them 2nd and 3rd against building envelope factors for achieving energy-efficient comfortable houses. This research contributes to the literature by introducing a framework that couples orthogonal experiment design with ML techniques to quantify the criticality of TOF and rank them against building-envelope factors.

The techno-economic analysis revealed profitability indicators of 6.4-year payback period, 819 USD net present value, and 8.9 % internal rate of return from pollutant shadow price, carbon credits, and biogas selling. The life cycle assessment (LCA) observations exhibited minimal impacts on toxicity, eutrophication, acidification, human health, and ecosystem quality at the midpoint/endpoint hierarchy levels. The proposed DHS-based plant could fulfil sustainable development goals (SDGs), primarily SDG#3 by reducing water-borne disease, SDG#6 by enhancing water availability, SDG#13 by minimizing the carbon footprint issue, and SDG#14 by conserving aquatic environment. This study depicted that the techno-financial analysis and LCA tools could be integrated with the design and optimization strategies of DHS, offering insights into profitability and holistic management approaches in sustainable wastewater treatment. Because energy utilization for pumps’ operation emerged as a critical factor influencing the overall LCA score, future investigations should employ biogenic sources for electricity supply and apply artificial intelligence techniques to optimize the equipment operation mode that could reduce the expected CO2 emissions. Further studies would also consider expanding the inventory data size, incorporating additional operating factors, and validating the LCA outputs experimentally.

AB  - Climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) is crucial to understand how different regions, communities, and ecosystems are susceptible to the impacts of climate change. Through the identification of vulnerabilities, policymakers can prioritize adaptation efforts, allocate resources effectively, and develop risk mitigation strategies. Social and environmental scientists can design solutions for the development of climate-resilient regions. Nowadays, various approaches have been made available for CCVA, leading to increased knowledge along with the identification of challenges and pitfalls. Participatory approaches are required for the proper selection of vulnerability indicators and the interpretation of the assessment results, accompanied by the development of quality data assessment processes to reduce inconsistencies and uncertainties in the provided data. Openness and interoperability of data and processes have to be promoted to enable the extensibility, reproducibility and comparability of the produced results. In the current work, we develop a framework to enable open and interoperable CCVA, taking advantage of a knowledge management infrastructure and specifically a Knowledge Graph that tracks information for various indicators around the Sustainable Development Goals. We follow an indicator-based vulnerability assessment approach for various temporal and spatial scales, while considering hazard-independent and hazard-dependent analysis. Indicative analysis results are provided in national, regional and local scale.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) systems are becoming increasingly complex due to heterogeneity of devices and requirements for real-time processing and decision making. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies provide powerful capabilities for endowing IoT devices with intelligent services, leading to the so-called Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). The operator is in the middle of this complexity, trying to understand the situation and make effective real-time decisions. Hence, human factors, especially cognitive ones, are a major issue to be addressed. The human cognitive part must be framed together with intelligent artefacts, requiring a systematic approach in the domain of joint cognitive systems. New software development methods in the form of assistants and wizards are necessary to help operators to be context-aware and reduce their technical workload regarding coding or computer-oriented skills, focusing on the task or service at hand. Building on previous research on the role of the human worker in an AIoT environment, this article analyses the described situation in terms of human cyber–physical systems, with the aim of proposing a conceptual framework for these assistance systems at the cognitive level. Two illustrative examples are described to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in collaborative tasks.

AB  - Millions of tons of waste plastic are generated worldwide every year. These waste plastics are nonbiodegradable and are inappropriately disposed thereby constituting sanitary and environmental nuisance to society. The discarded plastics are dumped into drainages and water bodies where they pollute the environment, contaminate aquatic habitats, and harm aquatic animals. Researchers have devised techniques for converting waste plastic to biofuels to replace the dangerous fossil-based fuels and meet the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of affordable and clean energy for all targets. This study reviews the strategies for achieving affordable and clean energy through the conversion of waste plastic to biofuels and other value-added products. The classes of plastics and their applications, waste plastic conversion routes and their products, and conversion of waste plastic to bio-oil, biohydrogen, and other renewable fuels are examined. The application of waste plastic in the building and construction industries, production of carbon nanotubes, synthesis of graphene nanosheets as novel biocatalyst, and wastewater treatment are also discussed with a view to exposing other avenues for the utilization of waste plastic. The outcome of this intervention will enrich scholarship by providing updated information on the strategies for converting waste plastic to biofuels and other value-added products. Biofuel researchers, waste managers, environmental enthusiasts, and other stakeholders will be equipped with adequate knowledge on opportunities available in the waste plastic conversion and how to turn the menace of waste plastic into beneficial products. Implementable legislations and policies to encourage investments into waste conversion for cleaner environment, employment generation, and biodiversity. More targeted interdisciplinary studies are required to evolve innovative pathways for sustainable conversion and utilization of waste plastic. The use of appropriate state-of-the-art technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc. as well as statistical modeling, and optimization tools are needed to improve the conversion efficiency, optimize process parameters, and guarantee the sustainable production of quality products from waste plastic towards meeting SDG 7.

AB  - Continued depletion of fossil-based energy resources, environmental concerns, and the necessity to assuage the ever-increasing global energy demand have resulted in efforts to find sustainable and renewable energy sources. Biodiesel, a variety of liquid biofuel, is a feasible renewable energy option to stem the growing emission of toxic emissions and promote energy sustainability. The need to update existing knowledge on the intensification of biodiesel production by deploying appropriate novel technologies makes the current study imperative. This study reviews the application of computational technologies for the transesterification of WCO into biodiesel. The study gives an overview of the generation, collection, pretreatment, and transesterification techniques for WCO, and the deployment of computation technologies in the transesterification process. The development and deployment of computational technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVMs), and genetic algorithms (GA) for biodiesel synthesis are discussed. Using inputs such as process parameters and fatty composition, AI, ML, ANN, SVMs, and GA are applied to optimize the transesterification process, predict biodiesel properties, and increase biodiesel yield. The application of computational technologies eliminates trial and error, prevents materials and time wastage, ensures the production of quality biodiesel, and guarantees high biodiesel yield. With appropriate policy formulation and implementation, government funding and support, and future collaborative research, computational technologies hold enormous opportunities in biodiesel processing, energy security, and sustainability.

AB  - The advancement of digital technologies and the pursuit of higher-value solutions have driven companies to expand their portfolios with smart products and digital services, resulting in the innovation known as 'digital servitization.' This concept merges servitization —integrating services with products— and digitization —enhancing operations through digital technologies. While previous research has examined digital servitization and smart technologies, a gap remains in understanding how Artificial Intelligence (AI) specifically supports various types of digital servitization across both back-office and front-office activities. This study addresses this gap by investigating how AI enhances digital servitization through six case studies of companies implementing AI-driven servitized solutions. Adopting a capability theoretical perspective, we analyze the application of AI in both back-office and front-office activities for the delivery of base, intermediate, and advanced services. Our findings reveal that AI's role varies by service type, affecting customer interactions and operational tasks differently. We present a theoretical framework with five propositions that elucidate how AI capabilities enhance digital servitization. This framework gives scholars a refined understanding of AI's roles beyond the generalized black box approach and offers practitioners practical insights on leveraging AI for digital transformation.

Based on the integrated platform, and quantitatively studies the impact of the climate change and reservoir operation on the runoff of lower reaches of the Lancing-Mekong river in different scenarios. The results show that: In the next twenty years, both of climate change and reservoir operation will lead to a drop of the runoff. Of all the factors of Lancang-Mekong river runoff decrease, reservoir operation contributes to 12% and climate change 88%, so the major cause of the change of the runoff is climate change. In the impact factors of climate change, the contribution rate of temperature change accounts for 81% and precipitation change 19%. It's believed that the most important influence factor of the lower reaches of the Lancang-Mekong river runoff is temperature change.

AB  - With the effects of climate change, natural disasters are becoming more severe and frequent. Disaster resistant structures play a vital role in preventing loss of lives and damage to the belongings. A suitable material that could resist the forces of nature needs to be selected to ensure safety while reducing the adverse effects on the environment. Turning waste material into raw material is welcomed as the scarcity of natural resources and disposal of waste are becoming major issues nowadays. Such a method of replacing coarse aggregate with 100% recycled Expanded-polystyrene (EPS) is the production of lightweight concrete wall panels. A new trend of lightweight panels can be widely seen as partitions in reinforced concrete frame buildings. Incorporating these panels as a load-bearing element would lead to a drastic change in the industry. Hence a detailed study has been carried out to find out the properties of EPS panels with respect to embodied energy and carbon footprint. A comparative study has been conducted between two-storied refuge space with lightweight load-bearing panels and conventional materials such as cement blocks and fired clay bricks, through which the potential of lightweight wall panels as load-bearing walls for a two-storied refuge space is assessed.

AB  - This paper describes an automatic blue ice extent mapping technique in Grove Mountains, East Antarctica, where the key focused area of the Antarctic scientific expedition and many meteorites are distributed. In previous studies, the monitoring of blue ice extent was usually conducted using satellite images with coarse spatial resolution or offline operation, which lowered the description performance of blue ice in detail as well as the efficiency of continent-scale data production. Using Google Earth Engine, we first developed an automated framework that employs Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) indices in joint with the Otsu thresholding method to distinguish blue ice areas on Landsat imagery. Taking Grove Mountains as a study case, we further analyzed the annual variability of blue ice extent in the austral summer from 2007 to 2021. The results indicated that the blue ice extent can be automatically detected based on cloud platform and has no significant variability trend in Grove Mountains over the study period fluctuating with an overall average area of 440~600 km2. This framework is expected to be used for automated mapping on the whole of Antarctica and other concentrated blue ice areas (e.g., the East Antarctica ice sheet periphery and the Transantarctic Mountains surroundings) in a rapid and efficient manner, which provides guidance on the meteorite recovery and the support of the polar sustainable development goals.

AB  - Energy theft is a significant global issue affecting enterprises involved in electricity transmission and distribution, as many users fail to pay for electricity, jeopardizing the financial stability and profitability of power providers. To address this issue, a cost-effective smart energy theft detection and prevention system is proposed, using microprocessors and GSM technology to remotely detect and stop theft. The system uses an Arduino Nano, NODEMCU V3, Wi-Fi module, relay module, LCD, and current sensors to monitor electrical flow and detect theft. Additionally, a mobile application is developed to enable real-time monitoring and swift detection of electricity theft through its user-friendly interface. Upon detection, the system triggers an alarm with a 3-second delay and temporarily cuts off electricity along the affected path. The implementation of the proposed electricity theft detection and prevention system is essential for a reliable and secure electricity supply, allowing for timely intervention against unauthorized usage through the analysis of current levels in specific areas.

AB  - The versatility and diverse applications of IoT-based Heterogeneous WSN (HWSN) technologies make them valuable tools for achieving sustainability goals in Sustainable Smart Cities (SSCs). Proper management of underlying heterogeneous architecture is crucial for the successful operation of smart applications. To prolong the WSN’s lifespan and avoid failures, effective energy management is essential. Although researchers are continually exploring heterogeneity in WSN, it gets more and more important to create cost-effective paradigms that cover multiple facets of SSC while ensuring their stability and reliability. The concept of Dominating Sets (DS) in a graph can be leveraged to minimize resource utilization in WSNs by arranging nodes into disjoint DS, with only one set executing duties at any given time. In this work, we propose a novel technique for IoT-based HWSNs-enabled SSC, called EADDSA, utilizing the DS concept to plan the sleep-and-awake scheme for heterogeneous nodes, based on their resource capabilities. We propose a new algorithm, called the Energy Attentive Algorithm (EAA), to find disjoint DSs that are energy-aware. EAA algorithm attentively tries to form the set that maximizes lifespan while adhering to DS conditions in each iteration. EADDSA further incorporates an effective DS scheduling strategy to enhance the HWSN lifetime by establishing operational guidelines for each round, taking into account the estimated lifetimes and the designated number of working rounds for each DS. This enables efficient allocation of data sensing and gathering tasks across the network minimizes resource usage, and extends network lifetime.

AB  - The need for a sustainable future and growing concerns about climate change have fueled the global push toward adopting green energy. This research presents critical success factors (CSFs) contributing to adopting sustainable green energies. This article outlines a portfolio of methodologies such as exploratory factor analysis, tradeoff analysis, evidential reasoning algorithm, fuzzy set theory, and expected utility theory for assessing the importance of the success factors of green energy. The study reveals that “infrastructural development,” “research and development,” “green practices for procurement,” and “enabling advanced technologies” are some of the most important factors contributing to green energy adoption in India. Furthermore, the study conducts a tradeoff analysis to determine the importance and changing behaviors of CSFs. Studying factors of green energy adoption empowers managers to integrate sustainability and renewable energy goals into their organizations’ strategic planning, enabling informed decision-making, effective resource allocation, and long-term sustainability. The results of the tradeoff analysis bring out scenarios and the factors that require specific attention due to these unique scenarios.

AB  - Africa faces a unique set of challenges and opportunities in its quest for sustainable energy development and in correspondence with the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 agenda set by the United Nations. The SubSaharan African (SSA) region, in particular, has rich renewable energy potential, including plentiful solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and hydropower resources. In spite of these abundant green resources, the region grapples with energy poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and a heavy reliance on traditional biomass, contributing to environmental degradation and health issues. Recognizing the urgency of addressing the imminent energy crisis, this paper conducts a thought-provoking analysis of renewable energy policies in SSA. It focuses primarily on the strategies that four major SSA countries have adopted, their success stories and the challenges ahead with reference to renewable energy uptake. It also explores the potential policy pathways toward establishing a sustainable and inclusive renewable energy landscape. Drawing on a wide array of scholarly literature, government reports, regulatory mechanisms, policy frameworks and international organization publications, this paper offers delicate insights into the complex nature of renewable energy development in SSA and highlights opportunities for future interventions.

AB  - With a constant rise in the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas causing an adverse effect on the environment, the review of numerous studies and actions were initiated to deal with the issue of global warming. While the industries and transportation are commonly recognized as the main contributors for the cause of CO2 emissions. It is also important to note the significance of CO2 emissions in the residential areas can’t be overlooked. This study focuses on detail analysis of CO2 emissions from the residential areas, its sources and influencing factors for the implementation of sustainable development in the urban areas. This study reviews about the sources of the CO2 emissions from the buildings and its key variables affecting them, which includes heating, cooling, cooking and electricity consumption through an extensive literature survey and more detailed investigations. This study also addresses the influences of CO2, such as occupant behavior, building design and insulation, and its necessary actions taken to improve the energy efficiency. The findings highlight the significant environmental impact of residential emissions, including the contribution to atmospheric CO2 concentration and the acceleration of climate change. Moreover, this study undergoes the potential for mitigation strategies in residential areas, including energy efficiency improvements, adoption of renewable energy sources, behavior change programs, and policy interventions. The outcomes of this study provide valuable information for policy-makers, town planners, and shareholders to develop targeted initiatives that effectively reduce CO2 emissions from residential buildings. By implementing energy-conserving techniques, supporting green initiatives, spreading consciousness among residents, a transition towards low-carbon residential areas can be achieved. Such a shift holds the potential to contribute to broader climate goals, improve air quality, and enhance the overall sustainability of urban environments.

AB  - The energy sector is a major contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels in the energy supply chain. According to scientific reports, there is an international focus on doubling the average annual rate of global energy efficiency improvements between 2023 and 2030. This is critical for meeting the rapidly growing global energy demand and maintaining the Earth's average surface temperature within the target level. Thus, there will be large investments and great opportunities in the field of energy efficiency. It is critical to develop human capital to succeed in achieving these ambitious targets in the energy sector. This paper provides a roadmap for creating a multidisciplinary course to teach the fundamentals of energy efficiency. The course objectives, motivations, learning outcomes, content, learning resources and pedagogical tools are presented.

AB  - The emerging utilization of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Fog computing centers as an Internet virtual computing commodity is raising concerns over the energy consumptions of networked data centers for the support of delay-sensitive applications. In addition to the energy consumed by the servers, the energy wasted by the network devices that support TCP/IP reliable inter-Virtual Machines (VMs) connections is becoming a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose and develop a framework for the joint characterization and optimization of TCP/IP SaaS Fog data centers that utilize a bank of queues for increasing the fraction of the admitted workload. Our goal is two-fold: (i) we maximize the average workload admitted by the data center; and, (ii) we minimize the resulting networking-plus-computing average energy consumption. For this purpose, we exploit the Lyapunov stochastic optimization approach, in order to design and analyze an optimal (yet practical) online joint resource management framework, which dynamically performs: (i) admission control; (ii) dispatching of the admitted workload; (iii) flow control of the inter-VM TCP/IP connections; (iv) queue control; (v) up/down scaling of the processing frequencies of the instantiated VMs; and, (vi) adaptive joint consolidation of both physical servers and TCP/IP connections. The salient features of the resulting scheduler (e.g., the Q* scheduler) are that: (i) it admits distributed and scalable implementation; (ii) it provides deterministic bounds on the instantaneous queue backlogs; (iii) it avoids queue overflow phenomena; and, (iv) it effectively tracks the (possibly unpredictable) time-fluctuations of the input workload, in order to perform joint resource consolidation without requiring any a priori information and/or forecast of the input workload. Actual energy and delay performances of the proposed scheduler are numerically evaluated and compared against the corresponding ones of some competing and state-of-the-art schedulers, under: (i) Fast - Giga - 10Giga Ethernet switching technologies; (ii) various settings of the reconfiguration-consolidation costs; and, (iii) synthetic, as well as real-world workloads. The experimental results support the conclusion that the proposed scheduler can achieve over 30% energy savings.

AB  - Background Food quality is a multifaceted, evolving concept encompassing various aspects throughout the production chain. The shift from traditional analytics to comprehensive strategies is driven by the need to meet this extended quality definition. Scope and approach Foodomics, specifically focusing on connecting chemical composition to sensory properties, is vital for comfort foods like coffee, cocoa, and tea, chosen for enjoyment rather than nutrition. In foodomics, larger and more complex datasets demand Artificial intelligence-based tools for decoding encrypted information. Key findings and conclusions Global coffee, cocoa, and tea supply involve numerous small farms affected by socio-political instability and climate change. Financial motives drive fraudulent practices, leading to unfair competition, loss of consumer confidence, and safety issues. AI-based tools enhance data understanding for knowledge gain, but challenges include the misalignment between academia and industry, limited industrial samples for AI application, academic training gaps, algorithm complexity, and decision-making misinterpretation.

AB  - Despite the fact that most of the data centers are software-defined, the multifaceted network architecture and increase in network traffic make data centers to suffer from overhead. Multipath TCP supports multiple paths for a single routing session and ensures proper utilization of bandwidth over all available links. As rise in number of nodes in data center is frequent and drastic, scalability issue limits the performance of many existing techniques. Segment Routing is vibrant in reducing scalability disputes and routing overhead. Segment routing approach combined with MPTCP traffic result in efficient routing approach. The downfall of the link capacity due to drastic incoming traffic remains as a major concern in data center network which enforces preventing link energy depletion due to high network traffic. Our proposed work, segment routing based energy aware routing approach for software defined data center aims to achieve throughput maximization through preserving link residual capacity and proper utilization of links. As well, our approach shows a decrease in length of segment label stack with respect to maximum segment label depth. Analysis is done by comparing the executions of other existing approaches in a single-controller environment with our energy-aware routing approach in a distributed environment. Distributed controller setup prevents network from single point of failure. It helps to prevent controller overhead and provides improved network performance through throughput.

AB  - Climate Change is the most important challenge that humanity faces today. The rapid increase in global temperatures during the last century due to an exponential increase of greenhouse gas concentrations is altering the climate beyond our capacity of adaptation. In order to mobilize the society towards bold, informed, coherent responses, public institutions should work together to raise awareness of the problem. The University must have a leading role in Climate Change communication, education and research in order to improve our capacity for Climate Change mitigation and adaptation. Climate Change is a complex problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach.In this paper we discuss the role of the university in front of this planetary issue. We discuss the challenges and opportunities that the university has as a source of knowledge through research but also as educators of a new generation that will be left to deal with this issue. At the University of Salamanca, we have launched a series of seminars titled "The University facing the challenges of Climate Change". This initiative aimed to create a dialogue involving multiple parties (academics, local community and the general public) as a way to exchange ideas and look for possible strategies to tackle Climate Change. The format of the seminar, including a face to face discussion between the parties and a virtual platform (Youtube channel), enhances the impact of our initiative. Additionally, the usage of digital media for Climate Change education and communication is discussed. Due to the widespread lack of materials in Spanish, this seminar, up to date and in an accessible format, is a powerful tool for Climate Change communication and education.

AB  - Mass individualization is calling for a more sustainable manufacturing paradigm which can address the paradoxes of diversity, complexity, and affordability. Social Manufacturing (SM) represents a democratized servitization trend trying to reshape the traditional production relationship between consumers and manufacturers. To achieve the SM visions, new operational mechanisms for SM should be constructed to overcome the challenges of information sharing, accuracy, efficiency, security, sovereignty, etc. The survey found that task assignment (TA) is one of the foundational mechanisms for the implementation of regular autonomous manufacturing systems, as well as the role of TA is further amplified for distributed collaborative environments. Therefore, inspired by the relevant research of management science, Platform-based Task Assignment (PBTA) is proposed to distinguish and conceptualize this different research topic. In SM platforms, the diverse capacities and resources can be shared, so that knowing "who can do” and “select whom to do" is more important than knowing "how to do". Furthermore, the studies on TA for SM present a difference from the previous studies on TA in manufacturing. From a perspective of supply-demand mapping, PBTA illustrates the foundational operational mechanism for SM attracting many researchers’ attention from different fields. Meanwhile, research on PBTA is also required for the platform practices in the era of digital, shared, and platform economy. Given the academic importance and practical value, this survey carefully selects 250 valuable research articles relevant to PBTA for SM. A novel workflow model and knowledge framework, namely PBTA4SM, is proposed to identify and organize the critical issues and challenges. This study shows the state-of-the-art research advancement of PBTA including task design considerations, modelling methods, typical engineering problems, algorithms, decision patterns, key activities, and governance mechanisms. Finally, we complete this holistic survey by highlighting eight potential directions for future research in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) era.

AB  - As urban areas rapidly expand, they grapple with multifaceted issues such as population growth, climate change, land shortage, resource constraints, and social inequalities. Proactive planning for the future is essential to foster the development of sustainable and resilient cities capable of adapting to evolving needs. One such needs is designing for death in the urban future, given the outdated, polluting, cumbersome, and unsustainable methods currently in use. Drawing inspiration from theories of social space, hybrid space, and the historical concept of the necropolis, while integrating technological advancements such as extended reality, super artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biodegradable materials, and Web 4.0, this study aims to reimagine the design for death in the urban future through three alternative scenarios. Integrating technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution into speculative design approach, experts' evaluation identifies Necropolis 4.0 as the closest scenario to the ideal solution. Findings serve a dual purpose. First, focusing on Necropolis 4.0, establishes a nature-human-machine relationship and paves the way for designers, planners, and policymakers to envision a novel, green, and sustainable design for death in the urban future. Second, methodological contribution of this research enhances the way we use speculative design approach in urban planning.

The current study investigates the role of nuclear energy consumption to unveil contextual information and report novel evidence concerning the significance of energy and environmental policies. This research is a novel attempt to outline methodological and topical contributions, thematic analysis, co-citation analysis, and country-collaboration analysis. As energy and environmental solutions have been prioritized within sustainable development goals, our research approach would allow policymakers and researchers to understand the extent to which nuclear energy can provide solutions towards environmental sustainability and identify research limitations to overcome by future studies. Moreover, our extensive analysis allows us to argue that nuclear energy impacts energy demand and is the most critical factor in fulfilling environmental commitments under regional and international environmental agreements.

AB  - Green purchasing in green supply chain management (GSCM) literature plays an essential role in achieving carbon neutrality by seeking to eliminate CO2 emissions. Single organizations would, however, not aim at such a goal if it is to their economic detriment. GSCM research streams highlight that the successful implementation of environmental considerations leads to better economic performance in the long term. Therefore, this paper aims to identify and analyze suppliers that exhibit both environmental and economic success, indicating an effective and efficient realization of their sustainability measures. Given the long-term horizon of the research problem, we differentiate from previous microeconomic research by taking a macro perspective on sustainable supplier analysis, which investigates macroeconomic indicators focusing on firms' revenues. The above-described economic and environmental efficiency is analyzed in a multiple case study using sustainability reports from 66 OEM suppliers as well as data on their revenues and ratings on their carbon pollution measured by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). First, a text mining inspired quantitative sustainable SWOT analysis is performed to evaluate the long-term strategy of organizations. A subsequent data envelopment analysis aims to identify efficient suppliers and causes for their efficiency. The overall results not only outline sustainable suppliers but also give insights into suppliers that may become sustainable in the future. We further show that large organizations struggle with meeting environmental expectations, whereas low-to-medium-sized suppliers tend to be more economically and environmentally efficient.. Based on the results, we discuss implications both for management research and practice.

Three exemplary cases were selected to illustrate various elements: (1) An application supporting radiologists in stroke-care (2) A natural language processing application for clinical data abstraction (3) An ICU-discharge decision-making application. Results A total of 31 policy documents and 9 academic publications were selected, from which a list of 29 issues was distilled. The issues were grouped by four focus areas: (1) Technology & Performance, (2) Human & Organizational, (3) Legal & Ethical and (4) Transparency & Usability. Each assessment element was extensively discussed in the test, and the elements clinical effectiveness, clinical workflow, workforce, interoperability, fairness and explainability were further highlighted through the exemplary cases. Conclusion The current methodology of HTA requires extension to make it suitable for a broad evaluation of medical AI technologies. The 29-item assessment list that we propose needs a tailored approach for distinct types of medical AI, since the conceptualisation of the issues differs across applications.

AB  - This paper discusses a PhD research project testing the hypothesis that using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) [18] as explicit inputs to drive the Software Requirements Engineering process will result in requirements with improved sustainability benefits. The research has adopted the Design Science Research Method (DSRM) [21] to test a process named SDG Assessment for Requirements Elicitation (SDGARE). Three DSRM cycles are being used to test the hypothesis in safety-critical, high-precision, software-intensive systems in aerospace and healthcare. Initial results from the first two DSRM cycles support the hypothesis. However, these cycles are in a plan-driven (waterfall) development context and future research agenda would be a similar application in an Agile development context.

AB  - Product diversity is increasing as a result of changing consumer behavior and diversification in global markets. For manufacturing companies, this development means an increase in the complexity of the required production systems and all company processes involved. Digitalization can make a decisive contribution to mastering this complexity and also offers a number of approaches to conserve resources and avoid waste at all levels of the organization. Simulations in the product development can help to optimize the material usage. The simulation of logistics and production processes helps to avoid waste in the material flow. The increasing use of low-cost sensors enables comprehensive data to be obtained on material movements and energy consumption. These data can be evaluated via big data analyses in order to develop approaches for the control and regulation of material flows and energy consumption. The visualization of data in energy management systems brings transparency, which shows new approaches for optimization. In order to improve one’s own competitiveness through digitalization a strategic approach is required. Several models and tools are available for the development of a company-wide strategy for digitalization. The Lower Saxony Learning Factory for Resource Efficiency (“NiFaR“) has analyzed models and tools to use them for suitable applications in the production environment of the Factory. By using sensor technology and artificial intelligence and by visualizing the results, NiFaR enables its visitors to experience and comprehend the potential of digitalization for the purpose of resource efficiency. It also offers training on this topic for consultants and employees of companies, ranging from the presentation of different digitalization approaches to practical implementation examples.

AB  - This study investigates household decisions regarding adoption of solar panels and plug-in electric vehicles in the United States (CA, CO, FL, MA, MN, TX, VA). Although the adoption of each technology is well-documented, the dynamics of their co-adoption have been understudied. This study uses Theory of Consumption Values to investigate co-adoption decisions. Employing qualitative interviews with co-adopters and single technology adopters, this research uncovers underlying motivations and challenges associated with co-adoption. The study reveals that co-adoption is primarily driven by a blend of functional, emotional, social, epistemic, and conditional values. Key findings indicate that direct connections between the adoption of electric vehicles and solar (conditional value) are uncommon. Instead, many co-adoption decisions are made independently, guided by overlapping consumption values. The study also identifies challenges to co-adoption, including cost, lack of knowledge, and perceived technology incompatibilities. These insights contribute to the broader understanding of complementarity in sustainable technology adoption by households. They also highlight the need for approaches that address identified barriers and facilitate the transition of single adopters to co-adopters.

AB  - Smart surveillance is crucial for improving citizen security and ensuring a sustainable environment for routine tasks, particularly within intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, it can be costly and burden taxpayers. The lack of public interaction makes it difficult for police to arrest and conduct investigations. Additionally, incidents increase due to similar patterns, making smart surveillance essential for reporting and addressing these issues. Smart devices such as sensors or actuators installed on the roads and within vehicles are critical components of any smart surveillance and ITS framework. This integration enhances system agility and facilitates proactive rather than reactive responses. It empowers security agencies to plan more effectively and respond swiftly during emergencies. The incorporation of cloud computing capabilities transforms traditional surveillance and ITS operations. Employing the Internet of Things (IoT) with edge or cloud computing extensions, such as fog computing, modernizes the management of security gadgets for Field Forces. This study investigates a smart surveillance fog-enabled approach to reduce response times for aiding agencies within ITS. By optimizing individual journeys through an RFID-based passing system, incidents are reported promptly to the nearest field force, enhancing overall ITS efficiency. The proactive approach improves resource consumption (energy, CPU, and network usage) compared to traditional reactive methods. The fog-enabled experiments demonstrated a CPU efficiency of approximately 95.76%, significantly outperforming the Cloud-only deployment, achieving a maximum average efficiency of 92.12%. Experimental evaluations in a simulation environment demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional approaches, marking a substantial advancement in IoT-aided ITS.

AB  - In smartcard-based travel payment systems, passengers have to place the smartcard near the journey registration devices once each for check-in and check-out to authenticate their travel. This is an annoying process when if the journey involves multiple stops. In this paper, we describe a working system of secure energy-efficient automatic ticketing (SEAT) for public transport, which transforms traditional check-in/check-out system into Be-in/Be-out system. In SEAT, a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) enabled smartphone communicates with registration devices to track the journey for pricing without any human intervention. SEAT is vigilant toward the energy consumption of the BLE device under various conditions, and security and privacy threats to the overall ecosystem. We develop models for energy consumption and latency for BLE devices under the influence of mutual interference based on experiments with 32 BLE devices. We utilize these models to develop an energy-efficient protocol for SEAT that is secure and privacy preserving. Our experiments show that a BLE module consumes only 18.3 J daily under the proposed system model, which is less than 0.1% of the total capacity of a typical smartphone battery.

AB  - A circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from the use of virgin resources by using them more efficiently through the transition to a more sustainable production and consumption pattern that involves enterprises and all stakeholders. The innovative business models of the circular economy facilitate a change in consumer attitudes from the throw-away mentality of the traditional `take-make-dispose' linear economy toward a circular one. Consumption behavior of consumers in the circular economic system plays an important role in mitigating environmental degradation and resource depletion, driving economic opportunities globally, promoting local job creation and engender energy independence. However, the shift to the new economic model requires the collaboration of all stakeholders. Humankind has exploited the earth' natural resources with our relentless demands on the ecosystem, which now exceeds nature's regenerative capacity. This paper explores the consumer attitudes and behaviors toward the notion of the circular economy through the implementation of different innovative business models in different parts of Europe. The results demonstrate that the design of the circular business model should take into account the difference in consumption behaviors of different cultures to increase consumers' acceptance of the concept of circular economy and subsequently enhance resource efficiency to achieve the possible goal of sustainable development.

AB  - The concept of circular economy (CE) significantly lessen the waste and environment pollution. A growing number of articles support the need to consider implementing CE within supply chains. Unfortunately, most corporations have not been successful in pursuing this goal, greatly due to existence of several challenges. Up to now, limited articles have analyzed the challenges to CE practices in the leather sector context. To address this issue, this paper introduces a decision support framework for investigating the interdependencies among challenges to CE practices in the leather industry context using Rough-based Decision-Making Trail and Evaluation Laboratory (Rough DEMATEL) technique. According to the results of the study “lack of financial support from authorities” is the most pressing challenge that impede CE implementation. Findings can assist industrial decision-makers to focus on the challenges to CE practices and employ effective strategies and solutions for moving the leather industry towards sustainable development.

AB  - Soil stabilisation is crucial to tackle the problem of land disasters, such-as landslide, slope failure, and debris flow among others, which may occur naturally or as a result of human actions. Many people are displaced from their homes and some even lose their life in such disasters. Mauritius has not been spared by these major issues and, as a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) which is found under the tropics, the island is at a high risk of cyclones and torrential rains which may induce further land disasters. Another problem occurring worldwide is the landfill scarcity to dispose human, commercial, and industrial solid waste. The facilities for recycling municipal solid waste (MSW) in the country are very limited. Chemical stabilisation could potentially help solve both issues by combining binders with waste products to stabilise the soils in landslide-prone areas. The goal of this paper was to investigate the scope for an economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable solution to help mitigate the negative geotechnical events which come with climate change and also reducing the environmental problem of disposal and landfill scarcity. It was found that plastic wastes (14% of MSW), textile wastes (6% of MSW) and glass wastes (3% of MSW) in Mauritius were largely unrecycled and could partially be used in soil stabilisation.

AB  - The increasing volume of ocean traffic, global warming and climate change have raised the urgency of the shipping industry to prioritize their efforts in sustainability. The shipping industry is currently under significant pressure to comply with stricter environmental regulations in order to operate in a cleaner and greener approach. Hence, this study aims to promote a sustainable shipping industry that is able to strike a balance between their economic, social and environmental performance. As such, this research intends to focus on the sustainability of the shipping companies by introducing green shipping practices (GSP) to help shipping companies to achieve sustainability based on the triple bottom line framework. GSP is not only limited to one aspect of the business operations, but it also includes the entire shipping industry. This study conceptualizes GSP for shipping companies within six dimensions, which are company policy and procedure, shipping documentation, shipping equipment, shipping service providers’ cooperation, shipping materials and shipping design for compliance. This research also introduces the role of rational culture as a moderator in facilitating sustainability that yields business benefits.

But the article focuses on sustainable ambitions that comprehensively cover three areas: Environment, Material, and Humankind. For a depth understanding of these three areas with detailed examples, the automotive industry has been selected. Though the article revolves around only one specific industry, the approach can be replicated to the supply chain of any industry with some modifications based on the value chain of that particular industry. This article aims to develop a transport solution cleaner, safer and circular, together with the supply chain partners and stakeholders. This article includes the research and methodologies that have been followed to date for these three areas but in silos. Later on, the article shows how these three areas can be integrated and can be the way toward a sustainable supply chain and how the gap among these goals can be filled.

AB  - Monitoring rice yield is crucial for sustainable and resilient agricultural systems and global supply chains that ensure worldwide food security. Optical vegetation indices (OVIs) are significant parameters for predicting rice yield via remote sensing. Previous studies show that radar vegetation indices (RVIs) exhibit correlations with OVIs and vegetation water content. However, research on RVIs' integration into rice yield prediction is currently in its preliminary stage. In this study, rice yield prediction was completed using RIVs and the XGBoost regression model. Sentinel-1 VH/VV polarization data and county-level rice statistics covering Guangdong Province, China, spanning from 2017–2021 were used. The experiment results demonstrated that the rice yield prediction performance of RVIs was comparable to that of OVIs. In early rice yield prediction, the R2 was 0.54 and the RMSE was 259.03 kg/ha based on RVIs. In late rice yield prediction, the R2 was 0.69 and the RMSE was 405.21 kg/ha based on RVIs. The experimental results demonstrated the excellent applicability of the RVIs for rice yield prediction, with potential contributions to global sustainable development.

AB  - The exponential rise in global population and pollution from industrialization exacerbates water scarcity. Solar desalination offers a carbon-neutral solution to freshwater production. The V-type double-sloped solar desalination system, renowned for its simplicity and compact size, outperforms single-sloped systems. This study compares the performance of a double inward slope desalination still with and without a flat plate collector. Results show a 74% increase in water production with the modified still, achieving 3020 mL/day and 633 mL/hr on clear, sunny days. Energy efficiency also improves by 18% to 0.13 mL/kJ with the addition of the flat plate collector. Conducted in Thalassery, India, the experiment demonstrates potential for home applications. Shadowing on the collector plate can diminish solar energy gain, addressed through mathematical modeling using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in this study.

AB  - Globally, electric motors are the single biggest converters of electrical energy, accounting for an estimated 45% of the world's electricity usage. Even as the world transitions to more sustainable energy sources, global electricity consumption is anticipated to increase. Improving the efficiency of electric motors is an integral part of reducing the total energy usage, though it only makes up one portion of a motor's total sustainability footprint. From the sourcing of raw materials used to manufacture a motor and their circularity to the greenhouse gases emitted during the transportation of the motor to its final installation site, this paper provides a holistic view of sustainability regarding electric motors and guidance for assuring sustainability in motor selection.

AB  - Tiny machine learning (TinyML) envisions executing a deep neural network (DNN)-based inference on an edge device for improving battery life, latency, security, and privacy. Toward this vision, recent microcontroller units (MCUs) integrate in-memory computing (IMC) hardware to leverage its high energy efficiency and throughput in vector–matrix multiplication (VMM). However, those existing works require large IMC hardware, severely increasing the area overhead. In addition, most existing works use analog–mixed-signal (AMS) IMC hardware, exhibiting limited robustness over process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Finally, none can support a practical software development framework such as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLite-micro). Due to these limitations, those MCUs did not present the performance for the standard benchmark MLPerf-Tiny, which makes it difficult to evaluate them against the state-of-the-art neural (not necessarily IMC-based) MCUs. In this article, we design a new IMC-based MCU, titled iMCU, for TinyML to address those challenges. In the design process, we: 1) define the optimal set of acceleration targets and 2) devise an area-efficient computation flow that requires the least amount of IMC hardware yet still provides a significant acceleration. In addition, we develop: 1) state-of-the-art digital IMC macros and 2) create the accelerator based on the macros, which can support the proposed computation flow in a fully pipelined manner. Combining those innovations, we prototyped the iMCU in a 28-nm CMOS. The measurement results show that the iMCU significantly outperforms the prior IMC-based MCUs in compute density, energy efficiency, and SRAM density (total SRAM size/total SRAM area). It also achieves a compact footprint of 2.73 mm2.

AB  - Electrostatic precipitators are widely recognized as effective air pollution control equipment by environmental protection agencies. These devices utilize high voltage to generate an electrostatic field, causing oil fumes and dust particles to polarize. Through electrostatic attraction, these particles are captured on collector plates, achieving high-efficiency filtration. However, traditional electrostatic precipitators require frequent cleaning and maintenance, leading to operational downtime and increased costs. This study proposes a novel solution: integrating IoT technologies into electrostatic precipitators to create a smart system capable of real-time monitoring and data analysis. Sensors embedded in the system collect data such as sparking frequency, voltage, current, temperature, and air pressure. By leveraging big data analytics, maintenance can be optimized, reducing costs and human effort. This innovation holds significant value for the restaurant industry, ensuring compliance with air pollution laws while improving operational efficiency. Furthermore, this research aligns with global sustainability initiatives, including the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), by advancing eco-friendly technology and addressing critical environmental challenges.

AB  - Desertification and land degradation have remained a huge challenge to the actualization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 in Africa. Given the proposed "Decade on Ecosystem Restoration" (2021-2030), this study examines the restoration approaches and strategies employed to tackle desertification and land degradation, determine the impacts of the strategies employed, examine the factors responsible for unsustainable land restoration, and identify sustainable land restoration approaches in dryland communities in Africa. The study adopted a semi-systematic review of extant literature on land restoration from academic journals, reports, and newsletters from 2000 to 2023. The results show a preponderance of participatory approaches, and use of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK) for land restoration activities in dryland communities in Africa, whereas science-based methods are scarce. Most restoration practices involved biological, surveillance, mechanical, water conservation, climate-smart agriculture, soil fertility restoration strategies and income-generating techniques, but advocacy measures were low. Various restoration projects in Africa, have yielded substantial benefits, including regeneration of vegetation, improved nutrition and income generation among community groups, and benefits vary according to the strategy adopted and the context of project implementation. However, lack of funding, an insecure land tenure system, as well as poor coordination and monitoring of projects constitute huge barriers to land restoration efforts in Africa. We conclude that people-centered projects, social incentives, and income generating ventures are drivers of sustainable land restoration practices in Africa, and more policies and programme implementation are required in the aspect of land restoration advocacy campaigns.

AB  - The transition to a lower-carbon energy system across Europe brings numerous opportunities and challenges, necessitating advancements in sustainable and eco-friendly energy solutions. This study examines the design and operation of distribution networks and microgrids, particularly emphasizing the integration of hybrid AC/DC distribution systems. The primary goals of this integration are to enhance overall system performance and reduce operating expenses. Utilizing DIgSILENT Power Factory software, the research simulates a microgrid at the FOSS Research Center for Sustainable Energy at the University of Cyprus, incorporating real load and PV generation data. In order to reduce the amount of energy imported from the main grid, this approach evaluates various combinations of AC and DC loads, power production units, and energy storage solutions. The results show that the most optimal structure, with 65% DC loads and 35% AC loads, maximizes efficiency as well as minimizes running expenses. The analysis highlights a notable decrease in imported energy, which dropped from 60.3 kWh/day at full AC loads to 51.6 kWh/day at the optimal DC ratio. Finally, the design and implementation of effective, sustainable energy systems that are in line with changing European energy policy and technology breakthroughs will be significantly impacted by these outcomes.

AB  - The proposed framework leverages Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to revolutionize supply chain management by ensuring product authenticity. Each product document stored in a repository is minted as an NFT. The NFT is a digital twin of the product's certification, containing metadata for tracking its origin, authenticity, and key details. When a buyer verifies the product's authenticity, the NFT is burned as a final step, ensuring that the product cannot be re-certified without a new issuance. This framework creates a transparent, tamper-proof, and decentralized system to enhance trust and accountability in the supply chain. By integrating the Ethereum-based Pure Chain network and smart contracts, this solution benefits from high availability, immutability, and the ability to automate key processes. The system verified and retrieved the base URI of a designated product identity (ID) whose NFT was stored in a GitHub repository. A vulnerability check of the smart contract codes with solidcheck.io shows that the smart contracts are 84 % secured with no serious security threats, as all considerations were made in the contract code design.

AB  - Conceptual architectural design is a complex process that draws on past experience and creativity to generate new designs. The application of artificial intelligence to this process should not be oriented toward finding a solution in a defined search space since the design requirements are not yet well defined in the conceptual stage. Instead, this process should be considered as an exploration of the requirements, as well as of possible solutions to meet those requirements. This work offers a tour of major research projects that apply artificial intelligence solutions to architectural conceptual design. We examine several approaches, but most of the work focuses on the use of evolutionary computing to perform these tasks. We note a marked increase in the number of papers in recent years, especially since 2015. Most employ evolutionary computing techniques, including cellular automata. Most initial approaches were oriented toward finding innovative and creative forms, while the latest research focuses on optimizing architectural form.

In spite of that, the complexity of these phenomena and the data involved can result in complex visualization or simplification of the visuals and a consequent data loss. To tackle this topic, we designed an interactive visualization to facilitate the understanding and awareness of the interdependencies and consequences of a complex social/political contemporary phenomenon, such as the war ravaging Ukraine. To this end, we engaged the public through a visualization that presents the interdependencies between the Ukrainian war and climate change in terms of environment, food and raw materials produced and exported, people (refugees and displaced), and support (military, humanitarian, and economic) provided to Ukraine. We evaluated our prototype and found that our visualization increased the users’ awareness of war-affected aspects that directly or indirectly influence climate change, especially for food and people dimensions.

AB  - To coordinate with the evolution of I&T, it is indicated to enhance the number of data center (DC) worldwide, which involves enormous cooling demand that may lead to energy wastage if the facility is not constructed energy-efficiently, impeding decarbonization. Passive radiative cooler (PRC) have exhibited their energy-saving capability in many studies. Being a windowless building, DC has extensive coverage area for PRC comparing to other buildings that require outdoor visual access. The power-saving potential of a dual-layer daytime radiative cooling paint (DDRCC) in a high-rise DC was investigated at multi-building scale using a self-created site model under Hong Kong's humid subtropical climate. Besides the roof, which has been the target PRC-employed surface in previous studies, this work deployed DDRCC on roof and vertical façade of the DC, attaining optimal saving of 652–821 kW and cooling power of 23.4–29.5 W/m2, demonstrating its practicability in high-rise building. DDRCC accomplished cooling power of 2.5–48.0 W/m2 in scenarios with various configuration of PRC-utilized envelope. Additionally, for the site studied, the cooling power of DDRCC enhanced with aspect ratio when the height of adjacent buildings was comparable to the DC. DDRCC was competent to achieve power-saving with walls of different thermal resistances.

AB  - Zeotropic refrigerants possess the characteristic of temperature glide during phase-change process, making them suitable for temperature matching between cold and hot sources and reducing total temperature differences. In this manuscript, the applicability of two commonly used refrigerants, zeotropic refrigerant R407C and pure refrigerant R134a in data center cooling systems are investigated. Firstly, the heat transfer and flow characteristics of R407C and R134a are studied to obtain boiling heat transfer empirical correlations. Secondly, a data center cooling model is established, and modeling calculations are conducted based on experimental results. Finally, the influence of refrigerants on the energy saving effect are calculated based on the model. Experimental results demonstrate that R134a exhibits a 48.3% higher boiling heat transfer coefficient compared to R407C at heat flux 16500 W/m2. However, when considering a data center cooling system, using R407C as working fluid shows the advantage of temperature matching as heat transfer area increases. Based on modeling results, at large heat transfer area, the annual cooling load factor using R407C at low mass flow rate is 0.5% lower than that of using R134a at low mass flow rate, and 22.5% lower than that of using R134a at large mass flow rate for typical climate city Harbin.

AB  - The research investigates CO2 emissions in conjunction with mitigating strategies all throughout the hydrogen energy supply chain to support policies and sustainable frameworks. Focusing on combining wind and solar power into hydrogen generation, the study evaluates carbon absorption and reduction using a simulation-based network model. To reduce lifetime CO2 emissions, key mitigating techniques under analysis are maximizing the mix of renewable energy sources, attaining grid parity for affordable hydrogen generation, and using green supplier selection criteria. Panel data from China enabled researchers to better grasp how policy involvement and value chain participation might help to lower carbon footprints between 2015 and 2024. With an ideal renewable energy balance of 49% wind and 51% solar, the results show that when the country reached grid parity solar energy became the main hydrogen source. Still, lower renewable reliance required a greater 60% solar share. These revelations give legislators evidence-based suggestions for improving sustainability in operations within the hydrogen supply chain.

AB  - Background The healthcare sector has an environmental impact of around 4.6% of global CO2 emissions, contributing to aggravating the climate crisis. However, the impact of the health sector’s emissions on human health is not regularly assessed. We aim to estimate the health burden and associated costs of the health sector’s carbon footprint within the European Union (EU). Methods We calculated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and associated costs based on human health damage factors (DALYs/kg-CO2e) by considering four scenarios. Three scenarios for shared socioeconomic pathways (S1 – high growth, S2 − baseline, and S3 − low growth) represented variations of global society, demographics, and economics until 2100. A fourth scenario (S4) considered the current EU’s 55% reduction goal of greenhouse gas emissions. The healthcare sector’s emissions per capita (in CO2-equivalent) in 2019 were extracted from the Lancet Countdown, and population data were retrieved from Eurostat for the same year. Results In the EU, 365,047 DALYs (95%CI: 194,692–535,403) are expected to be caused by the health sector’s emissions at baseline (S2). In an S1 scenario, the burden would slightly decrease to 316,374 DALYs (95%CI: 170,355–462,393), whereas a S3 scenario would increase 486,730 DALYs (95%CI: 243,365–681,422). If EU’s carbon goals are met, the burden could be substantially reduced to 164,271 DALYs (95%CI: 87,611–240,931). Costs can amount to 25.6 billion euros, when considering DALYs monetisation. Conclusion CO2 emissions from the health sector are expected to significantly impact human health. Therefore, it is important to ensure that EU climate policies for public buildings are in line with the Paris Agreement, increase funding for climate mitigation programs within the healthcare sector, and review clinical practices at the local level.

AB  - Modular air containment (MAC) prototype was developed for optimal row-based cooling system for high-density data centers. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the thermal performance and compare the cooling provisioning of different configurations of row-based cooling system to find the optimum placement of in-row CRAC units. Techno-optimal estimations were performed considering different in-row CRAC placements and aisle layouts. A matrix combination was analyzed based on total 2592 cases that can be implemented. By the whole optimization process of in-row cooler placement, we can achieve the best solution with the statically balanced cooling provisioning with a margin of error of 0.2%. The cooled air from in-row CRAC units was supplied with almost no heat loss in the air distribution paths to each server. Numerical simulations confirmed that the cold-hot-cold (C–H–C) aisle layout can improve the minimum 9% of heat balance for the provisioned CRACs compared to the hot-cold-hot (H–C–H) aisle layout. Temperature distributions, air streamlines and net cooling usages showed that the C–H–C aisle layout has better thermal performance and cooling provisioning especially for the row-based cooling. The C–H–C aisle layout is more proper than the H–C–H aisle layout for achieving the desired cooling efficiency.

AB  - This study aimed to develop an adaptive artificial neural network model (AAM) for the prediction of the rack inlet temperature and cooling system energy, and the optimal control algorithm for cooling system of a containment-type data center. A cyber-physical system (CPS) framework, that incorporated the AAM and control algorithm, was also proposed for the precise control of the data center cooling system. To develop the AAM model and control algorithm, mathematical modeling of a reference physical model was conducted, and training data were acquired from this model. The performance of the proposed AAM and control algorithm was then compared with that of a non-adaptive ANN model (NAAM) in terms of prediction accuracy and control stability. The analysis results indicated that the optimal control algorithm with the AAM exhibited superior prediction accuracy and control stability than the algorithm with the NAAM. In particular, for the AAM-based algorithm under conditions representing a novel data center environment, the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation of the RMSE (CV(RMSE)) for the predicted and actual values were 0.22 °C and 1.02%, respectively, for the inlet rack temperature and 0.19 kW and 0.76% for the cooling system energy. The control was also stable, with an MAE of 0.08 °C and a maximum error of 1.17 °C. Based on this analysis, a CPS-based control strategy incorporating an ANN-based optimal control algorithm is expected to be an effective energy efficiency solution for existing data center without changing IT equipment or cooling systems.

AB  - Aquaculture increases the global economy by enhancing the food security, as well as providing employment, and boost the growth of developing countries. Aquaculture industries are now playing a great important role in the generation of approximately 265$ billion USD annually, that contributes significantly to the economy of the world. Currently one of the most severe risks to aquaculture's economic success is disease, which is well-acknowledged. A wide variety of infectious organisms, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and metazoan parasites, causes lethal microbial infectious diseases in fish. Among all organisms, bacteria are to blame for the overwhelming prevalence of infectious illnesses in fish kept in closed quarters. Moreover, the effectiveness and development of the aquaculture system depend on the early diagnosis of illnesses. Whereas it is an area of computer science that gives us intelligent machines that could learn to mimic the cognitive processes of living creatures and make decisions based on their acquired experiences. While there is an interest in using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools to automate diagnosis. Furthermore, AI advanced tool deep learning (DL) help in fish identification, classification, microbial infectious disease detection, behavioural analysis, size or biomass estimate, and water quality prediction have all been thoroughly examined in smart fish farming with higher accuracy outcomes than conventional approaches. This chapter provides information about the use of advanced AI techniques in the aquaculture industry, focusing on fish disease identification, microbial pathogen detection and diagnosis that affect fish and their characteristics.

AB  - Vehicular delay tolerant network (VDTN) technology uses vehicles on the road as moving nodes to deliver data from source to destination using several intermediate nodes. Efficient data dissemination in VDTN is a difficult problem due to existing trade-offs between several metric variables such as delivery ratio, delay, and overhead ratio. Inclusion of important social network parameters (like community, social strength, trust, friendship, and selfishness) in computation of forwarding probability may help to improve the performance of a routing algorithm. However, different tuning of these parameters results in different outcomes for the metric variables. A proper balancing of these parameters may result in an optimized outcome solving the trade-off between the metric variables. Nonetheless, dependency of the variables on a number of social network parameters and their mutual trade-offs makes this a non-trivial optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to optimize these trade-offs using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The proposed approach provides a set of pareto-optimal solutions also known as non-dominating solutions. Further, based on the requirements of a target application scenario, a specific optimal solution out of the pareto-optimal solution set is delivered using artificial intelligence (AI) technique. The proposed methodology is simulated in a VDTN scenario using the opportunistic network environment (ONE) simulator and Matlab. Furthermore, based on the experimental results, an exhaustive analysis is provided about how the metric variables are affected by the involvement of the social-based parameters. The capabilities of the proposed approach are validated using a statistical comparative analysis of the results. In future, the outcome of the study may play a helpful role to decide the priorities of the network parameters while designing new data dissemination algorithms for VDTN.

AB  - Recently, intelligent computation algorithms have been extended into every field, and the trend of digitization and intelligence in the decision-making system of supply chain management is becoming more and more obvious. In this article, the pricing intelligent optimization management for the duopoly supply chains is considered and the optimal pricing model based on the Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium model is constructed. The corresponding autonomous two-level gradient-based equilibrium algorithm for the pricing management systems is designed to analyze the modeling characteristics of the pricing optimal model with the simulation results. Firstly, the profit models of the retailers and manufacturers are given by analyzing the demand and occurred costs for the duopoly supply chain systems. Based on the above models, the optimal pricing strategy based on the Stackelberg-Nash game are constructed and the corresponding Nash equilibrium (NE) points for the optimal pricing are obtained according to the profit models. Furthermore, the novel two-level gradient-based algorithm for the pricing management systems is designed to obtain the optimal equilibrium points of the unit retail price, unit wholesale price, and length of the replenishment cycle. Finally, the designed gradient-based algorithm is implemented through the simulation, and the optimization characteristics of the game-based optimal model are analyzed. The NE-based optimal prices and the convergence of the proposed algorithm for retailers and manufacturers are illustrated by the simulation results.

The study has involved six recipes of vegetable gels to combine them into three-layer snacks. Hydrocolloid bars were freeze-dried to create porous structure. Two hydrocolloid systems were analysed: sodium alginate with calcium lactate and the mixture of locust bean gum with xanthan gum. Physical properties of obtained samples were studied and the carbon footprint for the production of each freeze-dried vegetables bar was calculated. The type of hydrocolloid has been mainly shown to have a significant impact on the on the physical properties and footprint of investigated snacks.

AB  - Academic and policy proposals on algorithmic accountability often seek to understand algorithmic systems in their socio-technical context, recognising that they are produced by ‘many hands’. Increasingly, however, algorithmic systems are also produced, deployed, and used within a supply chain comprising multiple actors tied together by flows of data between them. In such cases, it is the working together of an algorithmic supply chain of different actors who contribute to the production, deployment, use, and functionality that drives systems and produces particular outcomes. We argue that algorithmic accountability discussions must consider supply chains and the difficult implications they raise for the governance and accountability of algorithmic systems. In doing so, we explore algorithmic supply chains, locating them in their broader technical and political economic context and identifying some key features that should be understood in future work on algorithmic governance and accountability (particularly regarding general purpose AI services). To highlight ways forward and areas warranting attention, we further discuss some implications raised by supply chains: challenges for allocating accountability stemming from distributed responsibility for systems between actors, limited visibility due to the accountability horizon, service models of use and liability, and cross-border supply chains and regulatory arbitrage.

AB  - The training of hospital pharmacists in the coming years must adapt and respond to constant current and future social and technological challenges, without neglecting the basic areas of the profession. It is necessary to acquire knowledge in what is known as digital comprehensive health: artificial intelligence, technology and automation, digital skills, and new forms of communication with patients, such as telemedicine and telepharmacy that are already a reality in many hospitals. We must provide knowledge in automated systems for the distribution and dispensing of medicines, robots for preparing sterile preparations, traceability systems, the use of drones in clinical care, etc. as well as training in the application of technology in pharmaceutical care, through devices and applications that help identify patients who require specific care early and effectively. In this digital scenario, new risks and challenges must be faced, such as cybersecurity and cyber resilience, which makes the training and education of healthcare professionals in general, and hospital pharmacists in particular, inexcusable. On the other hand, the appearance of increasingly complex and innovative therapies has a great impact not only on health population but also on economic and environmental issues, which makes new competencies and skills essential to develop and implement disruptive and competent financing, equity, and sustainability strategies. In this demanding and hyper-connected environment, it is understandable that the well-known “burned out worker syndrome” appears, which prevents the correct personal and professional development of the team and highlights the importance of quality training for its prevention and management. In short, in the next decade, the training of hospital pharmacists must be aimed at providing knowledge in innovation and in basic skills needed to adapt and succeed to current demands and changes. Resumen La formación de los farmacéuticos especialistas de hospital en los próximos años debe adaptarse y dar respuesta a constantes retos sociales y tecnológicos actuales y futuros, sin descuidar las áreas básicas de la profesión. Es necesario adquirir conocimientos en lo que se conoce como salud integral digital: inteligencia artificial, tecnología y automatización, competencias digitales y nuevas formas de comunicación con los pacientes, como la telemedicina y la telefarmacia que ya son una realidad en muchos hospitales. Dotar de conocimientos en sistemas automatizados para la distribución y dispensación de medicamentos, robots de elaboración de preparaciones estériles, sistemas de trazabilidad, el uso de drones en la asistencia clínica, etc., sin olvidar incluir, la capacitación en la aplicación de tecnología en la atención farmacéutica, a través de dispositivos y aplicaciones que ayuden a identificar pacientes que requieren atención específica de forma temprana y eficaz. Ante este escenario digital, aparecen nuevos riesgos y desafíos que afrontar, como la ciberseguridad y la ciberresiliencia, que hace inexcusable la capacitación y formación de los profesionales sanitarios en general, y en particular, de los farmacéuticos especialistas de hospital. Por otro lado, la aparición de terapias cada vez más complejas e innovadoras, tienen un gran impacto no sólo sanitario sino también económico, y medioambiental, que hace imprescindibles nuevas competencias y habilidades que nos permitan desarrollar e implementar estrategias de financiación, equidad y de sostenibilidad disruptivas y competentes. Ante este entorno tan exigente e hiperconectado, es entendible que aparezca el conocido “burnout” o también llamado «síndrome del trabajador quemado» que impide el correcto desarrollo profesional y personal del equipo, y que pone de manifiesto la importancia de una formación de calidad para su prevención y abordaje. En definitiva, en la próxima década, la formación de los farmacéuticos especialistas de hospital debe estar orientada a proveer de conocimiento la innovación y adaptarse a las demandas y cambios actuales.

AB  - Many believe that the future of innovation lies in simulation. However, as computers are becoming ever more powerful, so does the hyperbole used to discuss their potential in modelling across a vast range of domains, from subatomic physics to chemistry, climate science, epidemiology, economics and cosmology. As we are about to enter the era of quantum and exascale computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence have entered the field in a significant way. In this article we give a brief history of simulation, discuss how machine learning can be more powerful if underpinned by deeper mechanistic understanding, outline the potential of exascale and quantum computing, highlight the limits of digital computing – classical and quantum – and distinguish rhetoric from reality in assessing the future of modelling and simulation, when we believe analogue computing will play an increasingly important role.

AB  - Digital transformation and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) are critical factors in modern enterprises. However, it is complex to achieve in developing countries because of a lack of guidance and budget to adopt technology and innovation culture, especially in Small and Medium Enterprises, so that companies can be supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI). To comprehend the situation in the Colombian market, this study collects data sources from scientific databases and relates them to studies in Industrial AI, I4.0, and the upcoming Industry 5.0. For the evaluation, two questionnaire-based studies are analyzed with data on various aspects of I4.0. Thus, the analysis shows degrees of I4.0 adoption, focusing on prevalent technologies and their alignment with sustainability. The main findings present capabilities and maturity in Colombia’s technological development areas and the potential of using AI objectively to support its transition.

AB  - The degree to which nations have come together to consider a potential global problem and possible solutions is remarkable. Most nations have participated in the United Nations sponsored study of the climate change problem. A report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change constitutes a major summary of thinking on climate change science. Still, climate science is in a state of early development. Many scientists are so far unconvinced that global warming from human produced greenhouse gases is significant or harmful. Similarly the scientific and engineering basis to manage now increasing greenhouse gases is immature. Reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gases, should we become committed that we can and must consider undertaking that task, will require much broader consideration of the role of humans in earth's carbon cycle. Many of the policies and practices which are being put into place in the name of the Kyoto Protocol seem short sighted in that context. This paper undertakes a review of some Kyoto derived policy initiatives which seem inappropriate, or possibly even counter to science based policies which might be considered in the context of long term greenhouse gas management for the coming decades and centuries. Indeed some may derive from issues and goals which have very little to do with the climate change issue. The purpose of this paper is to encourage consideration of the development of policy which unequivocally focuses on greenhouse gas management in the short and long term and thus integrates with the goals of sustainable development.

However, a large number of network attacks will threaten the data security, which will seriously affect network reliability and will greatly reduce the use value of wireless sensor networks. For network security issues, security model for Low-energy Consumption Tree Routing (LCTR) protocols has been proposed in this paper to provide reliable guarantee to achieve authentication and data integration using Message Authentication Code (MAC) or Digital Signature (DS) techniques. Research will devote to assess the implementation results and energy consumption of the common message authentication code and digital signature technology in tree routing protocol, so as to provide new option to security improvement for the wireless communication network.

AB  - The United Nations adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by keeping the 2030 agenda for Sustainable development to transform our world that including alleviating poverty, economy, society, energy conservation, sustainable production and consumption (food waste mitigation – SDG 12.3), and the environment (climate action –SDG 13) and many more with a mission to achieve a more sustainable future for the world by 2030. Food waste (SDG12.3) is becoming an economic burden on any country and directly or indirectly creates a barrier to achieving SDG 13. In the present study, with VOSviewer software's help, the growing issue of food waste and sustainability has been studied through the Scopus database (used for data collection). This study helps find the publication trend, analysis of author keywords, countries actively participated, and identify of most-cited publications and journal that published those articles on food waste and sustainability. A study of data collected from the Scopus database explored that before the SDG 2030 agenda, there were only 135 publications in this area. Still, there has been a rapid increase in publications after its formulation. "Food waste," "Anaerobic Digestion," "Environment," "LCA," and "Sustainability" was found as the maximum used author keywords. Countries like The United States, China, the United Kingdom, Italy, and India are top contributors to a march to achieve the SDGs 12.3 and 13. Scientific journals contribute more in this regard than social science journals. The study's limitations are that most of the publications are science-oriented and widely used the technical words used in chemistry and biology; therefore, it becomes a tedious task for a social science researcher to interpret the outcome in terms of social science.

AB  - In this study, we examined the literature on how urban agriculture under a circular economy (CE) model contributes to the development of sustainable cities. Through bibliometric and factorial analyses of the conceptual structure of the publications indexed in Scopus, we provided a brief overview of the scientific trends, impacts, and barriers. The results indicated that research on the intersection between the three themes is still in its early stages. The CE promotes networks of urban resources for their recovery and reuse for nutritional, water, and energy purposes in urban agriculture. Urban agriculture has been proposed as a nature-based solution where CE can play a vital role in enhancing the ecosystem services it provides. Although CE has not been investigated as a transversal system in the productive cycle of urban agriculture, we identified assessments of the reuse of agricultural resources. Composting, hydroponics, and vertical agriculture are the urban agriculture techniques that have been most closely associated with CE through strategies such as the use of recycled fertilizers, the incorporation of renewable sources, and the establishment of industrial symbiosis processes. Moreover, urban metabolism and life cycle assessment are crucial tools for material and energy flows. In conclusion, the synergy between CE and urban agriculture can trigger regeneration processes that transform cities in a sustainable way. Efforts toward holistic and measurable approaches to the multiple sustainable benefits generated by this synergy for cities are needed.

AB  - Electricity is indeed a fundamental element of contemporary society, and the transition towards ensuring clean and affordable electrical energy is one of the present challenges. This transition has proved to progress slowly, primarily due to the challenges associated with integrating renewable distributed energy resources (DERs). For instance, weather changes can dramatically impact the amount of peak power supplied on any given day. Microgrids are a promising concept that can help address these challenges, and many studies can be found in the literature that focus on implementing these complex systems. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding the specific subject of using the infrastructure of universities as a proof-of-concept. This paper aims to help fill this gap by reporting the case study of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in Brazil. The paper summarizes the current research in the local microgrid of UNICAMP, and shows its potential to boost sustainable development by decarbonizing universities, as a practical contribution beyond their educational value. The main components of the system are described, and the presented numerical results show how at least 33% of the campus’s monthly electricity consumption can be reduced. This proves that real-world microgrids can have a positive impact, not only on greenhouse gas emissions reduction but also on the overall system efficiency.

AB  - For librarians, organizing books can be a very tedious task. Within this framework, self-service book lending processes could be automated with the help of blockchain technology. The purpose of this study is to review and evaluate earlier studies on the application of blockchain technology in libraries. The study thoroughly analyzes secondary data gathered from Scopus, an extensive academic database, using the bibliometric method. About 87 papers were identified using specific keywords like "library," "service," and "blockchain." The research findings demonstrate that in addition to the prevalent usage of terms such as "blockchain" and "library," other terms commonly found in the literature are "conference," "smart," "technology," "data," and "engineering." This pattern indicates that creating brilliant libraries, or libraries that use cutting-edge technologies to provide better services and operations, is being viewed as starting with blockchain. Additionally, the sampled academic works’ titles frequently contain the word "conference," suggesting a strong interest in discussing blockchain at professional and educational gatherings. The study’s findings highlight how blockchain technology is increasingly being integrated with library services and could lead to more inventive, safe, and effective systems for library data management and operations.

AB  - Despite the wealth of studies on SDGs interlinkages, the energy sector, as one of the agenda, is solely illustrated in distinct indicators and targets under SDG 7. On the other hand, energy is one of the most vulnerable sectors impacted by the COVID-19 that could trigger sustainability crisis by possible failure to follow the net zero scenarios. The analysis on the relationship between SDGs and clean energy during the pandemic is considered necessary as it has challenged the revisions of nationally climate-change based initiatives and policy agenda at the country level. This study conducts a systematic review to elaborate the synergies between SDGs and existing energy related policy options and fills the knowledge gap on how those interactions during the COVID-19 bring a major influence to sustainability policy-making at the global level. The result is expected to appear as measurable energy-related policy options to deal with global health-system crisis in the future.

AB  - The rapid growth of urban population has significantly complicated urban planning and management. This paper examines the connected street lighting network as an innovative infrastructure solution for smart cities by integrating cutting-edge technologies into widespread street lighting network systems. Through a comprehensive literature review and expert consultancy, the study categorizes the predominant components of smart street lighting (SSL) and evaluates their potential contribution to sustainability and urban digital transformation. Among global researchers, China, Spain, and India stand out as the leading countries in this field. Furthermore, it is enhanced that the proposed connected lighting network not only increases the energy efficiency of cities and reduces their carbon footprint, but also contributes significantly to the improvement of human and ecological quality of life and the effective monitoring of various urban planning services. The study inferred that a connected street lighting system affects all six key smart city dimensions with the most substantial contribution (30%) to the smart living dimension. Additionally, the system aligns with nine of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), most prominently supporting SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).

AB  - Understanding electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior and energy consumption patterns is fundamental to support the transportation electrification trend. We analyzed a dataset of 2,385,173 charging sessions from 2,719 chargers across 158 stations in Beijing, China. First, the charging sessions of alternating-current slow chargers (ACSCs) are mainly affected by parking behavior related to adjacent buildings; conversely, the charging sessions of direct-current fast chargers (DCFCs) cater to urgent charging demands. Second, adjacent building type and public accessibility significantly impact a station’s charging power profile. Public station profiles can be quantified by combining private and independent station profiles. Third, the impact of charger rated power on utilization rate varies by station type. The charger utilization rate increases with its rated power at independent and commercial stations, but decreases at workplace and residential stations. This study reveals the inherent behavioral and energy-use relationship between EVs and buildings, providing guidance for charging infrastructure planning.

AB  - The transition to sustainable energy systems is being driven across building, transportation, and power grid sectors to achieve sustainable development goals. Collaborative, multi-sector energy systems at the city level promote energy sharing and interactions, leading to enhanced urban renewable energy share and reduced carbon emissions compared to single-sector measures. While most research has concentrated on single-sector measures, limited attention has been given to cross-sector energy interactions in the context of urban electrification and hydrogenation. This review presents a multidisciplinary analysis of the interplay between energy dynamics and carbon reduction potential across sectors, highlighting: 1) building consumers and prosumers; 2) building energy management and scale updates; 3) charging infrastructure location methods; 4) climate models and energy resilience enhancement strategies; and 5) applications of artificial intelligence. This review also emphasizes the role of charging stations and hydrogen refuelling stations as critical nodes in urban cross-sector energy network. Several future research directions are identified, including: 1) the development of resilient indicators for city-scale, cross-sector energy systems; 2) the planning of charging station that consider cross-sector energy system updates and climate change impacts; 3) strategies for energy sharing and interactions within urban cross-sector energy system; 4) profit mechanisms to incentivize energy investors and consumers. This review offers urban planners and researchers with insightful recommendations for the design, planning and management of future urban energy infrastructure, emphasizing the importance of integrated, multi-sector approaches for achieving sustainability and resilience.

AB  - The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is fraught with complex and difficult problems. Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a powerful tool to assist in addressing these problems. Therefore, over the years, researchers have been conducting research on AI in the AEC industry (AI-in-the-AECI). In this paper, the first comprehensive scientometric study appraising the state-of-the-art of research on AI-in-the-AECI is presented. The science mapping method was used to systematically and quantitatively analyze 41,827 related bibliographic records retrieved from Scopus. The results indicated that genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets, and machine learning have been the most widely used AI methods in AEC. Optimization, simulation, uncertainty, project management, and bridges have been the most commonly addressed topics/issues using AI methods/concepts. The primary value and uniqueness of this study lies in it being the first in providing an up-to-date inclusive, big picture of the literature on AI-in-the-AECI. This study adds value to the AEC literature through visualizing and understanding trends and patterns, identifying main research interests, journals, institutions, and countries, and how these are linked within now-available studies on AI-in-the-AECI. The findings bring to light the deficiencies in the current research and provide paths for future research, where they indicated that future research opportunities lie in applying robotic automation and convolutional neural networks to AEC problems. For the world of practice, the study offers a readily-available point of reference for practitioners, policy makers, and research and development (R&D) bodies. This study therefore raises the level of awareness of AI and facilitates building the intellectual wealth of the AI area in the AEC industry.

AB  - Climate change is undoubtedly a global threat, with extreme weather events, air pollution, and food insecurity disproportionately impacting low-income countries. The healthcare sector, whilst responsible for 4.4% of global net carbon emissions, has been slow in addressing its environmental footprint. This article explores the needs and challenges to achieve sustainable orthopaedic surgery. Orthopaedic surgery continues to create a large carbon footprint, primarily through the use of single-use consumables and energy-intensive operating theatres. While efforts to reduce environmental harm have primarily targeted changes within the operating theatre, a comprehensive approach must consider the entire surgical pathway. The principles of reduce, reuse and recycle are paramount. Reducing surgical caseload and advancing digital healthcare afford opportunities to streamline patient interactions, reduce travel emissions and improve efficiency. Furthermore, reevaluating routine practices, such as preoperative investigations and postoperative care, can minimize unnecessary resource consumption. Improving the sustainability of orthopaedics will bring conflicting clinical, financial and environmental challenges. However, with increasing awareness among healthcare professionals and support from it's professional bodies, there is growing momentum toward sustainable orthopaedic surgery. Transitioning to sustainable orthopaedic surgery neccesitates a broad approach encompassing prevention, optimization, and streamlining of the surgical pathway. Addressing environmental concerns alongside clinical outcomes is imperative for the future of orthopaedic surgery.

AB  - 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) is presented as an important process in the future of civil engineering, as it accelerates the construction process, reduces labor costs, and potentially generates significantly less waste materials. Currently, 3DCP has been delayed as a technical solution for Latin American. However, it could be an important option for tackling the housing deficit in developing countries as well. The deployment of 3DCP depends on many different local factors, either political, economic, or technological. This paper discusses the potential, challenges, and research needs to deploy 3DCP in Brazil. It starts presenting the Brazilian economic context in the struggle to reduce the housing deficit over the years. Then, the challenges related to the implementation of 3DCP are compared with the opportunities, such as the abundance of low-carbon materials (earth-based, biomass, etc.), which could turn 3DCP into a sustainable business. Although this review is focused on Brazil, the authors believe that the context also applies to many other developing countries with similar social inequality conditions.

AB  - The ever-increasing demand for fossil fuels and environmental issues have been the major concerns over the past few decades to search for viable alternative fuels where hydrogen find its suitability to be a viable and promising alternative fuel option on existing IC engine platforms in bridging the contemporary gap to the long term fuel cell based power train roadmap. It's clean burning capability helps to meet the stringent emission norms. Complete substitution of diesel with hydrogen may not be expedient for the time being but the potential use of hydrogen in a diesel engine in dual fuel mode is possible. The study also investigates the use of Artificial Neural Network modeling for prediction of performance and emission characteristics such as BSEC, BTE, NOx, Soot (FSN), UHC, CO2 of the existing single cylinder four-stroke diesel engine with hydrogen in dual fuel mode. Levenberg–Marquardt back propagation training algorithm with logarithmic sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function have resulted in the best model for prediction of performance and emissions characteristics which has been well supported by the trade-off analysis between NOx–Soot (FSN)–BSEC. Fuzzy based analysis has been incorporated into existing ANN model for optimal parameter design which suggests the modesty of the employed transfer function of the existing ANN model.

However, the number of devices usage directly increase the Waste of Electronic and Electrical Equipment (WEEE), causing various environmental and human health problems. Previous studies showed that Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) is one of the solutions to solve the WEEE problem. Nonetheless, this CLSC concept is quite challenging to understand because of its complex material structure, terminology, mechanism, various collection, and treatment strategies. This research has a specific purpose of helping higher education students understand the CLSC concept more effective by using a Serious Simulation Game (SSG). As a result of this research, the author proposes an attainable conceptual design of SSG to help students extend their learning experience to understand the CLSC concept for solving the WEEE problem.

AB  - Tangerang local government's housing policy states that settlement area has to be rejuvenated through the ‘green housing’ development. This study suggest that urban planning policy has to consider about carbon footprint as one of sustainability indicator. Many studies reviewed from socio-economic issues to figure whether the policy is sustainable whilst there is lack of consideration about carbon footprint per-capita emitted. Employing carbon metric, GIS and system dynamic methods, carbon footprint per-capita was estimated based on the implementation of green housing development. This study was focus on whole life cycle of building: construction phase, operational phase and demolition phase. Demolition would be conducted to settlement area which is not suitable with RTRW (urban land use planning). The result show that in the early year of policy implementation, there would be an increasing number of carbon footprint per capita due to the demolition and construction phases. However, in the long term carbon footprint per capita would be less cause by implementation of green housing.

AB  - Given the globally abundant availability of waste plastics and the negative environmental impacts of textile dyeing sludge (TDS), their co-combustion can effectively enhance the circular economies, energy recovery, and environmental pollution control. The (co-)combustion performances, gas emissions, and ashes of TDS and two plastics of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were quantified and characterized. The increased blend ratio of PP and PE improved the ignition, burnout, and comprehensive combustion indices. The two plastics interacted with TDS significantly in the range of 200–600 ℃. TDS pre-ignited the combustion of the plastics which in turn promoted the combustion of TDS. The co-combustions released more CO2 but less CH4, C-H, and CO as CO2 was less persistent than the others in the atmosphere. The Ca-based minerals in the plastics enhanced S-fixation and reduced SO2 emission. The activation energy of the co-combustion fell from 126.78 to 111.85 kJ/mol and 133.71–79.91 kJ/mol when the PE and PP additions rose from 10% to 50%, respectively. The co-combustion reaction mechanism was best described by the model of f(α) = (1-α)n. The reaction order was reduced with the additions of the plastics. The co-combustion operation interactions were optimized via an artificial neural network so as to jointly meet the multiple objectives of maximum energy production and minimum emissions.

AB  - The load capacity factor is crucial for France's economic development regarding green energy, supply chain, and digital innovation by enabling the effective utilization of resources, minimizing adverse effects on the environment, and enhancing economic growth. This study has introduced a novel model to examine the impact of supply chain disruptions, renewable energy consumption, eco-innovation, energy tax, human capital, and economic growth on the load capacity factor (LF) of France's economy throughout 1994–2021 by employing the Quantile-on-Quantile Kernel-Based Regularized Least Squares (QQKRLS) and Quantile Causality Analysis. The QQKRLS findings depict that supply chain disruptions and human capital are strongly positively correlated with the LF for moderate to high quantiles, highlighting the importance of operations and human capital. The change in renewable energy consumption reveals an unsystematic pattern and turns negative at higher quantiles, implying sustainability problems. Eco-innovation is positive at lower quantile levels of the LF, and energy tax influence is inversely related to similar levels of LF. An increase in economic growth is associated with the load capacity factor at some selected quantiles, thereby asserting the advantages of some operations capacity. Quantile causality test findings show the top causality at the mid-quantile, implying that LF affects its mid-level most with a decreasing impact on the higher level. It must also be realized that these factors have varying effects depending on which operational situation is being considered. The study findings presented here support a unique strategy for policy and management.

AB  - Radiology is a major contributor to health care's impact on climate change, in part due to its reliance on energy-intensive equipment as well as its growing technological reliance. Delivering modern patient care requires a robust informatics team to move images from the imaging equipment to the workstations and the health care system. Radiology informatics is the field that manages medical imaging IT. This involves the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of imaging information in health care to improve access and quality, which includes PACS, cloud services, and artificial intelligence. However, the electricity consumption of computing and the life cycle of various computer components expands the carbon footprint of health care. The authors provide a general framework to understand the environmental impact of clinical radiology informatics, which includes using the international Greenhouse Gas Protocol to draft a definition of scopes of emissions pertinent to radiology informatics, as well as exploring existing tools to measure and account for these emissions. A novel standard ecolabel for radiology informatics tools, such as the Energy Star label for consumer devices or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification for buildings, should be developed to promote awareness and guide radiologists and radiology informatics leaders in making environmentally conscious decisions for their clinical practice. At this critical climate juncture, the radiology community has a unique and pressing obligation to consider our shared environmental responsibility in innovating clinical technology for patient care.

AB  - With the rapid development of renewable energy penetration and the transition to high-efficiency, low-carbon-footprint energy systems, renewable-based heat-electricity integrated energy systems (RHE-IES) have become a viable method. The dispatch and operation scheduling of the RHE-IES is more complex than before because a well-operated RHE-IES should be economically favorable, environmentally friendly, and feasible with respect to security constraints. However, it is not easy to balance these trade-offs with uncertainties. In this work, a multi-objective hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (H-DRL) method is proposed to address the dispatch of RHE-IES, and it is also explainable due to the design of the algorithmic structure, the decoupling of rewards, and the analysis of feature importance. First, the dispatch and operation scheduling problem of the RHE-IES is formulated considering economic, environmental, and security constraints and is converted to a Markov decision process. Second, a novel H-DRL method is proposed with a multi-critic, single-actor structure, where each objective is handled by a designated deep critic network with decoupled rewards, and the action value functions of different objectives are hierarchically optimized by the actor network. H-DRL can be trained in a comprehensive environment offline and provide fast online decisions considering the uncertainties of renewable generation. Third, a shapley additive explanations method is carried out utilizing the explainable nature of the H-DRL structure and the loss function design. The simulation results and case studies show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of balancing the tradeoffs of different objectives, overcoming uncertainties and enhancing AI interpretability.

AB  - This chapter shows how the exponential data creation of the Internet will have a drastic impact on the requirements of communication for data centers. As more than 70% of the data traffic will be inside the data centers, very high bandwidth and low latency communication means are required. But power is also a limiting factor, due to its impact on the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). These constraints cannot be solved by copper interconnect; therefore, new optical interconnect solutions, such as silicon photonics and the use of optical interposers are emerging. As photonics will come closer to the chips (from board limit to intra-board links, and even inside package of chips as interposers), new technologies have to be developed, and, e.g., advanced packaging architectures such as interposers will allow reaching Tbps with power consumption reduction by 2020.

AB  - There is no doubt that managing the flow of goods depends on monitoring the real flow in the physical world meanwhile in the digital world. Today automatic identification (auto-ID) technologies are used to close the gap between these two different environments by online updating of databases as the materials flow in the chain. From this point of view, it can be said that auto-ID technologies are core components of automated inventory control systems on all echelons of supply chain. As being a novel subcomponent of auto-ID, RFID innovates important features. Due to the fact that RFID is a recently developed technology, there exist some deficiencies, like the lack of standardization and the lack of legislation regulations that cause questions about privacy and security in society. In this study, we reviewed the standardization studies of related organizations like EPC global and ISO and compare these regulations. We also classify the risks that threaten the privacy of individuals and organizations. Finally, regarding the standardization studies and existing risks towards the privacy of individuals and organizations, security proposals and policy suggestions are introduced.

AB  - One of the reasons Africa has struggled to attain its full economic potentials is because of lack of energy. Optimization of available energy is a very important tool for sustainable development in Africa. Nigeria is currently the largest economy in Africa and one of the largest producers of crude oil in the continent yet it has visibly struggled with energy shortages. An improvement in the energy efficiency of appliances in buildings will significantly reduce energy wastage and improve the distribution and use of energy in the country. This paper aims to design a framework to improve energy efficiency in appliances in a selected residential building in Nigeria. It was revealed that energy efficiency in appliances leads to improved energy savings, liberating huge capital for investments in the country. The calculated retrofitted model for energy efficiency resulted into a 56.8 percent reduction on the cost incurred on energy used yearly. Lastly, a model for calculating the appropriateness of appliances to be installed in households was given in this paper.

The paper also continues to track the possible available and untapped renewable energy resources and outlines the credible Path-ways for Rwanda's energy future in the next 30 years and beyond, by considering how much energy we might need and where it could come from and hence, how possibly the different electrical energy generation technologies could be shared in an effective way to meet the demand. To identify how the country needs to integrate the most renewable energy generation in its energy system, the results show that in 2050 fuel is free to be totally decommissioned which results in a remarkable drop in CO2 emission.

AB  - Tec21 is an educational model launched in August 2019 by Tecnologico de Monterrey, in Mexico. As part of students' Exploration stage elective course choices, the School of Engineering and Sciences offered, during the Fall 2020 term, a 5-week course on the topic of Causes, Consequences and Solutions to Climate Change (DS1002B), aimed at students 1) with no previous background or stated interest on the subject and 2) registered in a different school. The objective of this work was to assess the understanding and attitude of non-engineering, second-year undergraduate students toward the climate change crisis after taking the course DS1002B, in which students learn about the basic science of climate change science and acquire the following skills: 1) calculation of greenhouse gases emission inventories, 2) decision making of climate change mitigation and/or adaptation actions, and 3) reflect about the importance of creating awareness about climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the course was implemented online with the participation of270 students divided in 4 groups: 2 Regular-small-local (RSL) groups and 2 Elite- massive-national (EMN) groups, which differed in the number of attending professors, number of students, students' location, and language of instruction. The learning process was assessed in terms of attitude, confidence and source credibility. One of the main findings was that the number of students and language had no impact on learning motivation and attitude towards climate change. Also, a better understanding of the target audience will allow for increased engagement, perception and motivation, leading to more well-rounded future decision makers.

AB  - Multiple activities in the photovoltaic (PV) sector demonstrate a will to improve environmental impacts, reduce critical material uses and waste generated by linear supply chains. A common understanding of the remaining priority gaps in sustainability is, however, lacking, hindering the implementation of strategic courses of action. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12), targeting sustainable consumption and production, constitutes an entry point for PV stakeholders to examine their impacts holistically by reconciling ecological sustainability, criticality, and circularity. This article introduces a framework to map sustainability strategies in PV under the lens of SDG 12. A gap analysis is conducted to identify the current sustainability performances of PV value chains. The readiness level of the sector to close each gap is then evaluated, thus highlighting the “low hanging fruits” and the more consequent efforts required to achieve sustainability. Overall, a lack of common key performance indicators is noticed, resulting in a fragmented and uncertain sustainability landscape. A need for more coherence, sustainability leadership, and collaboration at the sectoral level is identified for all topics of SDG 12. In particular, the implementation of circularity strategies is linked to substantial technoeconomic hurdles, which need to be addressed.

AB  - It is not in doubt that there is a nexus between climate-smart agriculture and the actualization of sustainable development goal 2 (SDG 2). With climate change impact in Nigeria becoming more adverse and its threats to the agricultural sector surging, the need to adopt resilient mitigation and adaptation strategies has become more expedient. Thus, this study interrogates the implications of climate-smart agriculture as a response mechanism to climatic dysfunctionalities and a leeway to the full-blown achievement of SDG 2 in Nigeria. The work relies substantially on secondary information from books, journal articles and policy briefs. The study asserts that climate-smart agriculture represents one of the innovative approaches to achieving SDG 2 and, by extension, food security in Nigeria. During the inquiry, several challenges to implementing CSA were identified and highlighted. It posits that CSA application has heightened among Nigerian farmers, but its holistic performance should be fast-tracked if SDG2 will be achieved. The government and pertinent stakeholders must provide more comprehensive and better-coordinated support for farmers, such as requisite funding, to enable them to mitigate climate change impacts adequately.

AB  - The achievement of sustainable development goals requires implementing a design approach to the industrial product development aimed to reduce waste, and to increase value, in accordance to principles of the “circular economy.” To mitigate the product obsolescence rate, the design activity aims at making the product multifunctional, its life longer and its maintainability more effective. Moreover, the product must be easily reparable, adaptable to operating conditions, friendly updatable, and reusable after decommissioning. Those targets affect the design methodology, and require some suitable tools. This article investigates how the “model-based systems engineering” is applied to the “circular design,” to provide a sustainable product life, and to regenerate the system, while decommissioning. Particularly, the direct experience of machine designer of industrial product, being the result of material processing and manufacturing, is considered. Are matter of discussion the identification of some issues related to sustainability and decommissioning, the methodologic tools useful to integrate the two approaches, the impact on the metamodeling activity, and the interoperable tool chain exploited. An industrial test case, as the automated guided vehicle, is preliminarily discussed to describe the implementation of the above-mentioned concepts and to identify any potential critical issues.

AB  - Universities the world over, are synonymous with teaching, research and community service. This tripartite assignment can prove very beneficial in combating climatic dysfunctionalities. To elucidate, while faculty members can teach students climate conservative practices and sensitize their communities, research clusters domiciled in such institutions can seek to discover more cost effective and efficient mitigative/adaptative activities to combat the raging and raving menace of climate change. Taking into cognizance the severity of climate change and its propensity to lead to whole exterminations of societies and destruction of livelihoods, climate-interventionist activities have become not just imminent but inevitable. Hence, in tandem with this position, the paper examines the role of Nigerian universities in combating climate change in their institutions and host communities. In a bid to actualize this objective, we have critically examined the activities of selected schools who have come up with one initiative or the other as a stop-gap measure for tackling the rampaging menace of climate change. The core objective of this paper therefore is to examine the performance level of these programmes while identifying areas for improvement. The paper is qualitatively driven and draws from secondary sources of data such as book chapters, journal articles, policy briefs, conference articles among others. We observed that paucity of sufficient budgetary allocations to help these institutions achieve their objective is a major challenge to their climate change reduction agenda. Hence, we recommend that special funding be granted to such universities irrespective of their ownership structure.The paper addresses the issue of applied sciences by engendering a paradigm shift from the laboratory to the field through promoting inclusive participation of universities in combating climate change.

AB  - It is becoming more widely acknowledged that hydrogen is a promising energy source that can help us move towards a low-carbon, sustainable future. With its wealth of biomass resources, Africa offers a special chance to realise this hydrogen production potential. Using the Aspen Plus process simulation tool, this study explores the viability and sustainability of using biomass feedstock for hydrogen production. The abundance of biomass resources in Africa presents a significant opportunity to both meet energy needs and cut greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. Meeting the growing need for hydrogen as a clean energy source and actively assisting in the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable future are the main goals of this research. When combined with the water gas shift reaction, biomass gasification is the process used to extract hydrogen gas from biomass. Incorporating the water gas shift reaction (WGSR) maximises the output of hydrogen. A scaling factor might be used to achieve the desired product output, although the initial biomass input flow rate was set at 1000 tonnes year. Prior to the scaling factor being applied, the reaction produced an annual mass flow rate of 94.888 tonnes. With a specified ratio of 3:1 between steam and biomass, the gasifier only used 9.9% of the steam. The production process was greatly improved by the water-gas shift reactor, which increased the annual production of hydrogen from 94.888 tonnes to 115.53 tonnes. In line with international efforts to shift to greener energy sources and fight climate change, this research significantly advances the generation of green hydrogen in Africa.

The research design of the study is qualitative. Empirical data is obtained through a combination of exploratory and descriptive research strategies. Energy efficiency-oriented entrepreneurship is defined as a proactive attitude or readiness to seek, create, and discover opportunities to improve energy efficiency in existing business organizations, while entrepreneurship-oriented energy efficiency is related to the provision of opportunities for enterprises to use less energy when performing the same tasks or achieving the same results. According to the future experts, involved in the survey, entrepreneurship-oriented energy efficiency initiatives are more needed as a starting point for the development of a sustainable economy, but energy efficiency-oriented entrepreneurship is more important.

AB  - The construction industry is currently experiencing robust global growth. With the advancement of technology, real estate development is evolving through the adoption of new strategies. The present study aims to identify the optimal formulation for unfired bricks made from clay and Doum fibers sourced from the Taounate region in Morocco. To achieve this, six brick samples were produced with varying amounts of Doum fibers (0 %, 1 %, 5 %, 7 %, 10 %, and 12 %), and their performance was assessed through tests for bulk density, linear shrinkage, compressive strength, and thermal conductivity. The results indicate that the resulting bricks are lightweight, with a bulk density not exceeding 1.75 g/cm3, in accordance with the NM EN 772-16 standard. Furthermore, there was a notable reduction in linear shrinkage, reaching up to 80 %. The reference brick without fiber additions exhibited a shrinkage of 5.86 %, whereas the brick containing a high fiber content of 12 % demonstrated a linear shrinkage of 1.12 %. The strength of the brick decreases with increasing fiber content, but the thermal insulation properties improve significantly. Considering these variations, the optimal enhancement in thermal and mechanical performance was determined to be 41.5 % in terms of compressive strength and thermal conductivity, corresponding to a 10 % inclusion of Doum fibers. The optimal brick is classified as EB6 according to the German standard DIN 18945 (2013–08), with a thermal conductivity of 0.31 W/m.K and a compressive strength of 8.26 MPa, rendering it suitable for use in earth construction. This study also concludes that the production cost for the optimal brick is half that of the conventional bricks available in the building materials market. This holds promising implications for the future of harnessing local natural resources in the field of eco-construction, as it positively impacts the economy and environment of the region.

AB  - Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is emerging as a promising solution to mitigate global CO2 emissions from the industrial and energy sectors. This review delves into the prospects of CCUS technologies for application in buildings, highlighting their benefits and challenges, and examining their economic and environmental impacts. A case study is also provided to shed light on the impact of integrating direct air capture (DAC) into buildings on their energy bills and indoor air quality. The study emphasizes that DAC is a promising carbon capture technology in buildings, with a levelized cost of CO2 capture using DAC in the range of 56–2499 and 262–535 $/tCO2 for solid- and liquid-based DAC, respectively. As for the utilization of CO2 captured within buildings, microalgae cultivation and construction materials manufacturing are the most researched pathways. In contrast, transporting captured CO2 is currently focused on the industrial sector, dictating the need for implementing cost-effective approaches for connecting urban areas to the planned industrial CO2 transport infrastructure when CO2 geological storage is targeted. Although the CO2 transport and storage approaches remain technically feasible, solutions based on local handling of CO2, such as microalgae cultivation, plants, or its use as a feedstock for the production of locally oriented products, offer more realistic strategies that demand further exploration. Finally, the social acceptance aspects, the effect of policy measures, and the role of artificial intelligence in enhancing the widespread adaptation of these strategies from conventional industrial decarbonization purposes to building contexts are explored and discussed.

AB  - Achieving carbon neutrality is seen as an important goal in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, as carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. Many countries, cities and organizations have set targets to become carbon neutral. The pharmaceutical sector is no exception, being a major contributor of carbon emissions (emitting approximately 55% more than the automotive sector for instance) and hence is in need of strategies to reduce its environmental impact. Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an advanced pharmaceutical fabrication technology that has the potential to replace traditional manufacturing tools. Being a new technology, the environmental impact of 3D printed medicines has not been investigated, which is a barrier to its uptake by the pharmaceutical industry. Here, the energy consumption (and carbon emission) of 3D printers is considered, focusing on technologies that have successfully been demonstrated to produce solid dosage forms. The energy consumption of 6 benchtop 3D printers was measured during standby mode and printing. On standby, energy consumption ranged from 0.03 to 0.17 kWh. The energy required for producing 10 printlets ranged from 0.06 to 3.08 kWh, with printers using high temperatures consuming more energy. Carbon emissions ranged between 11.60 and 112.16 g CO2 (eq) per 10 printlets, comparable with traditional tableting. Further analyses revealed that decreasing printing temperature was found to reduce the energy demand considerably, suggesting that developing formulations that are printable at lower temperatures can reduce CO2 emissions. The study delivers key initial insights into the environmental impact of a potentially transformative manufacturing technology and provides encouraging results in demonstrating that 3D printing can deliver quality medicines without being environmentally detrimental.

AB  - Nuclear and renewable (low-carbon) energy research and development is crucial for a sustainable future, transitioning away from fossil fuels. However, adequate financial sources are imperative to stimulate this transition. Financial institutions, particularly banking institutions, play a critical role in fulfilling the financial needs for green energy transition. This study investigates the effects of banking sector development, low-carbon energy investments, economic growth, and trade openness on environmental sustainability. Notably, novel Fourier asymmetric ARDL and artificial intelligence-based neural network methods are used for empirical analysis. The Fourier approach captures nonlinearities in the banking sector development and environment relationship. It is found that the negative shocks of banking sector development and economic growth reduce environmental sustainability. However, the positive effects of low-carbon energy investments and trade openness on environmental quality offer a promising path toward a more sustainable future. The Japanese government should accelerate low-carbon energy investments to accelerate the transition from fossil energy to green energy sources. This transition holds the potential to significantly improve Japan's environmental sustainability and contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7. In addition, since the decline of the banking sector's development in Japan undermines environmental sustainability, financial planning should be implemented to progress this sector.

But how do we do that, and, what are we aiming for?With this workshop, we propose that HCI should start working with the new global Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that were formally adopted by the UN in September 2015. How can Sustainable HCI be inspired by, and contribute to these goals? What should we in the field of HCI do more of, and what should we perhaps do less of? In what areas should we form partnerships in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goals and with whom should we partner?

With increase in the agricultural and industrial activities in Africa, modern forms of energy are required for optimal kickoff, efficiency and sustainability of these activities which are necessary requirements for the development of the African continent. Unfortunately, access to modern forms of energy has eluded Africans and only about 30% of the population has access to electricity while 90% relies on traditional fuels for cooking. This paper proposes a framework that will assist in the provision of modern energy to Africans. This framework takes into cognisance monitoring, energy efficiency, sustainability and management and also renewable energy among other things.

AB  - Smart grid, as the next power grid, can efficiently monitor, predicate, and control energy generation/consumption by using the real-time users' electricity information. However, the fine-grained user energy consumption information may reveal the private information of the user. In this paper, we construct a linkable anonymous credential protocol based on Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) signature. Then, we propose a privacy preserving smart metering scheme based on the new linkable anonymous credential. In addition to providing privacy protection for the user, our protocol also has the security properties of message authentication and traceability of fault smart metering. And there are some other useful features in our protocol, such as no need of trust-third party, dynamic users' enrollment and revocation, and complex statistical analysis of the energy use information. The computation cost and communication overhead of our scheme is O(1), which is independent of the user number. The simulation results show that our scheme is efficient.

In this paper, using the Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development framework, an assessment of GHG emissions trends along with national and international pledges for a set of developed (Portugal and United Kingdom) and developing countries (China and Brazil) is presented, contributing for an insightful comparison of countries that share a common cause, irrespective of their developmental stage. The preliminary results show that UK and China need to focus on the improvement of the renewable nature of their energy mix, whereas Portugal and Brazil need to focus more on measures that contribute to improve the efficient use of energy. Hence, environmental and energy intensity indicators together have allowed to emphasize aspects that would otherwise separately pass unnoticed.

At the same time, vendors must deal with stringent time-to-market challenges and tight budget constraints. This leads to the use and integration of intellectual property (IP) cores. Vulnerabilities in these cores may compromise the system’s security. This paper presents a novel architecture concept that allows for a secure integration of IP cores with only minimal security assumptions. This is achieved by a hardware component called trusted communication unit (TCU) that isolates all components on the chip. A post-routing implementation shows only small security costs in terms of TCU area overhead of around 13%.

AB  - The necessity of decarbonizing the power sector has become central to achieving sustainable development goals on a global scale. Despite its significance, the application of electricity sector modeling remains limited, especially in developing nations such as Bangladesh. This study aims to bridge this gap by utilizing open data and open-source code to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Bangladesh's power system transition up to 2050. Specifically, Python for Power System Analysis (PyPSA) is employed to develop a customized model named PyPSA-BD. Leveraging ERA5 reanalyses data, we construct cost-optimized models that consider various national policies, with particular emphasis on pivotal years such as 2030, 2041, and 2050. Through a comparative analysis with official reports from the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB), and Integrated Energy and Power Master Plan (IEPMP) 2023, this research sheds light on key insights crucial for policy formulation, effective management, and strategic investment planning within Bangladesh's power sector.

AB  - In recent years, one major problem confronting the human race that seems to have defied the myriad of solutions deployed to combat it is the raging and raving issue of climate change. As worrisome as the issue is, there have been arguments for intensification of climate change education as the panacea for this conundrum. While CCE has been restricted to schools and formal workplaces, we opine that this is limiting and could prove counterproductive as there is the need to avail workers in such settings the opportunity of gaining climate education. This represents the thrust of this paper as we intend to evaluate the prospects of this endeavor vis-a-vis its challenges with a view to appraise its implications for SDG 13. Taking into cognizance the huge population of the informal sector, excluding them from the benefits of CCE will be tantamount to a catastrophe as these army of employees if enlightened on proper climate conservative practices can help the nation win the war against climatic dysfunctionalities. Adopting a desktop research method and drawing data from secondary data sources such as journal papers, book chapters, policy briefs and monograph articles among other outlets, we observed that there is low deployment of CCE to the informal sector. Hence, our admonition to the government on the need to ensure the ministry of information through the national orientation agency and all relevant stakeholders draw up CCE education programs specifically for this segment while CCE literature be disseminated to workers in this category.

Although many studies had identified various advantages of adopting a circular economy, only a few studies have investigated the risks of adopting a circular economy context. Therefore, to fill this research gap, this study proposes a preliminary risks assessment of adopting circular economy initiatives in the Indonesian plastic supply chain. First, this study performed a literature review to identify risk criteria in the plastic manufacturing supply chain's circular economy initiative. Second, it continued by interviewing the experts to validate the identified risks. Right experts are involved in rating the criteria on a four-point Likert scale. From expert appraisal, this study established eight risk categories and 31 specific risks for further analysis.

AB  - Hybrid renewable energy sources with energy storage systems (ESS) are becoming more prevalent in offering remote consumers with efficient, affordable, and dependable energy alternatives to traditional systems. The ESS is essential for the integration of hybrid RES in order to balance the supply of power with demand. Simultaneously, the price fluctuations and intermittent nature of RES led to the invention of ESS for RES. To do this, the recently established deep learning (DL) models can be utilized to optimize the ESS for RES for maximum performance. With this purpose in mind, this study presents an optimal attention-based bidirectional long and short-term memory (OABLSTM-ESS) technique for energy storage systems utilizing renewable energy sources. By resolving the optimization problem, the described OABLSTM-ESS technique attempts to minimize electricity costs while achieving productivity requirements. In addition, an attention based BiLSTM (ABLSTM) method has been created to take advantage of the inherent benefits of anticipated future processes. Moreover, the improved coyote optimization algorithm (ICOA) is used to best select the ABLSTM model's hyperparameters. The ICOA is created by merging the COA with the hill climbing (HC) idea, which helps to search for and improve the learning strategy while determining the candidate solutions for the COA. A vast array of simulation analyses are implemented to assure the improved performance of the OABLSTM-ESS approach. According to the results, the minimal CT for the OABLSTM-ESS approach was 0.53 min for the forecast of electricity prices, 0.50 min for the forecast of wind energy, and 0.47 min for the forecast of solar energy. The OABLSTM-ESS method outperformed the other methods, as evidenced by the data and discussion in their totality. Based on a comparison of the results, it was found that the OABLSTM-ESS method is better than recent approaches in many ways.

AB  - Nowadays, increasing obligations on manufacturers to reduce ecological footprint have created a clear trend toward lifecycle assessment (LCA) for measuring CO2 emissions. In this context, assessing the emission values of products is crucial for manufacturers. However, the current enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems lack the necessary data and functionalities for LCA, particularly for calculating emissions from transport routes. Therefore, this paper addresses this issue by proposing an automated and ERP-based route calculation for carbon footprint capturing. Using a case study from the automotive supply sector, a novel Python-based approach is developed that integrates ERP systems with routing applications to automatically calculate and prepare transport data for LCA. This solution not only improves data accuracy and efficiency but also facilitates the industry’s move toward an automated carbon footprint assessment, relevant for both large and small enterprises. The results show that automated routing significantly improves data accuracy and efficiency in carbon footprint calculations.

AB  - In this article we lay the foundations for a new approach for Jevons Paradox and rebound effects, based on how it is triggered (origin) and how it expands (expansion), and from it, explore the potential of different ways to minimize or offset rebounds from resources productivity and conservation. We conceptualize different key aspects to understand and reframe rebound effects. On the “origin” side, we introduce the key concept of “resource-efficient paths”, to show how productivity is a changing and complex issue, affected by the interaction of all other resources that produce goods or services, as well as behavior. This is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the existence of rebound effects. On the “expansion” side we introduce the notion of systemic insatiability as key in the expansion and consolidation of rebounds through socioeconomic systems, and sufficient condition for the existence of rebound effects. Moreover, we analyze how inequality can exacerbate insatiability. With this framework in mind, we examine two main positions to find solutions: In the first, under our current socioeconomic, cultural, and institutional structures, we analyze different means of public policy intervention: resources pricing, cap-and-trade systems, regulation, and voluntary actions. The second position implies tackling systemic changes. Here we explore different post-growth systemic alternatives: steady-state, degrowth, agrowth, and post-development intellectual currents in relation to rebounds and Jevons Paradox.

Adoption of energy efficiency has vast potential to use the energy at optimized cost and to use national energy resources in sustainable manner. Energy saving certification (ESCert) is a market based incentive mechanism to promote energy efficiency in systematic manner among defined energy users. Trading of energy saving certificate (ESCert) provides an opportunity to implement energy saving measures in cost effective and optimized manner. Challenges of a particular industry to implement energy efficiency measures at optimum cost can be overcame by the introduction of trading of certificate. This paper provides an overview of the market design of ESCert market in India.

This essay shows multidisciplinary results obtained by using both the building information modelling (BIM) and innovative approaches for design a highly energy efficient Hotel building that can represent a valuable attraction for the touristic demand of the village. In wider perspective, it will be firstly introduces an ongoing strategy of regional energy efficiency and tourist development which is under discussion by a network of small Lucanian villages in South of Italy.Integrated project delivery (IPD) and design optimization are the most benefits coming by BIM-collaborative methods. Many practical implications are coming from the implementation of BIM, like the high energy performance goal of the building, the reduction of extra costs of design changes during the subsequent phases of construction process. Accurated digital 3D models improve collaboration between project parties, to ensure that the project is well-coordinated before the construction phase begins. This paper investigates also the contribution of dyanmic energy analyses to design the hotel and their influence on the final architectural solutions, and aimed to become a real development model for a network of small villages..

AB  - The Paris Agreement on climate change signed during the recent XXI United Nations Convention generates further incentives towards sustainable development. In particular, the Clean Energy strategy that many European countries have agreed to targets 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 32% improvement in the share of renewable energy, and an increase in energy efficiency by 32.5% by 2030. In this study the energy requirements for four regions in Piedmont were examined. Such communities have diverse geomorphologic locations, population density and energy needs. The energy analysis was combined with the development and assessment of sustainability criteria for encouraging a real integration of the energy efficiency to environmental quality parameters. Such assessment includes a variety of criteria and reward points in order to incentivize the achievement of sustainable energy solutions in each region. The suggested environmental protocol proposed in this study is based on calculable criteria and indicators and on threshold values that make it possible to quickly evaluate the potential of a territory in order to create a sustainable energy community. This methodology is flexible and transferable elsewhere since the criteria and the threshold values can be modified to reflect the specific territorial context of interest.

The paper aims to identify the key gaps in improving the electrical energy access in Burundi and proposes a solution to overcome these gaps. It is shown that the electrical power grid is old and concentrated in the north-western Burundi and in Bujumbura while other regions lack access to national grids. Next to that, the link between electricity access and sustainable development in Burundi is clarified. Further, some solutions are suggested to solve energy access problems such as the electricity transmission lines extension and renovation, diversification of energy sources.

ENEX creates synergy with GRI, NASDAQ, UNGC, CDP, CDSB, IIRC and SASB indicators. The energy efficiency index is expressed both numerically and energy consumption labelling scheme of energy efficiency classes from A++ to E in the reporting where A++ being the most energy efficient, E the least efficient. ENEX allows us to use it as an auxiliary metric for other ESG methods of GRI, NASDAQ, UNGC, etc., as well as to verify and use it in the methods of credit rating assessments of enterprises.

Although, it gets highly remarkable and has many advantages, V2G system’s security is extremely challenging. Any security flaw in V2G system can cause serious issues on the system. Security issues might open doors to severe damages on the system. One of the most danger damage on such systems is disclosed confidential information. This work therefore analyses what are confidential information features in a V2G system, it then analyses whether a V2G system is vulnerable to attacks or not if the system’s confidential information is revealed. To do that, this study used fuzzy-classification technique in which a fuzzy system is developed. It also applied SVM and NB classification techniques in order to compare applied classification techniques in terms of their performances. Comparison results showed that fuzzy-classification technique performed better than other two techniques.

This gives ENEX access to indicators of the level of excellence in the use of energy resources. The index is a target for determining the capacity of energy efficiency programs. Despite the similarity with the E (ESG) environment metrics of GRI, NASDAQ, UNGC and others, ENEX has significant differences in the evaluation parameters. ENEX is a comprehensive indicator that contains a set of indicators (metrics) that are responsible for a wide range of criteria that determine the effective consumption of energy resources and the level of efficiency of the energy consumer as a whole object. The ENEX assessment parameters allow us to consider the reasons that affect the efficiency of energy use in the complex, and to identify areas of energy risks. Monitoring of ENEX indicators and the metric shows the sustainability of development and energy efficiency over time.

AB  - With the rapid growth of 5G technology, the increase of base stations not noly brings high energy consumption, but also becomes new flexibility resources for power system. For high energy consumption and low utilization of energy storage of base stations, the strategy of energy storage regulation of macro base station and sleep to save energy of micro base station based on genetic algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the variational mode decomposition and long short-term memory are combined in the model in which the parameters are optimized by using the genetic algorithm. By applying the model, the traffic of micro base station can be predicted, and the low load is selected to sleep. Then, a multi-objective optimization model of macro base station energy storage regulation is established, and the optimal charging power and discharging power are solved by genetic algorithm. Finally, collaborative working mode is given combining the charging and discharging power of macro base station and the power reduced of sleep of micro base station. The simulation shows that the strategy can reduce the energy consumption of the base station, and it can simultaneously assist power system to cut peak and fill valley to gain income.

AB  - When planning, creating, and evolving systems throughout their lifecycle, it is essential to assess their impact on our world. Despite this pressing need, existing structured methods for systematically assessing social, economic, and environmental impacts are not related to targets of the United Nations' sustainable development goals. Moreover, existing Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) lack concepts and tooling for sustainability assessment. Our aim is to allow modeling systems, their sustainability properties, and sustainability questions in a structured manner for a wide domain. This paper proposes the engineering and design of a domain-specific language for sustainability assessment embedded into ADLs and showcases its use for evaluating a citizen energy community system as a case study. We discuss possibilities on how to use such models in their further processing and explore challenges in technical realization. This initial step towards standardizing the sustainability assessments of modeled systems throughout the development is both comprehensive and formal so that developers can make informed, sustainable decisions based on consequence assessments upfront.

AB  - Semiconductor industry is foundational to the digital age as it drives the production of essential electronic devices. However, it faces the challenge of substantial electricity consumption. This paper investigates the energy footprint of semiconductor manufacturing processes. Previous studies indicate that semiconductor fabrication units (fabs) have significant electricity consumption and often rely on nonrenewable energy sources. Many of the advanced processes in its manufacturing require higher energy inputs, where clean-room maintenance and material usage contribute significantly to consumption. Despite many efforts, electricity usage trends show an upward trajectory, indicating growing operations and technological advancements. This research analyzes the energy distribution within the fab as well as discusses the measures that can improve the consumption patterns. We discuss how the measures that can be taken for balancing growth with sustainability. Addressing the challenge requires investments in research for renewable energy adoption, and smart energy management systems. Innovations in equipment, cooling systems, and recycling practices are some of the avenues for reducing energy consumption. Therefore, urgent action is important to minimize this industry’s environmental impact while meeting the rising demand for semiconductor products. This demands innovation for achieving sustainability goals in the semiconductor industry.

AB  - This research article conducts a comprehensive literature review on the concept of urban metabolism (UM), with a special focus on the transition from a linear to a circular model. In the context of climate change, increasing urbanisation, and resource depletion, cities are recognised as playing a crucial role in environmental sustainability. A bibliometric analysis of scientific literature shows an increasing interest in circular UM as a comprehensive approach to managing energy and material flows in urban settings. This article aims to further explore the transition from a linear to a circular model by reviewing the evolution of the urban metabolism concept, its key components, and relevant case studies from cities that have successfully implemented circular strategies. By identifying barriers and challenges cities face in adopting circular practices within their urban metabolism, the article proposes recommendations to overcome these obstacles. Furthermore, it examines the interrelationships between circular UM and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in terms of sustainable urban planning and energy transition. However, important challenges remain, such as the lack of standardised and accessible data that hinder comparisons between cities and their evolution. Finally, future lines of research are proposed that focus on the integration of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and neural networks, as well as the development of circular urban models that can tangibly measure their impact on climate change. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art of UM while enriching the existing body of knowledge on emerging trends in this field.

The aim is not just for any individual state or person; rather, it is a national concern. The zero carbon footprint involves cooperation from various sectors that include industries, hospitals, residential buildings, and transportation. In this study, the emphasis is on the carbon emissions impacting climate change, which in turn distracts the whole ecosystem. However, the overall SDG index score of India is 54, and CO in Anand Vihar reached 120ppm in February–March 2020. The geospatial techniques of were implemented for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The key is to save energy and reduce carbon emissions by using clean and green electricity.

AB  - Background The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations set targets to address global social, economic, and environmental issues. The food industry is crucial to achieving SDGs due to its impact on hunger, health, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. Conventional food processing falls short of these goals, necessitating alternative technologies, such as ohmic heating, a key technology capable of driving the food industry in a sustainable direction. Scope and approach This review aims to explain various aspects attained from the application of ohmic heating correlated with the SDGs. Key findings and conclusion Literature analysis shows that ohmic heating could significantly contribute to SDGs 2 (zero hunger), 3 (good health and well-being), 6 (clean water and sanitation), 7 (affordable and clean energy), 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 13 (climate action), among other goals. These could be achieved because of the ohmic process's capability to increase the production yield (e.g., pectin by 8.9%; essential oil by 51.2%) and shelf-life (e.g., pasteurized milk by 1.7 times), produce healthier and more nutritious products (e.g., dried quince with 2 times phenolics), reduce food waste through valorization (e.g., transforming lemon peel to pectin and essential oil), enhance production infrastructure due to improved energy efficiency (e.g., 72.8% in evaporation process). Unique insights into ohmic heating's mechanistic principles, scalability challenges, and integration with other approaches (e.g., renewable energy systems and artificial intelligence) are presented. The review identifies critical research gaps and proposes a future research roadmap to improve its industrial applicability and expand its practical role in achieving SDGs.

AB  - The study is focused on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 8, and 13. At the nexus of energy consumption, economic growth, and carbon emissions, we investigated the interactive effect of energy consumption and economic growth on carbon emissions for seventeen selected African countries using static panel estimation techniques using annual data from 2000 to 2017. The result shows that an increase in energy consumption positively affects economic growth and negatively affects carbon emissions. However, the impact of energy consumption on economic growth is greater than its adverse environmental effect. We found that economic growth (due to the energy transition in Africa) reduces or dampens the negative effect of energy usage on the environment (indirectly, mitigating carbon emissions). A notable implication of our finding is that the transition to renewable energy is moderating the adverse effects of increasing energy consumption and economic growth on the environment. So, in applying the energy intensity theory to sub-Saharan Africa, a modification is proposed: carbon emissions are directly proportional to the amount of fossil fuel energy consumed per unit of output. We recommend the prioritization of economic growth and productive use of energy towards effectively reducing the negative impact of energy consumption on the environment. Future studies could consider increasing the number of countries, and, if data is available, an artificial intelligence experiment could be undertaken to check the reliability of previous results. We also suggest that future studies consider investigating the persistence of emissions using energy and growth as key independent and moderating variables.

To this end, the present study examined the possible consequences of the widespread use of energy-intensive crypto-asset technologies, focusing on those that rely heavily on non-renewable energy sources. The analytical results demonstrated that the interconnectedness between cryptocurrency-based digital innovations and sustainable investments was most pronounced in bull markets characterized by high returns and upper tails, except for the Dash Green market. Bitcoin and Stellar exhibited the strongest connections with eco-friendly financial ventures across various market states, indicating their robust interplay with sustainable portfolios. The total connectedness index using an Elman neural network revealed that higher non-linear dynamic information was associated with green-synthesized cryptocurrency-driven innovations, compared with other digital innovations. This study contributes to scholarly understanding of the interconnectedness between cryptocurrency-based digital innovations and sustainable investments by elucidating their dynamics under different market conditions. These findings underscore the need for further analysis to fully comprehend the intricate relationship between these assets, particularly across different quantile levels, as well as to inform sound investment decisions in sustainable finance.

AB  - Dry laboratories (dry labs) are laboratories dedicated to using and creating data (they are data-centric). Several aspects of the minerals industry (e.g., exploration, extraction and beneficiation) generate multi-scale and multivariate data that are ultimately used to make decisions. Dry labs and digitalization are closely and intricately linked in the minerals industry. This paper focuses on the instrumentation and infrastructure that are required for accelerating digital transformation initiatives in the minerals sector. Specifically, we are interested in the ability of current and emerging instrumentation, sensors and infrastructure to capture relevant information, generate and transport high-quality data. We provide an essential examination of existing literature and an understanding of the 21st century minerals industry. Critical analysis of the literature and review of the current configuration of the minerals industry revealed similar data management and infrastructure needs for all segments of the minerals industry. There are, however, differences in the tools and equipment used at different stages of the mineral value chain. As demand for data-driven approaches grows, and as data resulting from each segment of the minerals industry continues to increase in abundance, diversity and dimensionality, the tools that manage and utilize such data should evolve in a way that is more transdisciplinary (e.g., data management, artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science). Ideally, data should be managed in a dry lab environment, but minerals industry data is currently and historically disaggregated. Consequently, digitalization in the minerals industry must be coupled with dry laboratories through a systematic transition. Sustained generation of high-quality data is critical to sustain the highly desirable uses of data, such as artificial intelligence-based insight generation.

AB  - The regulatory of task classification or clustering and hybrid containers in cloud data centers has a lower overhead of cost compared to virtual machines, also it has a direct impact on the load balance, accessibility of virtual machines, and increase of efficiency. Therefore, additional resources with high computing power usage are one of the important issues. In the proposed method merging the index parameters of response time, execution accuracy and their sensitivity rate have been used. In TPMCD(ThroughPut and cost optimizing Method for Clustering tasks and hybrid containers in the cloud Data center), customers agreement, as a service and performance of the connection, the efficiency of service quality and reliability of algorithms, requests, and confirmations (short, medium, long) due to the configuration of resources and containers and the intelligent detector threshold, protection of the increase in system efficiency and energy consumption decrease synchronously against dynamic workloads and changes in user requests. Classification and re-clustering of tasks in the algorithm have led to an improvement in the real execution time compared to the execution time of the studied algorithms. In the proposed method, by correctly allocating resources for scoring unbalanced data for allocating resources and applications and communicating between containers. In TPMCD, parameters of weight, size, and scoring are used in assigning tasks to processing resources. Confidence interval has been done in proposed method due to the possibility of a small difference in scheduling between different virtual machines. In the TPMCD algorithm, choosing the right VM and reducing the critical points, in the hosts where the load imbalance is created, the load balance is optimized by considering the sensitivity rate and scoring the average tasks. TPMCD method have optimized time and cost by decreasing redundancy. From the obtained results in the evaluation, this method performed better than other ones 7% in cost, 4% in throughput, and 9.5% in real execution time on average simultaneously. Finally, the proposed approach was 3% better than the KC method in the number of nodes used.

AB  - Prediction of bunker fuel spot prices at a port and understanding the dependence on key determinants is an arduous and challenging activity. The present work strives to analyze the temporal spectrum of daily spot prices of Very Low Sulphur fuel Oil (VLSFO), a critical bunker fuel, in five European Ports, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Gothenburg, Hamburg, and Rotterdam. The lack of prior research in the allied domain has motivated to undertake the modeling of VLSFO spot prices through the lens of applied predictive analytics. The Least Square Boosting (LSBoost) and Facebook Prophet algorithms are used to draw forecasts in multivariate framework leveraging constructs related to the same fuel prices at different ports, different fuel prices at the same ports, economic indicator, etc. The dynamics have been explicitly examined during the Russia-Ukraine military conflict. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) frameworks have been used to demystify the influence of the chosen explanatory variables at a granular scale. The overall findings espouse the effectiveness of the predictive framework in accurately estimating spot prices of VLSFO in any of the selected ports, and the same heavily depends on VLSFO prices at different ports.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) methods, and in particular machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), Bayesian nets (BNs), and probabilistic reasoning are offering new tools for computer-assisted drug design (CADD). AI methods are accompanying, extending, or even changing existent practices in generating and searching chemical libraries in de novo drug design, in checking for properties, in optimizing drug candidates. After considering in short the computer practices in the drug development process, open challenges are individuated. The AI methods considered include the learning methods loosely inspired by the brain structure, such as the neural networks (NN) and the derived deep learning, the applications of mathematical logic to express hierarchical knowledge, and the integration of symbols and probability to reason on data. How those AI methods are working in various CADD and clinical studies are finally presented through the analysis of some recent literature. Warnings about the limitations of the AI algorithms are also reported.

AB  - Driving simulators often lack fundamental components needed for accurate simulation of energy dynamics. We introduce EcoSimLab, a comprehensive electric vehicle driving simulation framework consisting of (1) a simulation of electric vehicle energy dynamics, (2) an optimization-based approach of structuring eco-driving behaviors, (3) a synthetic driver module as versatile benchmark model to analyze human behavior. Guided by fundamentals of energy modeling and considerations on human action regulation, we further present the development of the EcoDrivingTestPark, an exemplary set of energy-relevant scenarios to enable the analysis of individual differences in eco-driving and intervention effects (e.g., HMIs). To generate a first characterization of driving behavior, we conducted two empirical studies with human (&lt;Formula format="inline"&gt;&lt;TexMath&gt;&lt;?TeX N_textS1 = 31?&gt;&lt;/TexMath&gt;&lt;AltText&gt;Math 1&lt;/AltText&gt;&lt;File name="automotiveui24-4-inline1" type="svg"/&gt;&lt;/Formula&gt;, &lt;Formula format="inline"&gt;&lt;TexMath&gt;&lt;?TeX N_textS2a = 41?&gt;&lt;/TexMath&gt;&lt;AltText&gt;Math 2&lt;/AltText&gt;&lt;File name="automotiveui24-4-inline2" type="svg"/&gt;&lt;/Formula&gt;) and synthetic drivers (&lt;Formula format="inline"&gt;&lt;TexMath&gt;&lt;?TeX N_textS2b = 3?&gt;&lt;/TexMath&gt;&lt;AltText&gt;Math 3&lt;/AltText&gt;&lt;File name="automotiveui24-4-inline3" type="svg"/&gt;&lt;/Formula&gt;). Results indicate substantial variations in driver behavior and considerable challenges for human drivers to achieve synthetic driver performance. Implications for augmenting human action regulation in eco-driving are discussed.

AB  - The increasing concern about the environmental performance and sustainability of firms and organizations also involves educational institutions. If universities aim to become leaders in sustainability aspects, they must adopt strategies that involve the entire university system. As a useful tool for this purpose, the objective of this study was to calculate the carbon footprint for the University of Castilla-La Mancha for the period 2005–2013. The calculation of the university carbon footprint was accomplished through a hybrid environmentally extended input–output model in a multiregional framework, which constitutes a novelty of the analysis. The proposed tool also allows the calculation of the potential for emissions reduction of abatement measures. The carbon footprint induced by the consumption of university employees' wages is also undertaken as a way to increase awareness and university outreach to society. The results show the relevance of both imports and indirect emissions and highlight the significance of energy-related emissions enabled by sectors such as renting, electrical and optical equipment, manufacturing or even services.

Our study delves into pioneering an advanced energy management system tailored for forthcoming smart homes and grids. This system harnesses deep learning methodologies to predict consumer energy consumption. Leveraging a Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) connection, we established an Internet of Things (IoT) network supported by Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) for efficient data transfer. Our approach integrated the Jetson Nano Developer Kit for deep learning tasks, utilized Raspberry Pi as a home management server (HMS), and employed Espressif Systems' microcontrollers (ESP-01, NodeMCU, ESP32) to impart intelligence to household devices. Actual house measurements were collected and rigorously analyzed, demonstrating promising outcomes in deep learning, control, and monitoring applications. This management system's potential extends to empowering future smart homes and is a crucial component for demand-side energy management in forthcoming intelligent grids.

This pattern creates product transformation cycles, that allow to re-use parts and renew energy, defining Circular Economy Ecosystems. Such cycles, are very interesting systems from a performance evaluation point of view: in this paper we give a Colored Petri Net perspective to circular economy. In particular, we focus on an example taken from the literature that considers car manufacturing, and we show how we can deal with the problem using standard performance evaluation techniques. Results from performance analysis of the case study, allow to focus on new interesting metrics and performance indicators, that might not be fully studied with conventional techniques applied by expert of the economical domain.

AB  - A fundamental goal of datacenter networking is to efficiently interconnect a large number of servers in a cost-effective way. Inspired by the commodity servers in today’s data centers that come with dual-port, we consider how to design low-cost, robust, and symmetrical network structures for containerized data centers with dual-port servers and low-end switches. In this paper, we propose a family of such network structure called a DCube, including H-DCube and M-DCube. The DCube consists of one or multiple interconnected sub-networks, each of which is a compound graph made by interconnecting a certain number of basic building blocks by means of a hypercube-like graph. More precisely, the H-DCube and M-DCube utilize the hypercube and 1-möbius cube, respectively, while the M-DCube achieves a considerably higher aggregate bottleneck throughput compared to H-DCube. Mathematical analysis and simulation results show that the DCube exhibits graceful performance degradation as the failure rate of server or switch increases. Moreover, the DCube significantly reduces the required wires and switches compared to the BCube and fat-tree. In addition, the DCube achieves a higher speedup than the BCube does for the one-to-several traffic patterns. The proposed methodologies in this paper can be applied to the compound graph of the basic building block and other hypercube-like graphs, such as Twisted cube, Flip MCube, and fastcube.

AB  - Accurate energy consumption prediction models can bring tremendous benefits to building energy efficiency, where the use of data-driven models allows models to be trained based on historical data and to obtain better prediction performance. However, a severe problem has been overlooked where the dynamic spatiotemporal dependence among buildings is often not considered. To settle this issue, this study proposes an asymmetric encoder-decoder learning framework where the spatial relationships and time-series features between multiple buildings are extracted by a convolutional neural network and a gated recurrent neural network to form new input data in the encoder. The decoder then makes predictions based on the input data with an attention mechanism. The model is trained and tested with energy consumption data from 10 different buildings at a university in China. The results show that our proposed model maintains high accuracy using small datasets while predicting different types of buildings, achieving an average R2 of 0.964. Additionally, the accuracy loss in multi-step forecasting is considerably ameliorated by maintaining an average R2 of 0.915 predicting 3 steps ahead of time. Benefiting from the asymmetric encoder-decoder structure, the proposed algorithm resolves the problem of accuracy loss using deep learning in a small dataset and multi-step time series forecasting. Further assisted by the anomaly detection function, the algorithm serves as a reliable guide for the user to effectively manage and control energy consumption in buildings.

AB  - As scientists living through a climate emergency, we have a responsibility to lead by example, or to at least be consistent with our understanding of the problem. This common goal of reducing the carbon footprint of our work can be approached through a variety of strategies. For theoreticians, this includes not only optimizing algorithms and improving computational efficiency but also adopting a frugal approach to modeling. Here we present and critically illustrate this principle. First, we compare two models of very different level of sophistication which nevertheless yield the same qualitative agreement with an experiment involving electric manipulation of molecular spin qubits while presenting a difference in cost of >4 orders of magnitude. As a second stage, an already minimalistic model of the potential use of single-ion magnets to implement a network of probabilistic p-bits, programmed in two different programming languages, is shown to present a difference in cost of a factor of ≃50. In both examples, the computationally expensive version of the model was the one that was published. As a community, we still have a lot of room for improvement in this direction.

AB  - Radiofrequency identification (RFID) raises significant privacy concerns as it allows automated identification possibly without knowledge or permission of the tag bearer. Traditional cryptographic operations, such as authentication and encryption, to prevent unauthorized read are too costly for RFID tags to be deployed into cost-sensitive applications, e.g., into item-level applications in supply chains. This paper addresses the privacy issues and demonstrates a solution which achieves high security while maintains low manufacturing and management cost. The RFID tags carry only ID numbers which are disguised in response through randomization and a hash function to avoid clandestine tracking. The response of ID numbers is divided into segments to reduce database computational complexity. The database stores and maintains the inventory information to avoid clandestine inventorying. Also, the burden of cryptographic operations shifts from tags to database, tags will thus be cheap to manufacture and manage.

AB  - Resource constraint is something that restricts the development of things due to resource shortages and environmental damage. The development of equipment also faces the resource constraint seriously. For example, the fossil energy and traditional metal resources will run out in a limited period and the activities in equipment life cycle bears inescapable responsibility to environmental pollution. Some issues those lead to equipment non-sustainable development are exposed in the rigorous situation of resource constraint. First, almost all the main equipment use oil as energy and that is irrational energy consumption structure because it is highly dependent on the fossil energy which will run out sooner or later. Second, there is massive consumption of all types of materials in equipment construction, but a lot of waste equipment do not be reused or disposed appropriately resulted in substantial waste of resources. Third, it will have a lot of waste emissions in all sectors of equipment life cycle such as manufacturing, storage, using, maintenance and waste disposal, resulted in serious environmental pollution. The mean of equipment sustainable development based on resource constraint is that the development of equipment can break through the bottleneck of resource constraint and achieve harmony with the resources and environment. The fundamental approach to achieve that goal is to implement the equipment resource-ability design. The resource-ability is a kind of design attributes of equipment, and it can be defined like this: the capabilities of alleviating resource shortage and environmental hazards, promoting resource economization and environment-friendly, on the basis of meeting every military demand. The main idea of equipment resource-ability design is that: take the resource using and environmental impacting into equipment design, and make sure the equipment born with resource-conserving and environment-friendly genes, in order to promote the coordination of equipment, resource and environment, and to advance equipment sustainable development. Resource-ability design should adopt some design ideas. First, resource substituting: substituting new-type energy for fossil energy; substituting recycled metal for original exploited metal; substituting advanced materials for traditional material; substituting green materials for environmental endangered materials. Second, intensive integration: improving resource utilization efficiency through rational design methods by the considering of function and structure. Third, environment protection: reducing the environment endangering through some approach such as adoption of green material, improvement of the function and structure in equipment design.

AB  - To achieve the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goal, substituting fossil energy with electricity (named as ‘electric energy substitution’ in this paper) to improve the electrification becomes an important way to promote low-carbon transformation. To achieve the low-carbon goal, the development path of the electrification will be transformed from the natural evolution to the low-carbon goal-driven pattern. The traditional methods of predicting the electrification development based on historical data fail to obtain the results that meet the low-carbon goals. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a low-carbon goal-oriented model for optimizing the electrification development. Specifically, an optimization model is built with embedded carbon emission constraints, electrification rate constraints, energy consumption mix constraints, and technical potential constraints. And the objective function is to minimize the electric energy substitution cost and carbon emission cost. The proposed method considers both the low-carbon goal and the technical feasibility, and the results can meet the technical economy. Case studies take the field of building operation as the object, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper presents four different types of energy-efficient CS-PRNGs designed in a 28nm CMOS process using high-level synthesis (HLS). Thanks to HLS, design space is efficiently explored by sweeping the microarchitectural parameters through which the optimal implementation is found. Performance of the designed CS-PRNGs is found to be comparable to that of prior art based on manually coded RTL implementations.

AB  - With the rapid development of prepaid consumption, the problem of prepaid funds being occupied by individual merchants is increasingly prominent. In order to effectively solve this risk, this paper explores the innovative combination of digital RMB and smart contract technology. The article first elaborates the theoretical basis of smart contracts and digital currencies, and then proposes smart contract design schemes for prepaid consumption scenarios such as supply chain settlement and distribution refund, including using Solidity language to write code, setting payment trigger conditions, etc. In the deployment execution process, the article clarifies specific steps such as compilation, release, and user access to achieve automatic supervision and payment of funds. Although smart contracts still face privacy and security issues, the combination of digital RMB and smart contracts provides an innovative solution for the prepaid consumption field through continuous optimization of technical solutions and improvement of regulations, which is of great practical significance.

AB  - Given the current paradigm in the field of sustainable mobility, an urgent need to modernize public transport systems, has become undoubtably vital. The increasing concerns regarding climate change and the tightening of emissions standards, have directed public transport operators towards the large-scale adoption of alternative propulsion vehicles. The most notable option in this area are Battery Electric Buses (BEBs), a mean of transport that has gained tremendous popularity in the past decade. However, Fuel Cell Electric Buses (FCEBs) emerged as a prospective option in this sector. The aim of this paper is to provide a thorough assessment between these alternative transport solutions, with the ultimate goal of determining the energy efficiency of both BEBs and FCEBs.

AB  - Wall-climbing robots with tracked locomotion and magnetic adhesion are still a challenging area of research. This study focuses on understanding how varying the duty cycle affects power consumption in such robots. A prototype was tested with duty cycles ranging from 50% to 100%. Current and voltage data were collected using a Uni-T 204+ digital clamp meter and a Dekko DM179T multimeter, respectively. The robot was positioned vertically on an iron wall and allowed to climb upward. Power consumption for each duty cycle was calculated by multiplying the corresponding current and voltage values. The experimental results revealed a linear correlation between duty cycle and power consumption. As the duty cycle increased, so did the power consumption, ranging from 72.56 watts at 50% to 117.01 watts at 100%.

AB  - In 2015, the United Nations (UN) launched an ambitious set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Achieving these far-reaching goals requires effective tracking of progress across 169 targets and over 230 indicators. Furthermore, adopted in 2015, Africa Agenda 2063 is a strategic framework developed by the African Union (AU) to optimize the use of the continent’s resources for sustainable and inclusive growth. It aims to deliver on key aspirations shared by African nations including a high standard of living, well-educated citizens, good governance, strong cultural identity, and Africa’s strong voice in global affairs. Built around 20 goals and seven priority areas, Agenda 2063 provides a shared vision and roadmap for socioeconomic transformation in Africa over the next 50 years. However, numerous countries in Africa face considerable challenges in collecting, timely, granular, high-quality data to adequately monitor SDG metrics. Traditional data sources like surveys and administrative records often have gaps, especially at subnational levels. As a result, national statistics offices, particularly in Africa, lack the data needed to properly inform SDG-related policies and interventions.

AB  - Building operations represent a significant percentage of the total primary energy consumed in most countries due to the proliferation of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) installations in response to the growing demand for improved thermal comfort. Reducing the associated energy consumption while maintaining comfortable conditions in buildings are conflicting objectives and represent a typical optimization problem that requires intelligent system design. Over the last decade, different methodologies based on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been deployed to find the sweet spot between energy use in HVAC systems and suitable indoor comfort levels to the occupants. This paper performs a comprehensive and an in-depth systematic review of AI-based techniques used for building control systems by assessing the outputs of these techniques, and their implementations in the reviewed works, as well as investigating their abilities to improve the energy-efficiency, while maintaining thermal comfort conditions. This enables a holistic view of (1) the complexities of delivering thermal comfort to users inside buildings in an energy-efficient way, and (2) the associated bibliographic material to assist researchers and experts in the field in tackling such a challenge. Among the 20 AI tools developed for both energy consumption and comfort control, functions such as identification and recognition patterns, optimization, predictive control. Based on the findings of this work, the application of AI technology in building control is a promising area of research and still an ongoing, i.e., the performance of AI-based control is not yet completely satisfactory. This is mainly due in part to the fact that these algorithms usually need a large amount of high-quality real-world data, which is lacking in the building or, more precisely, the energy sector. Based on the current study, from 1993 to 2020, the application of AI techniques and personalized comfort models has enabled energy savings on average between 21.81 and 44.36%, and comfort improvement on average between 21.67 and 85.77%. Finally, this paper discusses the challenges faced in the use of AI for energy productivity and comfort improvement, and opens main future directions in relation with AI-based building control systems for human comfort and energy-efficiency management.

AB  - The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing neuropharmacology and drug development, allowing the modulation of neurotransmitter systems at the personal level. This review focuses on the neuropharmacology and regulation of neurotransmitters using predictive modeling, closed-loop neuromodulation, and precision drug design. The fusion of AI with applications such as machine learning, deep-learning, and even computational modeling allows for the real-time tracking and enhancement of biological processes within the body. An exemplary application of AI is the use of DeepMind's AlphaFold to design new GABA reuptake inhibitors for epilepsy and anxiety. Likewise, Benevolent AI and IBM Watson have fast-tracked drug repositioning for neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, we identified new serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression through AI screening. In addition, the application of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) settings using AI for patients with Parkinson's disease and for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) using reinforcement learning-based transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) leads to better treatment. This review highlights other challenges including algorithm bias, ethical concerns, and limited clinical validation. Their proposal to incorporate AI with optogenetics, CRISPR, neuroprosthesis, and other advanced technologies fosters further exploration and refinement of precision neurotherapeutic approaches. By bridging computational neuroscience with clinical applications, AI has the potential to revolutionize neuropharmacology and improve patient-specific treatment strategies. We addressed critical challenges, such as algorithmic bias and ethical concerns, by proposing bias auditing, diverse datasets, explainable AI, and regulatory frameworks as practical solutions to ensure equitable and transparent AI applications in neurotransmitter modulation.

AB  - This paper surveys the published work on how blockchain technology will impact accounting in general, but AI-enabled auditing specifically. The purpose is to investigate how blockchain technology can improve transparency and trust in accounting practice and how professionals can use blockchain data to improve decision-making, based on the qualities of immutability, append-only, shared, verified, and agreed-upon (i.e., consensus-driven) blockchain data. The multi-party validation of blockchain protocols adds real-time trusted data for the AI systems used by auditors to improve assurance and efficiency. This review summarizes four themes emerging from the literature focusing on how blockchain technology has changed record-keeping in accounting: event approach to accounting; real-time accounting; triple entry-accounting and continuous auditing. The research interprets the findings using agency theory and stakeholder theory to advance how using blockchain to mitigate information asymmetry and improve stakeholder collaborations is understood. The investigation also summarizes the challenges and clarifies organizations’ reasons to be cautious about adopting blockchain. Lastly, the study suggests that future researchers use this study in two ways that enrich blockchain literature: first, to apply the themes and answer the questions identified within this review to improve the business methods of practitioners and policymakers; and second, to encourage stakeholders such as practitioners, system designers/developers, and policymakers to collaborate in designing blockchain ecosystems that suit accounting and auditing as they transform digitally.

AB  - Delivery of health care, including medical imaging, generates substantial global greenhouse gas emissions. The cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) community has an opportunity to decrease our carbon footprint, mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, and develop resiliency to current and future impacts of climate change. The goal of this document is to review and recommend actions and strategies to allow for CMR operation with improved sustainability, including efficient CMR protocols and CMR imaging workflow strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy, and waste, and to decrease reliance on finite resources, including helium and waterbody contamination by gadolinium-based contrast agents. The article also highlights the potential of artificial intelligence and new hardware concepts, such as low-helium and low-field CMR, in achieving these aims. Specific actions include powering down magnetic resonance imaging scanners overnight and when not in use, reducing low-value CMR, and implementing efficient, non-contrast, and abbreviated CMR protocols when feasible. Data on estimated energy and greenhouse gas savings are provided where it is available, and areas of future research are highlighted.

AB  - Effectively managing and optimizing energy resources to accommodate population growth while minimizing carbon emissions has become increasingly intricate. A proficient approach to this dilemma is accurately predicting energy usage and emissions across diverse sectors. This paper unveils a genetic algorithm (GA)-optimized support vector regression (SVR) model designed to (i) predict electricity generation, (ii) predict energy consumption in four primary sectors—residential, industrial, commercial, and agricultural, and (iii) estimate sector-specific carbon emissions. The proposed model's efficacy is assessed by calculating the R2 value, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and residual plot. The model achieved high accuracy in predicting energy generation, with an MAE of 1.18 %, and yielded reliable sectoral consumption predictions, reflected in MAE values of 1.22 % (residential), 4.98 % (industrial), 4.40 % (commercial), and 4.04 % (agricultural). The residuals exhibited homoscedasticity, and the R2 value approached one. The model predicts that by 2027, the residential sector will consume 55748.66 GWh of energy, the commercial sector 14892.49 GWh, the industrial sector 32642.35 GWh, and the agricultural sector 2288.37 GWh. It has been predicted that by 2027, these four sectors will release 75437.96-billion-gram carbon equivalents.

AB  - Increased demand for medical supplies, and specifically respirators and face masks, during the Covid-19 pandemic along with the inability of legitimate suppliers to meet these needs created a window of opportunity for counterfeiters to capitalize on the supply chain disruptions caused by a global health crisis. Both legitimate and illicit businesses began shifting their scope from sectors such as textiles to producing and distributing personal protective equipment (PPE), many of which were counterfeit or unauthentic products and thus unable to properly protect users. To study cost-effective disruption strategies, this study proposes a simulation-optimization framework. The framework is used to model counterfeiters' behavior and analyze the effectiveness of different disruption strategies for counterfeit PPE supply chains during the Covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - To improve the thermal management of a data center, fin-type water-cooled heat sinks were applied to cool the chips in a server cabinet, and a water-cooled system based on the cooling tower of a data center with a thermal power of 4.8 kW was applied. TRNSYS was used to conduct an effect analysis of the operating condition parameters of the cooling water on the power consumption of the system. Finally, the operating conditions of the cooling water were optimized by minimizing the energy consumption of the water-cooled system. In addition, the factors of different safety chip temperatures and partial thermal loads were considered in optimizing the working conditions and analyzing cooling energy consumption. The results show that the optimal cooling water operating parameters significantly differ corresponding to different safety chip temperatures and thermal loads. Finally, the fitting correlation equations of the optimal flow rate of the primary and secondary cooling water under different safe chip temperatures and partial thermal loads are provided to guide the cooling system design. Considering an ambient temperature of 15 °C and a safety chip temperature of 70 °C as a case study, the optimal primary and secondary cooling water flow rates of 3 and 3.4 L/min, respectively, were obtained, with a minimum power usage effectiveness of 1.146.

AB  - In the contemporary world, the escalating apprehensions about energy consumption's ecological repercussions have spurred urgent attention. The strategic anticipation of energy consumption trends holds pivotal importance in steering efficient energy use and curtailing the release of carbon emissions. In this comprehensive study, we proffer a novel approach, leveraging two-time series models, namely VAR (Vector Auto regression) and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), to meticulously dissect data gleaned from a smart industry context. The study's focal objective is the forecast of both energy consumption patterns and CO2 emissions, thereby illuminating the prowess of time series models in this predictive endeavor. As the crux of our investigation, we embarked on a comparative analysis of the efficacy inherent in these models. Our findings emphatically underscore the commendable predictive capacity of the ARIMA model in delineating energy consumption forecasts. Remarkably, the optimal configuration for the ARIMA model was determined as (p=1, d=1, q=0), delineating its reliance on a single antecedent value of the dependent variable and a singular differencing operation for precise forecasting. The ARIMA model further distinguished itself by manifesting a trifecta of diminutive metrics: Minimal Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Such trifling metrics underscore the model's adeptness in extrapolating forthcoming energy consumption patterns with commendable accuracy. The discerning residual analysis fortified our model's credibility, as it showcased the random dispersion of errors, a testament to the model's prowess in encapsulating all pertinent data intricacies. our study underscores the instrumental role of time series models, specifically ARIMA, in proficiently prognosticating energy consumption trends. This empirical evidence serves as a clarion call for adopting these models in analogous domains to ameliorate energy consumption strategies, thereby orchestrating a harmonious accord between human progress and ecological preservation.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental investigation conducted on a new single-phase immersion/liquid-cooling technique developed at the OVHcloud laboratory, combining a direct-to-chip water-cooling system with passive single-immersion cooling technology. The experimental setup tested the impact of three dielectric fluids (S5X, SmartCoolant and ThermaSafe R), the effect of the water circuit configuration, and the server power/profile. Results suggest that the system cooling demand depends on the fluid's viscosity. As the viscosity increased from 4.6 to 9.8 mPa s, the cooling performance decreased by approximately 6%. Moreover, all the IT server profiles were validated at various water inlet temperatures and flow rates. The energy performance of the proposed technique and the liquid-cooling system previously used by OVHcloud was compared at a 600 kW data centre (DC). The proposed technique showed a reduction in the DC electrical power consumption by at least 20.7% compared to the liquid-cooling system. Finally, the cooling performance of the air- and liquid-cooled systems and the proposed solution was compared computationally at the server level. When using the proposed solution, the energy consumed per server was reduced by at least 20% compared with the air-cooling system and 7% compared with liquid-cooling system.

AB  - In recent year, Asia has rapid economic growth and policy makers care about the renewable energy consumption. The motivation about the choice of variables with theory and empirical backing on the subject in the manuscript is the theory of Cobb- Douglas function and determinants of renewable energy consumption in the Asian countries. This paper investigates the nexus of electricity consumption, fossil fuel consumption, foreign direct investment inflows, economic growth, and renewable energy consumption in Asian countries. Utilizing panel data analysis, the study finds significant interrelationships among these factors and highlights their implications for energy policy and sustainable development in the region. This article aims to use the Cobb- Douglas Model to analyze the factors affecting renewable energy consumption at Asian developed countries for sustainable development goals. This study collected data from World Bank in the period 2000–2020 of 06 developed countries such as Japan, Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Israel and China. The empirical research results show that the electricity consumption, fossil fuel consumption, foreign direct investment inflows, economic growth affect the environmental pollution in 06 Asian developed countries. The electricity consumption, foreign direct investment inflows, economic growth positively affect to the renewable energy consumption. If the electricity consumption increases 1 % then the renewable energy consumption up 0.6 %; if the foreign direct investment inflows up 1 % then the renewable energy consumption up 0.82 %; If the economic growth up 1 % then renewable energy up 2.73 %. In addition, fossil fuel consumption negatively affects the renewable energy consumption. If the fossil fuel consumption increases 1 % then the renewable energy consumption down 0.26 %. The paper offers conclusions and recommendations for Asian countries to address these interconnected issues and transition towards a more sustainable energy future.

AB  - Moving towards a green economy, sustainable energy consumption and financial development amid mounting risks moved to center stage of policymaking and academia. Strengthening energy consumption from renewable sources is integral to the attainment of the overarching sustainable development goals of the Paris Agreement. The study employs data from 19 OECD economies spanning from 1990 to 2020 to explore the effect of risks on sustainable energy consumption. Using a multifaceted empirical approach -- comprising Panel OLS, MG estimators, quantile regression analysis and local projection approach -- results establish a key role for political, economic and financial risks in determining energy consumption from renewable sources. Results for the impact of finance indicators on sustainable energy consumption provide robust, though mixed, findings on how to bridge the climate financing gap. Our findings underscore the significant positive influence of human capital development, economic growth, economic openness and oil prices on sustainable energy use. It is further shown that decreasing carbon emissions and making sustainable energy more affordable should be on the central agenda of policymaking for promoting environmental sustainability. A multi-lever strategy is needed when making environmental policies while distributional heterogeneity should also be considered.

AB  - With the rapid development and maturation of basic research in related fields such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a policy hotspot of high interest in all major economies. Furthermore, the governance of application scenarios has become one of the important topics of AI governance policy research. The practice of AI governance policy depends on a change in the paradigm of relevant governance policy research theories, and there is an urgent need to empirically analyze the structural characteristics of the knowledge evolution of AI application scenarios. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of the basic research trends in autonomous vehicles, which is one of the most important application scenarios of AI. The study empirically analyzes the relevant literature data from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases of Web of Science, based on both technical and social dimensions through the knowledge mapping analysis tools in Bibliometrix (in R environment). Based on the empirical analysis, the results show that the basic research on autonomous vehicles is characterized by strong data-driven innovation under the influence of AI. The fusion of AI and basic research on autonomous vehicles has become a major driver of knowledge innovation in this domain while there is a lack of the integration of social science research.

AB  - As countries worldwide seek to reach net zero emissions within the coming decades, data center sustainability measures are becoming increasingly important as these facilities consume substantial amounts of electricity to support globally expanding digital infrastructure. Yet, local renewable energy production and waste heat utilization are still rarely used in data centers, even though recent high electricity prices have considerably increased the economic value of self-generation and energy efficiency investments. The benefits and cost-effectiveness of data center sustainability measures have also not yet been thoroughly researched in cold-climate regions, where the data center industry is currently growing rapidly. Thus, this paper assesses how solar photovoltaics (PV) and waste heat utilization can effectively be integrated into different cold climate data centers, with a case study analyzing data centers in Finland and northern Japan. The modelled results indicate that solar PV systems can cost-effectively be used to provide renewable electricity to data centers in both Finland and northern Japan, with electricity prices having the largest influence on economic performance. The use of larger external PV systems is shown to be cost-effective at the higher electricity prices seen in 2022, whereas smaller rooftop PV systems and grid electricity provide more economic benefits at 2019 price levels. Selling surplus PV electricity to the grid and using waste heat for district heating is also shown to be effective in data centers located in Finland, whereas battery storage and snow melting are better suited to utilize surplus PV electricity and data center waste heat in northern Japan.

AB  - Cancer Care Informatics (CCI) and its impacts are assessed using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The positive and negative impacts of CCI on the SDGs are considered through a literature review and expert assessment. There has not been a prior publication of such an assessment and this could contribute to more holistic governance of CCI. The paper reviews the individual SDGs along with consideration of the 17 SDGs as a whole. Whilst the relationship of CCI with the achievement of SDG3 (Good Health and Well-Being) is the obvious impact, CCI also has impacts on other underpinning targets or indicators within the SDG framework. For example, the Greenhouse Gas emissions from the electricity consumed by CCI computer systems will have a negative effect on SDG13 Climate Change. Using the SDG lens helps us to identify the other direct and indirect impacts of CCI on Sustainable Development and affords the opportunity to manage deliberately such impacts as improving equality of access, elimination of modern slavery and delivering CCI education.

Energy efficiency progress has been evaluated since 2000, using official data from Eurostat and Bulgaria National Statistical Institute. The share of energy consumption in residential buildings by 2016 in the EU amounts to approximately 40% of total power consumption, which is the first largest consumer sector. The article discusses together data, policies and legislative marks for a desired change in the sector. It is well known that the process of energy demand is very dynamic, so basic indicators are presented that determine the impact of various factors on energy consumption. Results are also presented showing the impact of policies on energy consumption and efficiency.

AB  - People need food, energy and water for survival and prosperity. However, it is a challenge to meet the demand for these necessities because urbanization and climate change impacts are destroying food, energy and water systems. Resource optimization in one sector can undermine security in another due to competition for the same resources. Therefore, multiobjective optimization approaches have been used to understand the complexity associated with the Food, Energy Water Nexus. However most of these approaches focus on either maximizing resource production or minimizing resource consumption in the FEW Nexus. Maximizing production and minimizing consumption of resources simultaneously are two conflicting objectives that have not been well addressed by existing multiobjective optimization approaches. Therefore, it is difficult for these approaches to recognize feedback and cascading effects occurring in the FEW Nexus due to the interdependencies of the food, energy and water. For Sustainability of the FEW Nexus to be achieved, sustainable consumption and production of the resources within it need to be emphasized. Therefore, a novel multiobjective optimization approach that can explore alternative ways of both maximizing production and minimizing consumption simultaneously is proposed. This approach can be implemented using an Agent Based Evolutionary Algorithm as future work.

AB  - Most of the systems used all over the world are already associated with energy. Due to this fact, energy is being generated from renewable sources like solar and wind. Mainly through fossil fuels, which have now affected our climate over the years, causing damage to the ozone layer and humans through the excessive form of Carbon (CO2). Numerous countries have laid out net-zero discharge focuses as a guarantee to immediately cut ozone-harming substance emanations as the need to battle environmental change and moderate an Earth-wide temperature boost develops more critical. Due to this problem generated, it has led to the focus of this study, which is "green hydrogen; a source of anti-climate change". This study examines how green hydrogen is a superior option in contrast to petroleum derivatives with less carbon and a decent environmentally friendly power. The study cuts across the effects of green hydrogen on global climate change. In conclusion, to ensure the storage and production of green hydrogen is sustainable, researchers should be able to build a system that can store the hydrogen and utilise the environmental effects as well and the sustainability of the product.

AB  - The world confronts significant energy issues, propelled by increasing energy consumption in buildings and escalating apprehensions regarding carbon emissions from the industry. Inefficient building practices exacerbate energy instability, especially in areas experiencing increased urbanization. Nearly-zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) present an effective remedy to these challenges, markedly decreasing energy usage and carbon emissions while fostering sustainability. This research thoroughly assesses the development of NZEBs from 1995 to 2024, emphasizing design concepts, technological innovations, and their impact on energy efficiency. An analysis of key impediments to implementation reveals high prices, limited technological feasibility, regulatory limitations, and insufficient stakeholder participation. The paper examines the revolutionary impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on enhancing NZEB performance, highlighting applications such as predictive energy analytics, intelligent HVAC systems, and real-time energy management. Focusing on Egypt within the larger MENA region, this article emphasizes the unique difficulties faced by the country due to its varied climates and different stages of regulatory development. The research delineates region-specific ways to surmount challenges, including the integration of sophisticated renewable energy systems, the optimization of building envelopes, and the promotion of multi-stakeholder engagement. The results highlight the necessity for customized solutions and improved regional and worldwide cooperation to expedite the implementation of NZEBs, fostering a sustainable and resilient built environment. This analysis offers practical insights for researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders aiming to promote NZEB adoption in the MENA area and beyond.

AB  - In response to the need for high bandwidth and power efficient data center interconnection networks, different interconnects have been proposed based on the optical technology used: micro-electromechanical system (MEMS), optical cross connects (OXCs), arrayed waveguide grating routers (AWGRs) and semiconductor optical amplifier (SOAs). MEMS switches are based on mature technology, have low insertion loss and cross-talk, and are data rate independent. They are also the most scalable and the cheapest class of optical switches. However, the reconfiguration time of these switches is of the order of tens of milliseconds while fast optical switches have switching time in the range of a few nanoseconds. Fast optical switches can be based on AWGRs in conjunction with tunable wavelength converters or tunable lasers or they are based on SOAs in broadcast-and-select architecture. In this paper, we propose an optical interconnect architecture for the large scale data centers. The proposed interconnect: Hybrid Optical Switch Architecture (HOSA) is a hybrid design that features slow and fast optical switches. The hybrid design leverages strengths of both types of optical switches. To reduce complexity, we employ a single stage core topology that can be easily scaled up (in capacity) and scaled out (in the number of racks) without requiring major re-cabling and network reconfiguration. We investigate the scalability of the HOSA and show that by using a single stage core topology, it can be scaled to a hundreds of thousands of servers. We also investigate a trade-off between cost and power consumption of our design by comparing it with other well-known interconnects by using analytical modelling. We demonstrate power efficiency as compared to other conventional interconnects on account of upfront CAPEX but the additional CAPEX incurred in deploying our solution instead of traditional architecture is mitigated to some extent by reduced OPEX, due to its greater energy efficiency. We evaluate the performance of the system using network-level simulation by considering diverse workload communication patterns and system design parameters. Our results show low latency and high throughput with different workload communication patterns.

AB  - The rapid growth in urbanization and motorization generally contributes to an urban transportation system that is economically, environmentally and socially unsustainable. The result has been a relentless increase in traffic congestion. Road congestion pricing has been proposed many times as an economic measure to fight congestion in urban traffic, but has not seen widespread use in practice because of Some potential impacts of road pricing remain unknown. The paper first reviews the concept of sustainable transportation system, which should meet the goals of economic development, environmental protection and social justice collectively. And then, based on the characteristics of sustainable transportation system, how congestion pricing can contribute to economic growth, environmental protection and social justice is examined. Examination result shows that congestion pricing is a powerful way to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation system.

AB  - The paper suggests an energy efficiency benchmark for a high level monitoring in order to fulfill the energy efficiency goals of the federal government in Germany until 2020 and 2050. Based on statistical energy consumption data of the industrial sectors according to the NACE-Code classification, energy efficiency can be evaluated on different abstraction levels, resulting in aggregated indicators. At the same time the approach offers for single industrial small or medium sized enterprises (SME) to economically monitor the achieved level of energy efficiency and its development over time. This is additionally based on company specific reference values concerning annual energy consumption, turnover, gross value added and number of employees. Characteristic energy efficiency indicators are determined for the company and set in relationship to the mean values of the corresponding industrial sector. These ratio indicators can be recalculated annually and show if the single company is competitive concerning its energy efficiency level and gain. Because of the explanatory power of the suggested benchmark despite simplicity in survey and interpretation, we suggest to use it as incentive system to reward energy efficiency gains of a certain percentage above average in the industrial sector with lower taxation.

AB  - Megacities in India are historically the major economic growth centers and Kolkata is the oldest and the most densely populated mega city. An assessment of sustainable development challenges and possible green growth strategies give rise to some interesting insights that are generalisable as well. Sustainable development priority assessment for Kolkata district brings forth the issues which go beyond just green growth indicators. So in this paper we start with flagging broader multidimensional larger challenges of sustainable development based on empirical findings using composite sustainable development index. We realize this is important for final negotiation towards implementation with city-scale development decision makers. Second part of the study presents a well defined boundary for green growth. Using sector wise data base available from official sources results are derived to show which economic sector has how much green growth investment potential compared to a baseline. The potential assessment is based on effective and efficient technology deployment scope. However, case studies on behavioral response also highlight the scope of take back effect due to behavioral response parameter of rebound effect. Third part summarizes practical issues in grabbing the opportunities for green growth in a fast growing developing country context.

AB  - Social sustainability dimension in the supply chains has been addressed scarcely and very differently across the time in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) literature. Hence, the necessity of addressing social sustainability in different supply chains has been addressed by the scholars over the years. Meanwhile, the United Nations expect sustainable development across the globe by 2035 by introducing the Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) in 2015. As a result, the tremendous responsibility falls upon the shoulders of the actors of supply chains spread across the globe since businesses play a major role towards the development of the world. Hence, this research attempts at studying how the integration of UN SDGs and supply chain practices of the suppliers in the developing countries lead to better sustainable apparel supply chains. A systematic literature review followed by interviews with experts in the apparel supply chains were conducted to gather data in this study. As a result, 11 sub-topics were identified under the social sustainability dimension of sustainable supply chains followed by best practices of the Sri Lankan apparel manufacturers who also played a major role as suppliers in the ethical global apparel supply chain. Hence this study presents social sustainability practices in depth from the perspective of UN SDGs setting example for any other labor-intensive supply chains.

AB  - The collection and use of digital data by “smart city” programs raise complex operational and ethical questions that can best be addressed through carefully-monitored pilot studies before urban innovations are more widely adopted. We have created a network of single-owner campuses (academic, government, corporate and nonprofit) in the Cascadia megaregion that connects Portland (OR), Seattle (WA) and Vancouver (BC), where smart city products and services can be evaluated before deployment in neighborhoods and business districts. On the five initial campuses, we are co-locating assemblages of up to a dozen technologies through which issues of data interoperability, management, privacy and monopolization can be explored. The initial research and policy goals of this network are to educate the public about smart cities, improve accessibility for populations with disabilities, prepare city residents for natural disasters, and monitor urban tree canopies so they can better mitigate the urban heat island effect. If replicated in other regions, this testing approach can accelerate cities' responsible integration of data science solutions that can address both local and global problems.

AB  - Industrial activities are closely related to environmental issues which are displayed as frequent extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, and other intensive changes. European Green Deal is the latest European action plan to mitigate climate change and introduce sustainable development by policymakers. The environmental impact of companies is very important to meet future sustainability. One of the basic steps in the analysis of the environmental profile of the company is the identification of hot spots by using the carbon footprint methodology. The workflow and the tool for the carbon footprint methodology implementation were developed for the case of strategic planning for a medium-sized company following the standardized methodology given by the GHG Protocol. Relevant emission sources within the hot spots are identified and analyzed. The sensitivity analysis for different pre-defined scenarios is made to meet the company's mid and long-term strategic goals. Results show that the main contributors to the overall carbon footprint are purchased electricity, purchased heat, and combustion of fuels in company-owned/controlled vehicles. GHG emissions from purchased electricity and heat heavily depend on emission factors of electricity and heat sources. Also, changes in electricity and heat supply sources have a significant impact on GHG emissions.

AB  - There is abundant discourse on resilience and sustainability, however, the ongoing challenge remains how to operationalize resiliency towards achieving the inextricably interwoven (i) precepts of circular economy, with (ii) the imperatives of sustainability, and (iii) the human-centered ideals of the era of Society 5.0. Consequent upon increasing concerns for unprecedented and adverse effects of climate change, paradoxically, a significant proportion of extant literature and discourse on resiliency tends to focus on the vulnerabilities of commercial, environmental, governance, industrial and societal systems to stressors inherent within natural hazards. Unwittingly, the convention emphasizes protection from the unprecedented effects of climate change stressors, even though global, national, physical, regional and sectoral delineations of these systems are also susceptible to other volatile, uncertain, ambiguous and complex (VUCA) stressors arising from the interactions and tensions between commercial, governance, industrial and societal endeavour. The content of this paper includes discourse on the classification of VUCA events into four domains, as well as the description of a generic, logically consistent, and coherent framework for operationalizing resiliency towards sustainable futures.

AB  - Due to the limited peak load capacity of the power grid, it is difficult to absorb wind power, and enterprises with high energy consumption have special characteristics of electricity consumption. On this basis, the countermeasures for energy-intensive enterprises in the power system to participate in wind power consumption are studied. Through reasonable pricing mechanism and peak-valley load limitation, the daily electricity load of high-energy enterprises is dynamically adjusted to achieve balanced wind power generation and reduce the peak-valley difference of the power grid. According to the calculation example, compared with the conventional peaking mode, the active intervention of high energy consuming enterprises can not only improve the utilization rate of wind power generation, reduce the peak load of the grid, but also save the power cost through subsidies.

AB  - Based on the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System) model, this paper conducts an in-depth study on the path of building a new energy system in China, taking a certain province in China as an example. Taking 2022 as the base year, the study predicts the changes in energy demand and energy structure of a province from 2023 to 2060 and explores the development path of its new energy system by constructing the LEAP model. In the scenario setting, the study proposes three scenarios, all of which show that energy consumption increases and then decreases, peaking in 2050 and then declining. The medium-rate scenario shows a significant increase in the share of electricity and hydrogen consumption, with the share of end-use electricity consumption exceeding 70% and hydrogen consumption exceeding 10% by 2060, which is in line with the goal of the new energy system. The study points out that the medium-rate scenario provides a suitable path for energy transition and meets the goals of energy conservation, emission reduction and sustainable development.

AB  - The transportation industry, followed by the energy sector, emits the highest amount of carbon, which negatively impacts the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and slows down the 2050 Net-Zero target. In the UK, 78% of every household owns at least one car, thus worsening the carbon footprint statistics, including the health risks associated with the frequent use of cars. Braking of such vehicles loses the kinetic energy environment. Sustainable transport, such as cycling on pedal bicycles, can be strenuous, leading to exhaustion, fainting, accidents, or deaths. Electric- powered bicycles (or E-bikes) can mitigate these problems as the users can engage in moderate exercise void of the risks above. However, E-bikes expend the energy stored in batteries and may not suffice for distant travel. Regenerative electric braking (REB) in E-bikes can store the would-have-lost braking energy in supercapacitors to extend the travel range, battery life and efficiency. Our experimental study shows a 4.14% net gain in energy efficiency when supercapacitors are used with REB. On top of that, we show that a lightweight, low-volume REB system could be constructed at a low cost, showing that future E-bikes with a similar system could be financially viable.

AB  - Shrinking household size is a key challenge for sustainability, simultaneously decreasing sharing and increasing resource consumption. We use the Danish Household Budget Survey and carbon intensities from EXIOBASE to characterise small households in socio-demographic cohorts along the carbon footprint spectrum. Single and dual occupant households represent 77% of the Danish carbon footprint and 73% of the sample, making these households highly relevant for climate and social policy. We identify high carbon footprint cohorts to determine potential intervention targets such as wealthy males living alone and couples in suburban areas. To add emotional depth to these characteristics we provide three stories to our results. Illuminating characteristics of high impact households provides a foundation from which to design and implement interventions to reduce the carbon consequences of the growing trend towards living alone. We also characterise low carbon footprint cohorts, with specific focus on the effects of low income, disability, energy poverty, and population density. Our study makes an original contribution using storytelling, a step in the direction of increasing empathy and compassion for the various carbon footprint cohorts and working toward socially and environmentally sustainable futures.

AB  - The urgent need for low carbon emissions in hydrogen production has become increasingly critical as global energy demands rise, highlighting the inefficiencies in traditional methods and the industry's challenges in meeting evolving environmental standards. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these challenges and opportunities. The current review discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, especially machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, for process optimization in hydrogen production and associated power systems. The current study analyzes data from several important industry case studies and recently published studied evidence by using a review methodology in order to critically evaluate the effectiveness of AI applications. Key findings show how AI greatly improves operational efficiency through optimized production conditions and forecasted energy use. The review indicates that real-time data processing by AI helps to quickly detect anomalies for timely correction, minimizing downtimes and maximizing reliability. Integrating AI with energy management solutions not only optimizes hydrogen production but also supports a transition to sustainable energy systems. Thus, the current review recommends strategic investments in AI technologies and comprehensive training programs to harness their full potential, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable energy future.

AB  - Sustainability and corporate citizenship is a social ideal and a business necessity. Being sustainable is now a source of competitive advantage and a matter of corporate survival rather than a costly burden. Now many companies look on sustainability as a top-line priority. However, satisfying profit and sound corporate sustainability behavior will go unfulfilled unless orderly supply chains literally and sustainably "deliver the goods". Achieving genuine sustainability is the result of making supply chains more sustainable. Since typically 50 percent of a product's value, and often upward of 70 percent, is derived from suppliers, claims of corporate sustainability are likely just empty promises without the support from the whole supply chain. Companies and consumers realize that customers do not just buy products, they also buy the whole supply chain that delivers the products. We organize our key views in four parts. At first, after a brief introduction, we discuss the reason of building sustainable supply chains, and the relation between a sustainable firm and sustainable supply chains. Then, we described the characteristics of sustainable supply chain management, including devising a sustainable strategy, retooling the organization, managing supplier relations and monitoring and enforcing performance. Thirdly, we provide some advice on how to build the sustainable supply chains, and on the base of which to help a firm to build up its sustainable competitive advantage, in the end of the paper, we take Timberland as a case for further discussion.

AB  - Background Ambient assisted living (AAL) is a common name for various artificial intelligence (AI)—infused applications and platforms that support their users in need in multiple activities, from health to daily living. These systems use different approaches to learn about their users and make automated decisions, known as AI models, for personalizing their services and increasing outcomes. Given the numerous systems developed and deployed for people with different needs, health conditions, and dispositions toward the technology, it is critical to obtain clear and comprehensive insights concerning AI models used, along with their domains, technology, and concerns, to identify promising directions for future work. Objective This study aimed to provide a scoping review of the literature on AI models in AAL. In particular, we analyzed specific AI models used in AАL systems, the target domains of the models, the technology using the models, and the major concerns from the end-user perspective. Our goal was to consolidate research on this topic and inform end users, health care professionals and providers, researchers, and practitioners in developing, deploying, and evaluating future intelligent AAL systems. Methods This study was conducted as a scoping review to identify, analyze, and extract the relevant literature. It used a natural language processing toolkit to retrieve the article corpus for an efficient and comprehensive automated literature search. Relevant articles were then extracted from the corpus and analyzed manually. This review included 5 digital libraries: IEEE, PubMed, Springer, Elsevier, and MDPI. Results We included a total of 108 articles. The annual distribution of relevant articles showed a growing trend for all categories from January 2010 to July 2022. The AI models mainly used unsupervised and semisupervised approaches. The leading models are deep learning, natural language processing, instance-based learning, and clustering. Activity assistance and recognition were the most common target domains of the models. Ambient sensing, mobile technology, and robotic devices mainly implemented the models. Older adults were the primary beneficiaries, followed by patients and frail persons of various ages. Availability was a top beneficiary concern. Conclusions This study presents the analytical evidence of AI models in AAL and their domains, technologies, beneficiaries, and concerns. Future research on intelligent AAL should involve health care professionals and caregivers as designers and users, comply with health-related regulations, improve transparency and privacy, integrate with health care technological infrastructure, explain their decisions to the users, and establish evaluation metrics and design guidelines.

AB  - Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is one of the approaches that provide security and privacy in distributed resource constrained IoT environment with high computational efficiency and less energy consumption. However, the use of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature (ECDSA) for authenticity of IoT users require complex operations in signature generation and verification with high memory consumption. Therefore, we propose a lightweight ECCWatermark scheme that can overcome the ECC-based schemes limitation by using a fragile zero watermarking technique instead of digital signature for authentication. We evaluate the approach with other existing ECC schemes including ECC standard, EC-Schnorr and ECC-Montgomery.

AB  - Electricity access and demand are key issues on the African continent. This poses a real threat to Africa's development and the achievement of the SDG7 goal of ensuring “access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all” until 2030. Solutions lie in the transition to renewable energy. Africa has a considerable and largely untapped potential of renewable energies. Many African countries have realized the urgency and set in place large, government-led projects to achieve a transition to renewable energy. A successful renewable energy transition, however, can only take place with the support of all those involved in the energy sector, starting with the consumer. Hence acknowledging the importance of participatory and decentralized approaches to complement large-scale installations is important. This paper first introduces key challenges of renewable energy in Africa, then suggests Morocco as potential laboratory to test decentralized, participatory, and people-centered approaches to renewable energy, and last but not least develops key recommendations for Africa, drawing on experiences with such approaches in Morocco.

AB  - Extreme weather, natural disasters are increasing, the earth's carrying capacity is limited, and humans continue to survive in the environment of carbon emissions. With the progress of the society, the issue of sustainable development has gradually attracted people's attention. Carbon emissions and renewable energy are important issues for sustainable development and an integral part of sustainable development. This paper uses data from the International Energy Organization and the World Bank to find that developing countries are the mainstay of carbon emissions, and more importantly, carbon emissions have not only negative impacts on the environment or climate change. Maintaining a dynamic balance of carbon emissions will also contribute to the development of the economy and renewable energy.

AB  - Solid waste management (SWM) issues continue to be at the forefront of worldwide environmental policy towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030. Despite the fact that it has been over two and a half years since the original COVID-19 outbreak, the entire world is still suffering from the infectious sickness caused by coronavirus. As a consequence, the garbage generated by families, businesses, and medical institutions has changed in composition. Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves as well as hand sanitizers by frontline workers in medical facilities, banks, shops, the sanitation industry, and other organizations, as well as by the general public, has shifted the waste generation trend in a new direction and presented new challenges. To provide improved health and human security, an effective and long-term sustainable SWM system is required. This study discusses the current status of SWM, identifies the challenges encountered by the SWM sector during the pandemic, as well as the underlying possibilities to eliminate existing system gaps. In the industrial revolution 4.0 era, attaining sustainability in waste management is becoming increasingly realistic, reliable, transparent, efficient, and optimal through the use of IoT, GIS, and ICT. It would further try to make some recommendations of few futuristic Solid Waste Management technologies which might be adapted in Nepal for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of SWM in change circumstances instigated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While providing innovative responses to current waste management constraints, the research also makes several crucial recommendations to policymakers to assist them deal with any future pandemics in a comprehensive manner. This research contributes to the accomplishment of the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as good health, and wellbeing (SDG 3) and Climate Action (SDG 13).

AB  - While China's new energy maintains a rapid development momentum, grid consumption capacity is facing great challenges. In-depth peak regulation of grid peak regulation units represents a powerful measure for raising the new energy consumption level. This paper proposes an automatic control method for grid peak regulation units to improve the consumption level of new energy power generation. In this method, the relationship between new energy consumption and grid power regulation units is constructed. On this basis, considering the new energy consumption and related costs of various factors involved in grid power regulation unit control, the grid peak regulation unit control method and model are established and a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted. The simulation results show that the proposed method can refine the control of the output of grid peak regulation units, effectively increase new energy consumption, and urge the grid toward a high security margin.

AB  - This study explores the evolving landscape of India's transition towards a circular economy, focusing on the significant contribution of prominent corporations. In recent decades, the discernible ecological consequences of corporate activities have catalysed a fundamental change in approach towards sustainable methodologies following governmental aims to attain a state of zero-net emissions. At the core of this paradigm shift lies the notion of the circular economy. This approach prioritises minimising waste and optimising resource efficiency, all within the framework of the fundamental principles of ‘Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.’ Adopting this paradigm can enhance India's resource efficiency, hence promoting long-term sustainability through reevaluating waste materials as valuable resources. This study aims to fully comprehend the shift towards a circular economy, elucidating the activities undertaken by many industries in India and its business executives. Studying the transition towards a circular economy in India is crucial as it addresses the urgent need for sustainable economic practices, helping mitigate environmental degradation and resource scarcity while aligning with global climate goals. Moreover, understanding the role of leading corporations in this transition is essential for shaping effective policies and strategies to drive India's sustainable development agenda.

Utilizing the Research and Development (R&D) methodology, the study progresses through four key stages: problem identification, system design, development, and evaluation. The proposed system incorporates a 3,000 Wp solar panel, a 3,000-Watt controller, a 180 Watt water pump, a 16-inch water filtration unit, and a 45 Watt UV sterilizer. The results indicate that the system can generate 11.25 kWh of electrical energy and produce 7,200 liters of clean water per day, achieving an energy efficiency of 92%. Water quality analysis reveals a Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) level ranging from 215 to 226 ppm and a pH level between 7.92 and 7.95. A cost comparison with conventional systems demonstrates potential annual savings of IDR 492,750 (approximately USD 30.5). This system aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) No. 6 and 7 by enhancing access to clean water and promoting renewable energy utilization. The findings of this study underscore the effectiveness and sustainability of the integrated system in addressing clean water needs in remote areas while advancing the adoption of renewable energy sources.

AB  - Soil erosion is an environmental threat resulting from the combined effects of geo-environmental factors and human activities, affecting the sustainability of land and water resources. This study focused on the climate change impact assessment on soil erosion and sediment yield by adopting RUSLESY (RUSLE-sediment yield) model in Upper Cauvery Sub-basin. The spatio-temporal variations are quantified using data from the global climatic models (GCMs) HadGem3-GC31-LL, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MIROC6, CMCC-ESM2, and BCC-CSM2-MR for the year 2050, for medium (SSP2-4.5) and high emission (SSP58.5) scenarios. Current soil loss and sediment yield rates in Sub-basin are $10,177 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{ha} / \mathrm{yr}$ and $1,842 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{yr}$ respectively. The projected severe soil erosion and sediment yield rates in the Sub-basin in 2050 for the two SSPs are $37,217 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{ha} / \mathbf{y r}$ and $\mathbf{6, 7 3 6} \mathbf{t} / \mathbf{y r}$; $38,253 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{ha} / \mathrm{yr}$ and $6,924 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{yr}$ respectively. The results show an increase in soil erosion rates compared to the current period, with amounts of $27,040 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{ha} / \mathbf{y r}$ and $28,076 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{ha} / \mathrm{yr}$. Sediment yields for two scenarios also will increase, with values of $4,894 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{yr}$ and $5,082 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{yr}$ respectively. Madikeri, Chikkamagaluru, Machalli, and Hassan are identified as areas prone to severe soil erosion. The study’s findings can help policymakers develop appropriate climate mitigation strategies for the impacted community. This study serves as a pilot project in the Western Ghats of Karnataka and can be replicated in comparable geo-environmental settings.

AB  - The drive toward a net-zero economy (NZE) has pressured the manufacturing sector to adopt sustainable practices to minimize negative environmental impacts while ensuring resource efficiency. In this context, polymer-based smart materials have emerged as a promising solution, offering unique properties that respond to external stimuli, enabling more adaptive and efficient manufacturing processes. These materials not only reduce waste and energy consumption but also enhance product lifespans through innovations such as self-healing, recyclability, and degradation control (techniques to manage the breakdown of materials for extended usability and reduced waste). Despite the growing interest, combining polymer-based smart materials into manufacturing processes to achieve sustainability is still underexplored. Limited studies have comprehensively reviewed their potential in supporting sustainable manufacturing, especially in the context of net-zero emissions. This study aims to fill this gap by employing a systematic literature review (SLR) and bibliometric analysis to enhance advancements and challenges in polymer-based smart materials for sustainable manufacturing (SM). This study examines how these materials reduce energy consumption, waste, and environmental impact across various manufacturing sectors through a comprehensive analysis of current advancements, challenges, and industrial applications. The outcomes provide actionable insights for researchers and industry practitioners to accelerate the integration of smart materials into SM processes. This study identifies key factors and future research directions, offering insights for industry practitioners and researchers on the role of these materials in achieving a NZE.

AB  - The liquid-cooling data center (DC) systems have been becoming important for the rapidly developing high-performance processors since the traditional air-cooled DC systems cannot efficiently manage them due to high heat dissipation rates. Two-phase liquid-immersion cooling is one of the promising direct liquid-cooled DC systems, but its system-scale thermal management performance has not been investigated in detail yet. This study performs the system-scale thermal management of a two-phase liquid-immersion cooling DC system under six different real-time and dynamic operation loads in the range of 3.43-9.17 kW to see the thermodynamic and thermoeconomic performances. The system includes the DC server tank, circulation pump, and dry tower. Results show that the best coefficient of performance (COP) and power usage effectiveness (PUE) values are seen at the highest operation load with 6.67 and 1.15 while the minimum COP and the highest PUE are seen at the lowest operation load with 2.5 and 1.4, respectively. In the component-based assessments, the dry tower is found as the most dominant component according to the exergy destruction ratio analysis, energy costing, and carbon-related costs. The exergy efficiency varies between 8.0% and 18.9% for different operation loads, and the operating temperatures have a crucial impact on the exergetic performances. The thermoeconomic analysis deduces that the levelized product cost is roundly 1.14 S$ · h-1 which means the exergy-related terms (e.g. destruction and loss) increase the costing trends 3.25 times as high compared to the traditional energy-based economic calculations.

AB  - The present work introduces a novel yet smart energy system to decarbonize the energy mix, provide cost-effective green energy, and help to achieve sustainable energy production/storage/usage. Smart hydronic units and multiple controllers are the backbone of this idea, which aims to monitor energy conversion among components, the grid, and users through an innovative rule-based framework. This clever integration results in smaller components, bidirectional grid connection, and increased penetration of renewable energy sources into the local energy network. The system is driven by photovoltaic thermal panels and a biomass heater integrated with a heat pump and internal combustion engine. The TRNSYS-MATLAB framework evaluates the system's practicality from all aspects. Multi-objective optimization based on the grey wolf approach equipped with artificial intelligence is added to find the most optimal state. Compared to the conventional system in Norway (hydropower + wind), the proposed smart integration achieves up to 55 % and 5.4 % reduction in energy costs and emission index. In particular, the carbon emission index is lowered to 36.3 g/kWh, and the energy cost is decreased to 38.4 $/MWh. Also, the parametric analysis indicates a conflictive change among key metrics when altering a variable, necessitating the multi-objective optimization to achieve a balancing trade-off. The optimization reduces the emission index, investment cost, and energy cost by about 1.8 g/kWh (5 %), 156,000 $/year (2.5 %), and 1.5 $/MWh (4 %) while improving the efficiency by about 1.7 % compared to the design condition. The suggested system generates 17,830 MW/year of clean energy and can mitigate carbon dioxide emissions by 552,000 kg per year compared to the Norwegian energy mix.

AB  - High-performance computing in the cloud environment uses ample virtual resources, which in turn require physical infrastructures provided by cloud service providers (CSPs). Naturally, CSPs would like to place virtual machines (VM) in a cost-effective way satisfying the resource requirement of the VMs and the capacity constraints of the hosts. Such consideration has led to the well known virtual machine placement (VMP) problem. In this paper, we consider a variant of the VMP, taking into account the communication among the VMs. We introduce the concept of Virtual Cluster, made up of VMs communicating among themselves. It is desirable to place the VMs of a cluster close to each other and thus reduce the communication cost. The objective for the Virtual Cluster Placement (VCP) problem is to reduce the communication cost. For this, we have to consider the network topology of the data center. In this paper, we have proposed some heuristics for both kinds of placement problems (VMP as well as VCP) and given Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations. We have also presented algorithms based on Semidefinite Programming (SDP) and meta-heuristic based on Genetic Algorithms. We have compared the performance of proposed heuristics with other existing works and the optimal solutions obtained from ILPs.

Societies should be envisioned to be more responsive, robust, and consistently strive to support the global economy toward resolving concerns. Besides, as of today, societies are more inclined toward technology adoption. The chapter's purpose is to interpret the role explainable artificial intelligence is playing in modernizing current societies, by attempting to describe the concept of Society 5.0, in conjunction with current Industry 5.0. Explainable artificial intelligence is leading modern societies into digital mobility, digital healthcare, digital finance, and digital government. This will provide information to the wealth of studies that are related to technology and innovation and ways principally explainable artificial intelligence can enable to provide service, efficient utilization, and allocation of resources for achieving smart societies.

AB  - Numerous Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions are available for achieving thermal comfort. They were either trained with limited datasets or using personalized training with limited field studies. This work assessed the model that used the ASHRAE multiple databases as the shallow supervised learning dataset for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based controller suitable for the residential dwellings' node. The learning accuracy can be increased to 96.1%. This paper presented the field studies to show the model performances for the common UK dwellings: the prior 1970s, the new, modular, refurbished, and the use of new materials to improve indoor thermal performance. The result shows that the model was able to perform in different environments and able to acknowledge adaptive human comfort. This was shown by the ability to represent 98.90% of the ASHRAE Standard 55 data, 6.06% improvement from the previous research. As a result, the broader comfort zone acknowledgement can lead to energy saving whilst maintaining comfort by the possibility of lowering the temperature set point. This study also proves that further energy savings can be acquired from the occupants’ presence, scheduling, and activities. These factors can increase the comfort probability to more than 10%.

AB  - Providing an eco-friendly replacement for cement in cementitious materials mitigates not only its consumption but also the environmental effects such as extraction of natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from its production. In light of this, the utilization of rice husk as a by-product of rice fields in the form of rice husk ash (RHA) as a partial substitute for cement, in addition to solving the problem of its disposal due to its silica content and high pozzolanic reaction, has been considered in the construction of sustainable concretes. This study seeks to move from the traditional laboratory-based methods for the examination of compressive strength (fc′) of concretes containing RHA towards artificial intelligence-based techniques by developing a novel hybrid model by integrating biogeography-based optimization (BBO) technique with artificial neural network (ANN). Besides, the performance of the hybrid ANN-BBO model was assessed with the single ANN model. To this end, the models were developed on an extensive dataset including 1276 data records collected from the literature. The efficiency of the models was evaluated by performance criteria and error histogram, and also cross-validation was utilized to avoid overfitting problems and generalize the models. Results demonstrated that the hybrid ANN-BBO model outperformed the single ANN model with high accuracy and minimum error values. Error histograms revealed that over 90 % of errors in the ANN-BBO model occurred in the range (−4 MPa, 4 MPa], while this range for the ANN model fell within (−6 MPa, 6 MPa]. Analyzing the influence of input parameters showed that more than 70 % of the contribution rate in the fc′ of RHA concrete belonged to four influential parameters of specimen age, cement, rice husk ash, and water, respectively. Eventually, to validate the proposed ANN-BBO model, a comparison was made with recent studies, in which the performance criteria revealed that the proposed model based on a more extensive dataset outperformed the models in previous studies.

AB  - As the number of data centers is increasing worldwide, there are concerns about their growing electricity demand on power grids and its impact on the environment. These concerns can be mitigated at the urban scale by utilizing the waste heat generated by data centers and multi-energy hub integration. Using Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) and Photovoltaic (PV) systems within a data center, in combination with district energy network connections, can create energy interactions with residential customers in a multi-energy hub. However, connecting large energy consumers and distributed energy systems to the electrical distribution grid presents challenges due to the conventional design of the power grid with unidirectional electricity flow. There is a lack of understanding about the grid impact of data centers with multi-energy systems regarding electrical performance parameters, energy demand, and emissions. To address these open issues, we developed an hourly energy interaction model that includes a CCHP-PV-based data center and residential customers. In addition, the CCHP-PV-based data center was operated with a cost-optimized energy scheduling. We conducted six case studies to distinguish the specific effects of CCHP, PV, and district energy network connections. The model takes into account hourly outdoor temperatures, energy prices, and varying energy demands to capture the seasonal impact on electrical performance parameters and energy results. From an energy and environmental perspective, CCHP-PV systems can eliminate the data center's electricity demand from the grid, reduce residential energy demand, and decrease carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. This cleaner production and energy exchange further support the United Nations Sustainable Development goals. The experimental results showed a 43% reduction in power loss in the distribution grid and helped the data center's main electrical bus and residential bus against the voltage drop phenomenon. The CCHP-PV-based data center with district heating and cooling connection reduced the peak hour electricity demand on the grid by 39% and annual electricity consumption from the grid by 66%. Furthermore, Greenhouse Gas Protocols (GHG) Scope-2 emissions associated with the data center's grid electricity consumption and only residential electricity consumption were reduced by 77% and 36%, respectively.

AB  - In recent years, the eco-friendly and sustainable nature of biosynthesized nanoparticles has led to increasing interest in their use in a variety of applications. This study examines the use of biomaterials to create nanoparticles that have been shown to improve the efficiency and performance of medical devices such as radiation therapy cancer treatment machines, blood cooling systems, laboratory applications, CT scanners, and MRI machines. The study focuses on the production of the nanoparticles and the assessment of their physical characteristics, such as stability, biocompatibility, and optical and thermal properties. AI-IoT (Artificial Intelligence-Internet of Things) systems can be used to optimize the performance and energy efficiency of solar cooling panel systems. The findings indicate that because of their special characteristics, biosynthesized nanoparticles have a tremendous potential to enhance the efficiency of solar equipment. In this investigation, we investigate the biosynthesis of copper oxide, aluminum oxide, cerium oxide, and graphene oxide nanomaterials for use in solar application equipment. Furthermore, the nanoparticles exhibit enhanced optical and thermal properties, making them ideal for use in solar thermal collectors and photovoltaic cells. The study also demonstrates that the biosynthesized nanoparticles have a high degree of stability and biocompatibility, which makes them suitable for use in medical and biomedical applications. Incorporating graphene oxide nanoparticles into films increased the energy conversion efficiency by 15% compared to films without nanoparticles. The waste nanoparticles can be further used for cancer therapy, medication transport, and other medicinal procedures. Overall, the findings suggest that biosynthesized nanoparticles have the potential to revolutionize the biomedical industry by improving the performance of solar equipment and making it more sustainable and eco-friendlier.

AB  - Spatial layout planning in architecture requires a deep understanding of topological spatial relationships, yet the process remains repetitive and laborious for designers. However, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer new perspectives through automated spatial layout planning (ASLP), diverging from traditional human-centered approaches. This paper employs quantitative and qualitative analyses, reviewing 589 journal articles from the past decade, to gain a comprehensive understanding of ASLP+AI. It also proposes future research directions, exploring image-based, graph-based, performance-based, and agent-based approaches. Contributions to the existing body of knowledge include advancing ASLP through AI methodologies while preserving architects as curators, with a broader impact on academia and industry in promoting AI applications for spatial layout planning.

AB  - The maritime industry is transporting about 90 % of world commerce, contributing to the global greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. Increasing pressure on the sector to reduce its carbon footprint requires developing specialized energy-efficient technologies and studying their compatibility with modern safety and sustainability expectations of the waterborne sector. This research supports the United Nations sustainable development goals SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy) and 13 (Climate Action), and reviews available technologies for shipping decarbonization through design for retrofitting. Promising research areas to improve the energy efficiency of ships could focus on design concepts and methodologies, fluid dynamics, and artificial intelligence. The study suggests that while individual promising decarbonization technologies are available, a comprehensive and coordinated approach is necessary to decarbonize global shipping efficiently. The study identified three promising paths of ship retrofitting to meet the International Maritime Organization decarbonizing objective 2050, aiming at a 70 % reduction of annual greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2008. The first path – using green energy sources (e.g., ammonia, battery, and methanol) – requires scaling up technologies and developing a regulatory framework and control of the lifecycle of the fuel production process. The second path – using ship-based carbon capture technologies, ship design (e.g., hull retrofitting, air lubrication, and wind-assisted propulsion), and operation solutions (e.g., weather routing and logistics planning) – requires building more CO2 storage and control of the lifecycle of liquified CO2. The third path – using biodiesel as a fuel in combination with ship design and operation solutions – requires extending feedstock for biodiesel production.

AB  - The urgency to combat climate change through decarbonization efforts is more crucial than ever. The global building sector is one of the primary contributors to carbon emissions, yet the economic implications of energetic building characteristics of residential buildings remain elusive. This study addresses the intersection of building energy performance, market valuation, and carbon emissions reduction by introducing a novel cluster-based eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodology to uncover the financial impact of energetic building features on property valuation. We combine Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) and property transaction data within the UK and apply two sophisticated machine learning models: XGBoost and CatBoost. To this end, we use hierarchical BIRCH clustering to identify subgroups within our comprehensive dataset and leverage SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and Partial Dependency Plots (PDP) to reveal nuanced insights into the financial contribution of energetic building characteristics to property valuation. This research contributes to the academic discourse by introducing a cluster-based XAI approach for analyzing energy-related financial incentives in the building sector. Our results suggest that energy-efficient building features lead to significant financial benefits outside of London. The cluster-based approach reveals that carbon emissions are predominantly relevant for medium to large buildings outside of London but have a reversed financial effect within the capital. For larger residential buildings, we find a tendency for high running costs for energy (e.g., lighting costs) to be well reflected in transaction prices. The presented findings underscore the potential economic benefits for targeted energy efficiency improvements and illuminate the pathway towards a low-carbon society by addressing inherent uncertainties surrounding the economic viability of energetic investments, thus fostering informed decision-making and sustainable development.

AB  - Variable renewable energy sources (VREs) have experienced steady global growth. The discontinuation of feed-in tariffs (FIT) for new projects in Japan has necessitated the exploration of alternative revenue certainty mechanisms for VREs. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) for supplying carbon-free energy (CFE) have emerged as a promising business model. This study provides a practical framework for integrating diverse flexibilities, encompassing renewable energy curtailment, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and time-shifting demand response (TSDR) for PPAs. To accommodate the unique characteristics of each type of flexibility, the suggested framework consists of sequential optimization problems that incrementally incorporate flexibility to achieve feasible solutions with minimal flexibility. A simulation-based assessment was conducted using a case study involving the provision of the CFE from an onshore wind turbine to a nearby data center. The synergistic relationships between these flexibilities were examined through simulations. The findings highlight that setting a target for BESS's charge state and leveraging the TSDR are key factors in reducing the required capacity of the BESS. For wind developers, this reduction corresponds to a 7.3% decrease in the initial cost. This study offers strategic insights aimed at strengthening the cost advantages of PPAs and enhancing the viability of renewable energy developers and environmentally conscious energy consumers.

AB  - Energy usage in industries is one of the major contributors for climate change, biodiversity loss and resource scarcity. Technological advancements in digitalization led by Industry 4.0 facilitates affordable energy monitoring systems. This allows comprehensive understanding of the primary energy needs and improvement in the areas of inefficiency of a modern manufacturing system. Machine learning has the potential to reveal untapped insights, providing decision support for sustainable manufacturing by improving environmental performances, significant savings, and operational opportunities. The objectives of this research paper are to develop a machine learning algorithm for characterization, and to estimate the energy consumption of various stages in 3D printing. Machine learning model is developed using long short-term memory algorithm, and is trained, validated, and deployed for the classification of various stages during 3D printing process. Furthermore, energy consumption in each stage is estimated based on Simpson’s rule. The characterization of stages is useful for understanding the energy consumption in each stage during the 3D printing process and providing decision support to practitioners in improving the areas of energy and time inefficiencies.

AB  - Biogas is a kind of renewable energy resource and can be burned to produce electricity and heat. If methane is released directly into the air, it would be a very serious source of GHG emissions. Therefore, capturing and recycling methane for power generation would not only significantly reduce industrial greenhouse gas emissions, but also reduce the need to purchase electricity. In addition, with the Net Zero in 2050 initiative and circular economy, more academic and industry research investigate the biogas energy. However, the cost and carbon footprint of biogas energy is varied with the technologies. In this research, the As-Is (biomass waste treatment) and To-Be (biomass waste to energy) model is compared. It shows it is worth to do the investment of bioenergy system for the farm to reduce the GHG emissions if the carbon tax is added. However, the cost of bioenergy facilities will influence the income. A case study is also illustrated to provide the biogas energy production for the government policy.

AB  - Data centers used for internet data services, cloud computing, and/or data storage consume vast amounts of electricity and are increasing rapidly in capacity. Consequently, their power consumption has raised concerns about energy sustainability and environmental impacts. Large-scale, on-site renewable energy could help reduce data centers’ carbon footprint; however, wind and solar power alone cannot provide an uninterrupted power supply to computer servers due to their natural variability. Instead, reliable power integration can be achieved by using fuel cells powered by hydrogen from sustainable resources (e.g., wind and solar energy). Establishing a hydrogen infrastructure will be critical for realizing these benefits and establishing fuel cells as a viable power source for data centers. To facilitate the development of novel carbon-free fuel cell data enters, this paper presents renewable power integrated with hydrogen infrastructures in four scenarios to provide reliable hydrogen supply from production to storage. Various paths were analyzed toward a hydrogen supply infrastructure by determining the proper component sizes and calculating the cost of meeting the server load. We used a microgrid modeling software, Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER), and studied the feasibility of fuel cell powered data centers employing renewable hydrogen. The modeling results show various renewable integration configurations to meet reliable and sustainable power requirement under four scenarios for a carbon-free data center.

AB  - With the development and wide application of WSN (Wireless Sensor Network), the information security becomes a serious problem, especially when the WSN applied in military field. Whereas the general WSN routing protocols focus on the transmission efficiency, reliability and energy-efficiency, not on the security. This paper integrates the international popular AES encryption standard, RSA public-key encryption mechanism and digital signature technology to improve classic AODV routing protocol, and shows an SAODV routing protocol which has both energy efficiency and information security. The theoretical analysis and simulation show: when adding security mechanism to AODV in the routing layer, the system owns the defensive ability for the hidden security problem, such as the eavesdropping, coaxing, imitation, replay, denial of service and HELLO diffusion etc and the normal performance of the network almost conform to the AODV protocol.

AB  - Growing urban population is putting pressure on the supply of natural resources leading to global environmental impacts and calling for new ways to manage urban development. Circular economy strategies can provide the means to both increase resource productivity and generate new business opportunities. Industrial symbiosis is one such strategy. We explore an industrial symbiosis application in this paper. While most previous industrial symbiosis applications have been limited to eco-industrial parks, here we propose an adaptation of the industrial symbiosis and sustainable supply chain management concepts to urban areas in general. It is a way to develop economic clusters incorporating symbiotic links between multiple products supply chains. A proposed iterative facilitated industrial symbiosis method identifies an economic cluster focus, stakeholders, opportunities for resource exchange, and sharing of infrastructure, as well as other important elements. The method provides systematic guidance for practitioners seeking ways to grow local industry and economy, increase resource productivity, reduce wastes, and better utilize local resources. Benefits of industrial symbiosis and barriers to its implementation are also identified in the method. The method comprises five phases, each illustrated on an example drawn from our application of the method in an urban development in Gothenburg, a city in Sweden.

AB  - The article deals with the issue of detecting the presence (absence) of a tendency to improve the energy performance of production facilities in accordance with the requirements of the ISO 50000 series, as well as the moments of inefficient energy consumption process. For this purpose, the control procedure of the energy performance, which provides an analysis of the dynamics of the specific energy consumption and is based on the use of Shewhart charts, is proposed. The limits of regulation of the Shewhart charts are set using the Six Sigma approach. The interpretation of the obtained zones and sub-zones in terms of energy efficiency is proposed. This allows performing a qualitative assessment of the energy performance of the facility. Energy efficiency zones are used as standards for specific energy consumption. Ways to setup alarms about the exceeding the standards that take into consideration the actual energy performance of the controlled facility and the target of its increasing are suggested. The method of comparative analysis of the energy performance of the group of facilities is proposed. For this purpose, the energy efficiency zones of better facility are suggested to use as standard. This approach is applied to control the energy performance of water intakes of the municipal water supply system. The analysis of the results allows performing a qualitative assessment of the energy performance of each water intake and identifying the presence (absence) of tendencies for its improvement (deterioration), including, with taking into consideration the achievements of better water intake. Two steps of the alarms setup for each water intake are proposed in order to inform the energy manager of the control results. The application of the proposed approach provides control over the keeping of the actual energy performance to the established standards, allows determining new targets for its improvement, which contributes to the continuous improvement of energy efficiency of the facility.

AB  - Energy demand forecasting, which is an integral part of energy management has evolved over the past five decades. Of all the energy and economic indicators, used for energy demand forecasting, energy efficiency has emerged as one of the key indicators for current and future scenarios. Energy efficiency becomes even more significant, as it is forecasted to undergo a significant transition in Australia's National Electricity Market. This paper explores, evaluates and establishes the correlation of energy efficiency with total electricity generated, using Pearson's correlation coefficient and econometric toolbox in MATLAB. The parameters such as correlation coefficient (r) and standard error (t-stat) value from the regression analysis are found to be dynamic. The outcome shows that the correlation is transitioning from being strongly negative to strongly positive, indicating a rebound effect of energy efficiency and a correspondingly significant impact on energy management. This could mean potential disruption in the balance of nexus between energy-emissions-economy and thus, energy policymakers can use these results to formulate effective frameworks for accomplishing their ultimate goals of energy security, sustainability and climate change as a whole.

Smart meters play an important role in energy consumption reporting and, thereby, billing. Besides smart meters, the smart grid communication network is composed of heterogeneous devices that are communicating through public networks. Therefore, smart metering communications are susceptible to cyber-attacks and privacy breaches which are still under debating. This paper gives a brief overview of smart grid, smart metering, and the communication networks. Then, the privacy and security requirements of the smart grid network are derived. The various kind of cyber-attacks are discussed, after that, the different schemes and approaches that have been proposed in previous papers are reviewed. Lastly, the open issues on security and privacy of smart grid metering communications are highlighted.

This paper describes modelling methods that shed light on the level of rationality of stakeholders in the Circular Economy (CE). The main aim of the paper is to explore how complex systems, such as mental models of consumers in the CE, can be evaluated with Behavioural system dynamics (BehSD). This is done using a causal loop (CLD) and stock and flow diagrams (SFD). The model builds on the need to improve sustainable activities by better understanding biases. The paper concludes with a simulation using pseudo-random data to showcase that efforts to reduce biases can influence consumer behaviour effectively. It is important to note that rebound effects and policy decisions are significant amongst many other external influences that need further evaluation.

AB  - Building energy management system is required to achieve sustainable energy in the context of global environmental and climate change challenges. Energy consumption prediction is a typical procedure used to manage the energy consumption in buildings. By accurately predicting energy consumption, the effectiveness of various energy-saving measures can be assessed, and corresponding optimization strategies can be developed. This paper presents a machine learning-based energy consumption prediction in buildings. We evaluate nine machine learning models to predict energy consumption. There are 52 features characterizing the dataset, such as the building's energy rating, environmental impact, number of rooms, and lighting descriptions. These features are selected based on their potential relevance to energy consumption, and cover the physical properties of the building, energy usage characteristics and equipment parameters, thus providing the basis for a comprehensive analysis. By performing feature selection using mutual information, we can reduce the number of features into eight, thereby reducing the complexity of the models. The model evaluation is performed using the coefficient of determination, R2 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics. Simulation results show that selecting the features can reduce the complexity of the model while resulting in relatively acceptable performance.

AB  - Design and implementation of a power tax data query tool based on Private Information Retrieval (PIR) technology is presented in this paper, aimed at enabling power companies to securely obtain tax data without revealing the privacy of their queries, thereby more accurately estimating the electricity usage of enterprises. With the development of the digital economy and the instability of economic operations, the tax-electricity index, as a new government tool, is of great significance for monitoring the quality and efficiency of economic operations. By employing Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology, the MASCOT protocol, and PIR technology, this paper designs and implements a method that protects the security of tax-electricity private data while improving data utilization efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the tool can effectively assist power companies in using tax data to optimize enterprise electricity services, providing support for high-quality economic development.

AB  - The high operating costs of Internet Data Centers (IDC) are a major challenge for their owners worldwide. Therefore, more attention has recently been paid to the energy and cost management of IDCs. This paper investigates the optimal operational strategy for minimizing the electricity costs of a group of globally distributed IDCs in different locations under various day-ahead electricity markets, and each is equipped with a high-performance energy storage system. For this goal, optimal workload dispatching and optimal energy management of the storage units of all IDCs are simultaneously perused by the proposed problem. The system is modeled regarding power balancing constraints, battery costs, and quality of service (QoS). For more practical results, a penalty function is also considered when QoS constraints are not perfectly met, and the impact of the batteries’ depth of discharge on the cost of energy storage is also modeled. Moreover, the cross-correlations between the traffic of IDCs are also considered by the multidimensional copula function. The proposed energy cost optimization is linearized for increasing the accuracy of convergence. The results show that not only the power consumption pattern of the IDCs is significantly improved, but also the cost of power consumption is reduced by 34%. The results also prove the positive effect of battery discharge on workload dispatch and represent a compromise between battery costs and electricity cost savings.

AB  - The transition to intermittent renewable energies will necessitate the integration of storage. An interesting technology is the Carnot battery (CB), a novel power-to-heat-to-power system, capable of harnessing waste energy streams. While initial studies have indicated that, under ideal conditions, CB can be competitive with conventional technologies such as chemical batteries, their economic viability in real-world applications remains uncertain. To fill this gap, this work explores the techno-economic potential of electric booster-assisted CB integrated within data centres. Motivation for this case study is the recovery of waste heat, leading to an improved electrical storage efficiency. To maximise the energy self-sufficiency and the internal rate of return, we have applied multi-criteria optimisation to the system design, under three different thermal integration scenarios and for two sets of climatic conditions, using a thermodynamic model and time series from a real data centre. Our analyses suggest that current projections for electricity prices and CB costs yield payback periods exceeding a decade, but that these could fall below ten years if the CB capital costs were halved. Furthermore, it turns out that the choice of optimum charging system (i.e. right balance between heat pump and electrical heater) is contingent on the heat source temperature and availability. For higher temperatures (e.g. 60 °C), heat pumps emerge as the financially most attractive option, thanks to their superior coefficient of performance, whereas for lower temperatures (< 25 °C), resistive heaters are preferable. Results also show that when the aim is to increase the energy self-sufficiency, there exist an efficiency/charging capacity trade-off, which causes a dilemma for the system design. On the one hand, heat pumps are vital to increase the efficiency of the CB, but on the other hand, as the amount of thermal energy available at its source is limited by the data centre operations, electrical boosters are indispensable to increase the charging capacity. To soften this dilemma and enhance the techno-economic performance of thermally integrated CB, future research should explore more efficient booster configurations, such as dual heat source heat pumps.

AB  - Data centers consume a large amount of energy, contributing to CO2 emissions, global warming, and resulting in significant electricity cost. To address these concerns, an increasing number of companies have considered building green data centers. The most abundant energy resource is solar; it is now a key player in the global energy transformation. Tidal energy has also received particular attention recently. The predictable characteristic of the resource makes the kinetic energy of tidal current an extremely competitive power resource compared to other commonly used renewable energies. For this purpose, a hybrid Tidal/Photovoltaic system is used for powering an MW scale green data center on a remote island. Green data centers are mainly dependent on renewable energies, which have intermittent nature and require a storage system capable of ensuring sustainable energy feeding. The proposed system consists of an MW scale proton exchange membrane electrolyzer and fuel cell. This system is associated with the LiFePO4 battery to cover the fast-electrical dynamics. In this paper, the system modeling is presented along with an initial proposal of control and energy management system to align the data center energy consumption with the renewable energy generated while respecting the different system constraints. The model is implemented in Matlab/Simulink platform where the simulation results exhibit the system performance under different operation conditions.

AB  - This study developed an innovative auto-scale transfer learning (ASTL) technology for artificial intelligence (AI) assisted fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). Openly available data on water chiller faults, namely the RP-1043 data set, were used to train the developed ASTL system. The data of water chillers were then transferred to refrigeration systems for FDD. AI-assisted FDD was conducted with an internet of things (IoT) system to complete a case study on 100 refrigeration systems located in 39 different places. The power of these refrigeration systems ranged from 1/4 to 10 hp, and the froze products such as fresh foods, pickled foods, dairy products, and meat products. The practical case studies conducted in this research indicates that energy savings can be achieved by conducting AI-assisted FDD for refrigeration systems. The energy savings for equipment with a power of 1/4–10 hp were 13.43%–26.83%. The application of AI-assisted FDD in refrigeration systems resulted in higher energy conservation than did its application in HVAC systems. In addition, AI-assisted FDD effectively reduced the transportation costs and personnel costs required for equipment maintenance, and the annual cost of the AI platform and the installation cost of the IoT system had the total return of 40.92%.

AB  - Background Clinicians’ scope of responsibilities is being steadily transformed by digital health solutions that operate with or without artificial intelligence (DAI solutions). Most tools developed to foster ethical practices lack rigor and do not concurrently capture the health, social, economic, and environmental issues that such solutions raise. Objective To support clinical leadership in this field, we aimed to develop a comprehensive, valid, and reliable tool that measures the responsibility of DAI solutions by adapting the multidimensional and already validated Responsible Innovation in Health Tool. Methods We conducted a 3-phase mixed methods study. Relying on a scoping review of available tools, phase 1 (concept mapping) led to a preliminary version of the Responsible DAI solutions Assessment Tool. In phase 2, an international 2-round e-Delphi expert panel rated on a 5-level scale the importance, clarity, and appropriateness of the tool’s components. In phase 3, a total of 2 raters independently applied the revised tool to a sample of DAI solutions (n=25), interrater reliability was measured, and final minor changes were made to the tool. Results The mapping process identified a comprehensive set of responsibility premises, screening criteria, and assessment attributes specific to DAI solutions. e-Delphi experts critically assessed these new components and provided comments to increase content validity (n=293), and after round 2, consensus was reached on 85% (22/26) of the items surveyed. Interrater agreement was substantial for a subcriterion and almost perfect for all other criteria and assessment attributes. Conclusions The Responsible DAI solutions Assessment Tool offers a comprehensive, valid, and reliable means of assessing the degree of responsibility of DAI solutions in health. As regulation remains limited, this forward-looking tool has the potential to change practice toward more equitable as well as economically and environmentally sustainable digital health care.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to study whether the social and environmental aspects of firms’ activities may affect effectiveness of Circular Economy by using environmental management accounting (EMA) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of the firms as variables of research. A sample of Indonesian mining and property firms were chosen for the research, and the data used in this research are obtained from the firms’ annual and sustainability report. The results of the research showed that both EMA and CSR had no statistical influence towards the firms’ CE. This result shows that the implementation of EMA and CSR in Indonesian firms is insufficient in bringing out the potentials of Circular Economy and that Indonesian firms may need to increase their sustainability awareness to reach a national sustainable growth.

AB  - We address scheduling independent and precedence constrained parallel tasks on multiple homogeneous processors in a data center with dynamically variable voltage and speed as combinatorial optimization problems. We consider the problem of minimizing schedule length with energy consumption constraint and the problem of minimizing energy consumption with schedule length constraint on multiple processors. Our approach is to use level-by-level scheduling algorithms to deal with precedence constraints. We use a simple system partitioning and processor allocation scheme, which always schedules as many parallel tasks as possible for simultaneous execution. We use two heuristic algorithms for scheduling independent parallel tasks in the same level, i.e., SIMPLE and GREEDY. We adopt a two-level energy/time/power allocation scheme, namely, optimal energy/time allocation among levels of tasks and equal power supply to tasks in the same level. Our approach results in significant performance improvement compared with previous algorithms in scheduling independent and precedence constrained parallel tasks.

AB  - Scientific breakthroughs in recent years have earned widespread recognition. The significance of extenics has become so vital that the discipline is continuously evolving. Additionally, with the deployment of extenics and other innovations, the countries are now more connected and spatially reliant, influencing the global economy. The current study aims to investigate the role of extenics (measured by artificial intelligence (AI)) and spatial factors (measured by geopolitical risk (GPR)) in affecting the natural resources market (NRM). The analysis is performed on the Chinese economy data range from 1985 to 2022. The empirical assessment is carried out by using the unit root tests (Augmented Dickey fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) test), the non-linearity test (BDS test), and the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model. The NARDL results show an asymmetric relationship between AI, GPR, and NRM in both the short run (SR) and long run (LR). A positive (negative) shock to AI, according to the findings, lowers (raises) natural resource rent and hence improves the natural resource market. Similarly, a positive (negative) shock to the GPR increases (decreases) natural resource rent and allows for the exploitation of the natural resource market. The study suggests that in addition to concentrating on extenics applications, the Chinese government needs to strengthen and reform its strategies to regulate spatial impacts to optimize its natural resource market.

AB  - Circular Economy has the goal to reduce value loss and avoid waste by extending the life span of materials and products, including circulating materials or product parts before they become waste. Circular economy models (e.g., circular value networks) are typically complex and networked, involving different cross-industry domains. In the context of a circular value network, multiple actors, such as suppliers, manufacturers, recyclers, and product end-users, may be involved. In addition, there may be various flows of resources, energy, information and value throughout the network. This means that we face the challenge that the data and information from cross-industry domains in a circular economy model are not built on common ground, and as a result are difficult to understand and use for both humans and machines. Using ontologies to represent domain knowledge can enable actors and stakeholders from different industries in the circular economy to communicate using a common language. The knowledge domains involved include circular economy, sustainability, materials, products, manufacturing, and logistics. The objective of this paper is to investigate the landscape of current ontologies for these domains. This will enable us to in the future explore what existing knowledge can be adapted or used to develop ontologies for circular value networks.

AB  - Exploring feasible and renewable alternatives to reduce dependency on traditional fossil-based plastics is critical for sustainable development. These alternatives can be produced from biomass, which may have large uncertainties and variabilities in the feedstock composition and system parameters. This study develops a modeling framework that integrates cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) with a rigorous process model and artificial intelligence (AI) models to conduct uncertainty and variability analyses, which are highly time-consuming to conduct using only the process model. This modeling framework examines polylactic acid (PLA) produced from corn stover in the U.S. An analysis of uncertainty and variability was conducted by performing a Monte Carlo simulation to show the detailed result distributions. Our Monte Carlo simulation results show that the mean life-cycle Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 1 kg PLA is 4.3 kgCO2eq (P5–P95 4.1–4.4) for composting PLA with natural gas combusted for the biorefinery, 3.7 kgCO2eq (P5–P95 3.4–3.9) for incinerating PLA for electricity with natural gas combusted for the biorefinery, and 1.9 kgCO2eq (P5–P95 1.6–2.1) for incinerating PLA for electricity with wood pellets combusted for the biorefinery. Tradeoffs for different environmental impact categories were identified. Based on feedstock composition variations, two AI models were trained: random forest and artificial neural networks. Both AI models demonstrated high prediction accuracy; however, the random forest performed slightly better.

AB  - This study adopts the computational fluid dynamics software−ANSYS FLUENT to predict the airflow and temperature distribution in a next-generation overhead downward flow (ODF)-type data center (DC). The study's primary objective is to minimize the entropy generation rate of the heat exchanger (HX) used in the ODF system in order to achieve energy savings. The ANSYS DesignXplorer optimization tool is employed to find the optimal design point with the smallest entropy generation rate of the HX. The predicted total exergy destruction of the DC at the optimal design point shows that the proposed A1-grade DC defined by ASHRAE TC 9.9 can save energy effectively. Moreover, the predicted power usage effectiveness (PUE) is lower than the average PUE reported in 2020 and all of the thermal performance metrics fall within the range of ideal conditions. The numerical results show that two approaches can effectively save energy in the ODF-type DC: one is to suitably increase the air-supply temperature; and the other is to suitably increase the temperature difference between the air-supply and return ports. Moreover, the separation of cold and hot aisles can effectively avoid the mixing of cold and hot airflows, resulting in an insignificant exergy destruction in the airspace.

AB  - The availability of water is very influential on human life and the economic growth of a country. However, there are still a lot of cases where human rights and their needs for water have not been met. The aim of this study provides empirical evidence and increasing awareness regarding the use and management of water and wastewater in Car Wash companies in Indonesia in which, also provide an idea about the circular water management process that can be carried out by Car Wash companies. The idea about circular water management in car wash companies can improve cost-efficiency. The object of this study is a car wash company in Jakarta. Based on the qualitative approach, this study more interpretive in nature. This study uses primary data that was obtained through interviews with the owner and the car wash workers, field observations, documenting literature review and secondary data that obtained was through financial reports in 2019-2021. Interviews were conducted by providing open-ended questions related to the use and management of water and wastewater associated with Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Restore, Recover (5R). The results of this study indicate that Car Wash companies in Indonesia have not used Circular Water Management and have not even carried out water management at all. The unmanaged of used water and wastewater results in a lack of clean water availability and worsens water quality in the area around the company. This study is expected to be a reference for further study as studies on Circular Water Management in Car Wash Companies have not yet exist, especially in Indonesia. This study raises the concept of a circular economy in the water sector at a Car Wash company which is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals No. 6 due to the fact that there are no known previous studies that has raised the concept of the circular economy related to water management in Car Wash companies, especially in Indonesia.

AB  - China's economy is changing from high-speed growth to high-quality development. Now its development is green and sustainable, characterized by low energy consumption and high innovation. Under the circumstance, it is vital to research on the threshold effects of energy consumption, technological innovation, and supply chain management on enterprise performance in China's manufacturing industry. This study selects data from 115 manufacturing companies listed in the Stock Exchange of Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2019 as samples. We adopt the panel threshold model to analyze the impact of energy consumption, technological innovation, and supply chain management on enterprise performance. Our results show that energy consumption, technology innovation and supply chain management all have non-linear relationship on enterprise performance. There is an inverse S-shaped relationship between energy consumption and enterprise performance, and a significant threshold effect of technology innovation. Moreover, technological innovation has a two-sided effect on enterprise performance. In addition, supply chain management has a significant positive impact on enterprise performance. According to the project of China's carbon peaking by 2030, we put forward some methods for energy conservation, emission reduction, cost saving, and efficiency improvement for China's manufacturing industry. We also provide some suggestions for enhancing enterprises' technological innovation and supply chain management.

AB  - Modern industrial and data center networks adopt multipath TCP (MPTCP) to achieve low communication latency. To make full use of multiple paths, MPTCP divides one TCP connection into multiple subflows. Due to the connection-level ACK blocking, however, MPTCP suffers from the traffic burstiness, which leads to large queueing delay, frequent packet drops, and even TCP timeout. To mitigate the traffic burstiness caused by ACK blocking, we propose MPTCP-RB (Multipath TCP with Reduced Burstiness), which interleaves consecutive packets across multiple subflows, instead of assigning consecutive packets to individual subflows. MPTCP-RB is implemented as a loadable Linux kernel module, working on any traditional MPTCP-based schemes without any other modifications on existing network stacks. The testbed and NS2 experiments show that, MPTCP-RB reduces the average flow completion time by up to 91% compared with the state-of-the-art MPTCP-based schemes.

AB  - In the context of increasingly frequent extreme weather events, exploring the role of financial technology (FT) and aluminum (AL) in reducing carbon emissions (CE) is of great significance to promote the low-carbon economy transformation. Based on the TVP-SV-VAR model, this paper attempts to evaluate the ability of FT and AL on mitigating climate change and lowering carbon footprints. The outcomes confirm that AL and FT play an essential role in inhibiting short- and long-term CE, respectively. Specifically, the widespread use of AL in zero-carbon buildings, automotive lightweight and renewable energy technologies highlight its effectiveness in decreasing energy consumption and enhancing environmental quality. Besides, the development of FT reduces unnecessary resource consumption and CE by simplifying payment methods and improving financial service efficiency. Moreover, the indirect effects of FT on CE are examined by considering the role of renewable energy (RE). The results show that FT has both positive and negative effects on CE. The positive impact means that FT can stimulate investors to increase investment in the RE industry and reduce carbon pollution. Against the background of promoting the goal of carbon neutrality, this paper can provide useful insights for policymakers to formulate effective carbon reduction policies.

AB  - The use of phase change materials (PCMs) to store energy in solar systems can be very useful to augment their efficiency. This paper presents a numerical study on the effect of using PCM in a thermal solar panel system. Four tubes containing alumina/water nanofluids (NFs) flow are used in this system, and NFs flow is analyzed. A spiral blade is employed on the tubes. By changing the pitch distance (d-P) of the spiral blade, the variations of the molten PCM (MPCM) and the temperature of different components of the solar system are determined transiently for 25 min. The numerical study is carried out using the FEM. The results demonstrate that the outlet temperature (T-O) is enhanced from 293 K at time 0 s to a temperature of more than 327 K at 1500s. The value of the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) reaches a value of more than 44 W/m2K up to 25 min. The value of the HTC is lower most of the time for a d-P of 20 mm than other distances. Changing the d-P from 20 to 30 mm can vary the T-O by 0.5 degrees. The minimum of MPCM corresponds to a d-P of 20 mm.

AB  - The rise of cloud gaming makes interactive 3D applications an emerging type of data center workload. However, the excessive rendering in current cloud 3D systems leads to large gaps between the cloud and client frame rates (FPS, frames per second), thus wasting resources and power. Although FPS regulation can remove excessive rendering, due to the highly-varying frame processing time and the use of rendering delays, existing cloud FPS regulation solutions have low FPS and slow motion-to-photon (MtP) latency, causing violations of Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.In this paper, we present a novel cloud FPS regulation solution, called OnDemand Rendering (ODR). ODR employs multi-buffering, dynamic rendering delay/acceleration, and input processing prioritization to reduce excessive rendering and ensure QoS satisfaction. ODR was evaluated in our private cloud and Google cloud. Evaluation results showed that ODR effectively removed excessive rendering, thus improving DRAM performance by 19% and reducing power usage by 16% over no FPS regulation. Better memory efficiency also allowed ODR to increase client FPS by 5.5%. Moreover, ODR reduced average MtP latency by more than 92% and outperformed existing FPS regulations. More importantly, ODR's high FPS and low latency make it feasible to deploy 3D applications to conventional public clouds.

AB  - The Fourth Industrial Revolution with a global demand for digital product life-cycle and the digital economy. The pervasiveness of internet of things, sensors, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and particularly digital manufacturing and digital supply chain management led to the formation and development of the digital economy. A digital device alters from an auxiliary tool to an essential production element when the cost of production is low and the needs for inventory is minimized, so that it can be used for different financial levels. In fact, the development of digital production systems and supply chain will not only affect how the supply chain is managed, but also will define the concurrency of the production with the other activities in product life-cycle. In this paper, the role of Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MEAM) on Digital Production Systems and supply chain management is investigated. It is discussed how MEAM is comparable to the other metal 3D printing methods, in terms of machine cost, printing and post-processing. In addition, it is discussed that considering overall mechanical properties of the final products, production requirement, and cost what can be expected as the role of MEAM in digital production’s economy.

AB  - Amine-based absorption/desorption systems are a well-established method for CO2 capture process due to their fast absorption rates, high CO2 loading, and recyclability. However, the significant drawback is the high energy required for solvent regeneration and heavily water evaporation significantly limits their efficiency. To overcome this, non-aqueous CO2 absorbents have been developed as an alternative, offering advantages such as thermal stability, high absorption capacity, and reduced energy consumption compared to traditional aqueous amine systems. Consequently, research focuses on developing cost-effective, efficient, and sustainable non-aqueous absorbents. This review summarizes findings from 2011 to 2024 on CO2 capture which employing non-aqueous absorbents, including absorption performance, mechanisms, energy consumption, and challenges. The first section examines amine-based non-aqueous solutions, encompassing single and blended amine absorbents. The second section explores CO2 binding liquids, and phase-changed amine absorbents. Energy consumption and operational cost comparisons among non-aqueous absorbents in different systems were conducted due to its critical importance. In conclusion, this review highlights the advantages, challenges, and potential of non-aqueous absorbents in CO2 capture. Addressing energy consumption issues and pursuing sustainable alternatives contribute to progress in carbon capture for mitigating climate change. Future research should prioritize optimizing non-aqueous systems to balance energy savings, cost-effectiveness, and scalability to combat climate change effectively.

AB  - Wireless sensors networks (WSN) are getting a special place in the development of e-Health application, due to its characteristics such as: not intrusive design, low energy consumption, low price and its flexibility to integrate into health care environments. However, the use of WSN in these kind of environments must consider those security and privacy mechanisms required by applicable personal data protection legislations to provide end-to-end guarantees to the patient's information. Applications and research projects are taking place to offer e-Health solutions with these features, however still there is not framework or standard to support interoperability among these or to provide a design criteria for future developments. Towards this goal, in this paper we survey a set of e-Health proposals for WSN, focusing on the mechanisms used to provide security and privacy to support real-time and multimedia data transmission in WSN.

AB  - Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to sea level rise due to the climate change. Soil salinity is one of the potential threat to the coastal ecosystem and agriculture which might hinder the country's future food security. Conventional field-based soil salinity monitoring over vast region may not be cost and time efficient. Satellite remote sensing is offering an efficient way to monitor soil salinity via different indices. This study monitors soil salinity in five years interval from 1990 to 2015 using a regression equation which is developed and tested in the same geographical area to calculate soil salinity from Landsat images. The result shows that soil salinity increases significantly in most of the part of the study area in 25 years period. The percentage of very high saline soil is increased from less than 1% in 1990 to 33% in 2015 which is very alarming for the agriculture growth in this area.

AB  - Regarding the current circumstances, climate change and environmental problems affect most countries globally, some more than others. Adapting to climate change impacts is not only an issue of the future cities but a worrying situation of the present. For most local governments of water sensitive cities in the Middle East, adapting to extreme weather events and mitigating climate change are important issues. Moreover, ancient cities in the Middle East, like Qazvin, are outstanding samples of flood adaptation and mitigation that are still in use. This paper demonstrates how well the ancient blue-green infrastructure in Qazvin provides a base for taking advantage of floods and how the system can adapt to future climate change. Therefore, the results present how ancient blue-green infrastructure can manage flash floods and how they can be seen as a context for smart flood management. During flash floods, the blue-green infrastructure collects floodwater as well as distribute it at the same time. Thus, the system not only can mitigate the adverse effects of seasonal floods but also adapt to climate change through drought conditions. The blue-green infrastructure in Qazvin is an excellent example of ancient science implemented to mitigate climate change. The research method is evidence-based and case-specific. This paper presents a practical integrated solution as a base for smart water management. Exploring ancient science and implementing our ancestors’ ideas and techniques can pave our way toward future smart and sustainable cities and give us more effective solutions to smart flood management.

AB  - Energy security is one of the key priorities of the United Nations' sustainable development agenda of 2030. Limited studies have focused on accessibility, availability, and security of energy across the provinces of Vietnam using household data. The present study considers aims to fill this gap and by quantifying the level of electricity and cooking fuel consumption in Vietnam at the household level. The results of our analysis reveal that the rate and consumption of electricity as well as heating and cooking fuel use are significantly different across the geographical regions of Vietnam. Particularly, the Red River and Mekong River deltas have very high consumption of electricity. Following the same pattern, access to heating and cooking fuel is distributed mainly northern region near Hanoi and the southern region near Ho Chi Min City. These regions of River deltas have fertile plain land and high intensity of livelihood engagement, which accelerates the use of energy resources. The outcome is an integrated method for quantification of energy security initiatives that can be instigated on a number of spatial and institutional levels. This method can provide insights into the state of energy security in Vietnam, and can become an important tool in simultaneously evaluating energy development priorities worldwide.

AB  - Circular economy (CE) and sustainability are interrelated, without being exchangeable. While sustainability tries to reconcile the management of productive resources with their increasing consumption, CE aims to make the productive process more efficient, reducing, reusing and recycling the results of the productive process as much as possible. The aim of this paper is to find out the systemic structure of interactions between sustainability and CE, through the analysis of the existing literature from 2004 to 2021. For this purpose, a computational literature review and content analysis method of CE strategies and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the existing scientific literature has been conducted. It shows that there is a positive impact of the synergy between CE strategies and certain SDGs. All this has led to inclusion in the formulation of policies and strategies, although there is still potential to legislate an even more sustainable framework.

AB  - In smart grids, a major challenge is how to effectively utilize consumers’ energy consumption data while preserving security and privacy. In this article, we tackle this challenging issue and focus on energy theft detection, which is very important for smart grids. Specifically, we note that most existing energy theft detection schemes are centralized, which may be unscalable, and more importantly, may be very difficult to protect data privacy. To address this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection, namely, FedDetect. In our framework, we consider a federated learning system that consists of a data center (DC), a control center (CC), and multiple detection stations. In this system, each detection station (DTS) can only observe data from local consumers, which can use a local differential privacy (LDP) scheme to process their data to preserve privacy. To facilitate the training of the model, we design a secure protocol so that detection stations can send encrypted training parameters to the CC and the DC, which then use homomorphic encryption to calculate the aggregated parameters and return updated model parameters to detection stations. In our study, we prove the security of the proposed protocol with solid security analysis. To detect energy theft, we design a deep learning model based on the state-of-the-art temporal convolutional network (TCN). Finally, we conduct extensive data-driven experiments using a real-energy consumption data set. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed federated learning framework can achieve high accuracy of detection with a smaller computation overhead.

AB  - Successive approximation register (SAR) analog to digital converters (ADCs) are used in many edge Internet of Things (IoT) devices to digitize analog inputs before further processing. These inputs can be private, requiring physical side-channel security to protect the data being converted. Previous works (Jeong et al., 2021), (Miki et al., 2020) have found vulnerabilities in the power side channels of SAR ADCs and proposed limited fixes. Whereas power side-channel attacks (SCAs) require cutting the power trace and introducing a shunt resistor for measurement, electromagnetic (EM) SCAs are possible to perform noninvasively external to packaging. In this work, we present a randomized switching SAR (RS-SAR) ADC protection that is effective against both power and EM SCAs, reducing the attack efficacy by $32\times $ for EM attacks and $82\times $ for power attacks.

AB  - In recent years, the transition towards a more sustainable energy system has become the center of the global community focus. This paper examines the current energy situation in Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county in Northern Hungary. The Gini index is calculated on residential gas and electricity consumption for the sixteen districts in the county. Furthermore, energy consumption trends are analyzed, and the differences based on income are highlighted. Results indicate that although the county’s population has declined through the past years, the electricity consumption trend is slightly inclining. In contrast, gas consumption patterns are declining. Gini index results indicated that energy inequality has varied throughout the years. Districts with high industrial activities show more energy consumption and income than poorer districts, where the consumption varies between low and high. To facilitate energy transition in the region, further analysis is needed to understand better energy poverty and the possible local renewable energy resources.

AB  - The 2020 Solarwinds attack was a tipping point that caused a heightened awareness about the security of the software supply chain and in particular the large amount of trust placed in build systems. Reproducible Builds (R-Bs) provide a strong foundation to build defenses for arbitrary attacks against build systems by ensuring that given the same source code, build environment, and build instructions, bitwise-identical artifacts are created. Unfortunately, much of the software industry believes R-Bs are too far out of reach for most projects. The goal of this paper is to help identify a path for R-Bs to become a commonplace property.To this end, we conducted a series of 24 semi-structured expert interviews with participants from the Reproducible-Builds.org project, finding that self-effective work by highly motivated developers and collaborative communication with upstream projects are key contributors to R-Bs. We identified a range of motivations that can encourage open source developers to strive for R-Bs, including indicators of quality, security benefits, and more efficient caching of artifacts. We also identify experiences that help and hinder adoption, which often revolves around communication with upstream projects. We conclude with recommendations on how to better integrate R-Bs with the efforts of the open source and free software community.

AB  - Although the use of mobile technology in Indian agriculture has been the subject of an expanding corpus of research, little is known about how farmers perceive the potential of these technologies to improve agricultural sustainability. In light of this observation, and given the low adoption rates of agricultural mobile apps in India, this study seeks to gain a deeper understanding of farmers' perceptions of how this app helps to improve agricultural sustainability. In-depth interviews were used to collect data from 20 farmers, and 4 major themes were derived from the content analysis of the interview data. The findings of this study indicate that the majority of respondents (94%) perceived that the Kisan Suvidha App has the potential to improve agricultural sustainability. In their opinion, this app is very instrumental in promoting agricultural sustainability due to its ability to facilitate the effective exchange of agricultural information between extension service providers and farmers and link farmers with markets and other actors in the food value chains.

AB  - In today's modern digital and competitive world effective and secure supply chain plays a vital role for different suppliers. Most of consumers buy products from online platforms. So, the supply chain becomes extremely important. The success of every business depends on revenue generated from effective supply chain management strategies. Nowadays, consumers are aware, sensitive and concerned about the quality, security, integrity, transparency, traceability and time is also very important for all of them. It is too difficult to retain and maintain consumer trust. Security is the prime concern in any supply chain. There are so many factors that affect the data security and integrity while the product is in chain. There are number of intermediaries who participate in a supply chain. Many unauthorized users may also try to intrude a supply chain. A number of threats like Ransomware attacks, MITM attacks, stolen certificates etc. are possible that may affect smooth processing of supply chain. To avoid these threats proper management of supply chain is mandatory. Authentication and integrity of the product should be maintained. By the use of techniques like block chain, cryptography, smart contracts and digital certificates a good level of security can be achieved. In this paper a state of the art to preserve security in terms of authentication and integrity is discussed. Some of the major security threats and their proposed solutions and future directions are also discussed.

AB  - The selection of appropriate electricity generation strategies is crucial in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting a low-carbon economy. Assessing the effectiveness of clean energy technologies and external support in Ghana’s climate change mitigation is crucial for sustainable development. This study focuses on Ghana’s commitment to emission reduction goals outlined in the country’s Energy Transition Framework, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and the Fourth National Communication (NC4) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These goals recognize the significance of external assistance in achieving a conditional 30% reduction target, along with an unconditional 15% reduction strategy. By utilizing the IAEA MESSAGE model, a comprehensive quantitative analysis is conducted to assess the effectiveness of additional installed capacity of clean energy technologies, mainly renewables and nuclear energy, in mitigating climate change, considering the role of external support. The results highlight the need for a transition from fossil fuel-based sources to low-carbon alternatives such as renewables and nuclear energy to meet emission reduction targets and promote sustainable development. Also, despite the higher investment cost associated with the additional installed capacity, the mitigation measures deployed in the electricity system reduced CO2 emissions by 15% (4,142.2 kilotons). Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of additional clean energy capacity to meet the growing electricity demand, facilitated by external aid. The findings provide valuable insights into best practices and strategies for achieving sustainable development goals in Ghana and can inform policy decisions and support sustainable energy development in other developing countries.

AB  - For many years, women have been leading the way in sustainability, bringing about change and building a more sustainable world for future generations. Women have played a crucial role in promoting economic parity, social justice, and environmental conservation, from grassroots movements to corporate boardrooms. Despite this, women are still underrepresented in positions of leadership in sustainability. According to a 2019 UNEP research, women hold only 10% of board positions in the oil and gas business and only 30% of senior management positions in the renewable energy sector. Women continue to contribute significantly to leadership in sustainability despite these obstacles. They bring distinctive viewpoints, abilities, and experiences to the table, and their leadership is essential to address some of the most urgent sustainability concerns facing the world, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social injustice. Our research study investigates the role of women in sustainable leadership, the problems they encounter, and the techniques that may be used to support and develop their leadership.

AB  - This article addresses the UN Millennium Declaration, which seeks to reduce poverty and promote human dignity, equality, peace, democracy, and sustainability. Global development began with the Millennium Development Goals. The Millennium Development targets (MDGs) fulfilled these promises by identifying eight interrelated targets that the world could attain by 2015.The 2030 Agenda's global objectives link sustainability's three most fundamental elements-natural, social, and economic. Bahrain struggles to keep up with its fast-growing population due to its tiny area and limited resources. The Kingdom's GDP was BD 12,245 million (USD 32.5 billion) in 2017, impacted by Arab and Gulf turmoil since 2011. This uncertainty has affected the Kingdom's oil-and-gas-based economy, which has a 65% export-to-import ratio. The research finds that Bahrain must address population growth, urbanization, and land shortages. Population expansion, infrastructural development, and climate change threaten Bahrain's rich and varied maritime environments. These risks affect the economy, society, and environment greatly. Incubators speak about four success phases. Lower-range incubators don't consider environmental management. Second-category incubators sell environmental management heavily. According to their data, incubators that apply environmental management practices are in the third quartile and those with excellent standards are in the fourth.

AB  - Recent advancements in cyber-physical systems have significantly increased the vulnerability of water distribution systems to cyber attacks, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study evaluates a decentralized detection model, leveraging edge computing to enhance the timeliness and efficiency of anomaly detection while minimizing energy consumption and carbon emissions. Despite a slight 0.4% decrease in overall performance compared to centralized systems, the decentralized model showed a 0.015% improvement in the mean time to detection, outperforming both the centralized benchmark and existing literature values. The reduction of energy consumption and emissions during training are estimated with approximately 75%, while in inference the estimate of emission reductions spans two orders of magnitude. Moreover, we demonstrate a significant advancement in attack localization, successfully assigning detected anomalies to three specific edge areas of the network. Our approach not only addresses the immediate challenges of cybersecurity in water distribution systems but also contributes to the broader goal of sustainable and resilient infrastructure.

AB  - In an industrial context, different industries today face several constraints in managing their supply chains, especially after the COVID-19 crisis, which has given rise to a new generation of industry known as "Industry 5.0." This new era introduces several concepts and aspects within each supply chain that focus on key factors such as sustainability, resilience, and, most importantly, the centric human. Our study is based in a framework that aims to integrate sustainability into supply chain management to establish a sustainable approach to supply chain management. This framework is based on three dimensions aligned with the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) perspective, namely "Knowing," "Doing," and "Being." Subsequently, we apply qualitative and exploratory research through an extensive literature review. Using the "Doing" and "Being" dimensions, we then develop a framework that represents a model for sustainable supply chain management while proposing the managerial and theoretical implications to consider. Furthermore, through this work, we provide new insights for future studies to apply this framework in two automotive industry companies.

AB  - The study explores the link between agricultural value added and environmental expenditures to provincial governments' revenues. Due to data scarcity, this study investigates datasets pertaining to provinces from 2016 to 2020 in Indonesia. An instrumental variables 2SLS and OLS estimators ware employed to evaluate the datasets. The results of the study indicate that agricultural value added per person in the Indonesian agriculture sector do not contribute to the local government revenues. However, the study found that environmental spendings allocated by the local government contribute to higher revenues. From this perspective, there is urgency to modernize the agriculture-related sector with environmental expenditures so that it will contribute more to the local government revenues, thereby advancing the city's economic and social development goals. By this finding, the governments are encouraged to seek strategies to prevent the squandering of agricultural-related sectors, enabling them to contribute to the country's long-term SDGs goals.

AB  - The study investigates the integration of Circular Economy (CE) principles into higher education institutions (HEIs) in the UAE to address the growing challenges of waste management and sustainability. The UAE's economic growth and population increase have led to significant waste generation, necessitating a transition from the traditional linear economy model to a sustainable CE framework. Despite HEIs’ critical role in promoting sustainable development goals, existing accreditation standards lack requirements for CE implementation. Through a qualitative survey of 43 participants from 45 HEIs in UAE, the presented work examines awareness levels among HEIs employees, existing waste management practices in HEIS, and challenges to CE adoption within HEIs. The preliminary findings reveal a gap in providing formal training on CE and sustainability to HEIs employees, limited awareness of CE concepts within the employees, and inconsistent implementation of waste management practices in HEIs. The study proposes the need for a new CE framework designed for HEIs, focusing on: Awareness and Knowledge, Institutional Policies and Governance, and Infrastructure and Operations, to align with the UAE's 2021-2031 Circular Economy Policy.

AB  - Context: India’s coal use for electricity jumped 13% in 2021–22. Energy management systems (EnMS) are seen as a solution, but only sustainable EnMS can have a discernable impact on the carbon footprint and the Return On Investment (ROI). Objective: Designing a software-intensive sustainable energy management system requires considering technical, environmental, social, and economic factors. This helps evaluate an EnMS’s overall impact and improve its design. We proposed EnSAF for efficient utilization of the energy incurred for the design of sustainability-aware EnMSs. Method: In this work, EnMSs in diverse use cases were selected and analyzed in terms of technical, social, environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainability in collaboration with various stakeholders. The set of application-specific design concerns and Quality Attributes (QAs) were addressed by the Sustainability Assessment Framework (SAF) toolkit. The resultant SAF instances of each EnMS, derived through the analysis and discussion with the stakeholders, were then analyzed to advocate the DMs and SQ model for generic EnMSs. Results: This study demonstrated the following outcomes (i) technical concerns dominate the existing EnMSs (ii) integration of renewable energy resources reduces dependency to the main power grid and nurtures a sustainable environment by diminishing carbon footprint, and minimizing payback time, in the economic dimension; (iii) extant definitions of quality attributes need significant scrutiny and updates apropos of objectives of EnMSs Conclusion: The SAF toolkit was found to be deficient in the representation of relevant design concerns and quality attributes concomitant with sustainable EnMS. Prevailing DMs are inept to factor in stakeholder’s concerns, as the model is ill-equipped to account for spatio-temporal representation of QAs. Pursuant to the insights from the 4 SAF instances, a generic framework, EnSAF, is proposed to tackle the relevant concerns apropos of EnMS sustainability. This work proposed a representation of DMs in the SAF toolkit specifically for sustainability-aware EnMS.

AB  - This study presents a pioneering approach in building energy forecasting by introducing a novel reformulation framework that transforms the forecasting task into an image inpainting problem. Based upon the fundamental notion that “forecasting is about generating data of the future”, we propose BEForeGAN, an innovative deep generative approach for day-ahead Building HVAC Energy consumption Forecasting based on multi-channel conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with U-Net generators. Our method is evaluated using 96,360 hourly HVAC energy consumption records from 11 buildings, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements of 17%∼76% and a substantial variability reduction of 3%∼96% compared to a suite of conventional and deep learning benchmark models across individual-building and zero-shot cross-building forecasting tasks. Notably, BEForeGAN exhibits robustness to noisy inputs, with an increase below 3% in Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Square Error (CV-RMSE) for each 10% noise increment. This study addresses critical gaps in existing literature by showcasing the untapped potential of GANs as standalone forecasters, advocating for further exploration of two-dimensional (2D) GAN-based methods in building energy forecasting, and emphasising the need for more studies focusing on cross-building forecasting tasks. In conclusion, our findings underscore the transformative impact of GANs in revolutionising building energy forecasting practices, paving the way for enhanced energy-efficient building management and beyond.

AB  - CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) has been a mature and promising technology since the 1970s, offering a dual solution for energy production and carbon sequestration. Recent advances in reduced-order models (ROMs) using empirical analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools handle complex data efficiently. However, existing ROMs for CO2-EOR often lack validation due to data confidentiality or are too case-specific for broader application. This paper introduces a framework to close these gaps, enabling the development and consistent comparison of generalized ROMs for CO2-EOR with carbon capture and storage (CCS), even with traditional tools. A synthesis dataset (∼3000 runs) was established to develop ROMs, which were validated using field data from both EOR and CCS perspectives. Three key findings are revealed. First, normalizing outputs with respect to CO2 utilization illustrated a direct relationship between CCS and EOR. Second, generalized statistics-based ROMs reduced input complexity and validated field data but predicted fewer outputs. Machine learning-based ROMs predicted more outputs, supporting field operational decision-makings. Last, ROMs were particularly suitable for early-stage, large-scale CO2-EOR assessments. This study extended the boundaries of developing generalized ROMs for CO2-EOR and identified pros and cons across modeling approaches, contributing to net-zero goals and advancing sustainable and affordable energy future.

AB  - Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) can be applied to monitor a variety of mineral and chemical processes including: velocity measurements in drilling cuttings and hydrocyclone operations. Hydraulic conveying systems rely upon the knowledge of slurry density to ensure efficient transportation of the solids. Typically, density measurements exploit the attenuation of gamma ray photons which poses complex safety, operational and regulatory concerns with Electrical Impedance Tomography affording a non-nuclear alternative to traditional approaches. To optimise the accuracy of this non-nuclear density measurement, the electrical conductivity of the aqueous phase in a multi-component slurry, is required. Whilst conductivity probes are sufficiently accurate, there are often drawbacks and limitations due to installation restrictions, as it is difficult to separate aqueous and solid phases in real-time. Electrical Impedance Fingerprinting (EIF), is a novel measurement technique which characterises formulation properties, in-situ, based upon electrical impedance sensing and artificial intelligence algorithms. This paper outlines the development of EIF and its application to monitor aqueous phase conductivity in multi-component slurries, containing sands and clays. EIF accurately predicts this conductivity with high accuracy and a root-mean squared error of 0.055 mS cm−1. This development ensures accurate non-nuclear density measurements (<5%) are obtained across an extended aqueous electrical conductivity range of 1.5–70 mS cm−1. This encompasses the majority of target hydraulic conveying systems in mining operations. EIF also enhances the functionality of ‘traditional’ electrical tomography as not only are mineral processes able to be visualised, but the process materials are simultaneously characterised, to improve process understanding, optimisation and control.

AB  - Hybrid Energy Systems (HES) combine multiple energy sources to maximize energy efficiency. Due to the unpredictability and dependence on the weather, integrating renewable energy sources (RES) is a viable option for distributed distribution (DG). To minimize environmental impact and meet the increasing energy demand–supply gap, scientists need to find alternative energy sources. Several studies have confirmed that HES is economically viable in remote areas, particularly in off-grid applications. Despite several improvements over the past few years, existing HES control systems are complex, costly, less reliable, and not sufficiently efficient. The purpose of this paper is to present the most common challenges faced by stand-alone hybrid energy systems and how the artificial intelligence (AI) technique has improved them. AI techniques are widely used in HES, and this study addressed how AI can solve classification, forecasting, networking, optimization, and control problems. This study provides an overview of the recent history of HES critical challenges in energy management, sizing, demand side management, and storage management; additionally, we have addressed several conceptual/theoretical problems, antecedents, and consequences that may be of interest or require further research. Companies must ensure their systems perform effectively and pay for their investments. Regardless of the system, failures and defects should be diagnosed and repaired as soon as possible. This can be achieved by increasing the system’s efficiency and preventing early-stage damage. Researchers and project managers who work on hybrid systems will find this paper to be an invaluable resource.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence powered application have become the norms in day-to-day life. This has a tremendous role for material investigations catering diverse applications. Present day advanced materials as various MAX phases transformed into MXenes have immense applications for environmental use. MXenes have shown great potential in photocatalysis application targetingCO2 reduction, H2O2 production, wastewater and dye treatment and nitrogen fixation. For an AI based implementation and model development, the basics of photon capture and charge transfer characteristics of photocatalytic materials, right from biological systems to organic/inorganic solar cells are crucial. This had been very thoroughly worked by compelling computational model and theories. The AI-ML based approaches have been instrumental in identification, screening, scrutiny of advanced materials, especially MXenes for varied applications via the supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques. These exercises have provided the models that can be potentially more equipped for parallelly performing the classification and regression with a higher prediction accuracy. Use of advanced deep learning techniques have aided in establishing relation between structure-feature-properties and applications for MXenes based materials. Finally, a Criteria based AI aided Decision Support System is also discussed that prioritises environmentally sound and green MAX phase precursors for the development of photocatalytic materials. This will aid in developing technically feasible, economically viable and environmentally sustainable approaches for MXenes commercialization targeting environmentally friendly photocatalytic applications, thereby achieving sustainability development goals.

AB  - Due to the rapid progress in communication technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly capable of providing reliable and cost-effective wireless communication from aerial vantage points. Unlike conventional stationary infrastructure, UAVs exhibit attractive features such as high scalability and improved line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity. Consequently, UAV-assisted wireless communications have become a promising paradigm to enhance coverage and connectivity in terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. Nevertheless, the efficient deployment of UAVs in continuously evolving wireless network scenarios has remained to be a challenging task. These challenges have attracted a large body of research literature and subsequently several survey papers on UAV-assisted wireless communications. One of the distinctive features of research in UAV-assisted wireless networks is its broad array of experimental and analytical tools and techniques. A thorough review of these methodologies can swiftly familiarize researchers with the most recent efforts within this expansive field. However, most of the existing review/survey papers in this domain lack a comprehensive discussion about the advanced technologies used in UAV-assisted wireless networks, such as rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), digital twin (DT), cognitive radio (CR), space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO), integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), quantum technology, holographic MIMO (HMIMO). Motivated by this limitation and considering the novel UAV-assisted communication scenarios that can benefit from the adoption of such technologies; this work provides a thorough analysis of state-of-the-art intertwined technologies relative to UAV-assisted communications along with a discussion of their effectiveness and limitations. Furthermore, this study provides a brief overview of the comprehensive challenges of UAV-assisted networks, along with their security challenges, and opens future direction in this domain. This work finally explores the unique challenges in each of the existing technologies developed for UAV-assisted wireless networks that have been limitedly explored in prior literature aimed at providing a set of directions for future works.

AB  - Advanced control methods proved they effectiveness in reducing energy consumption of refrigeration systems equipped with a variable-speed compressor, but they could not be suitable for fixed-speed compressors, which are usually controlled by a simple ON/OFF logic with a mechanical thermostat, which does not allow to optimize the performance of such devices. Hence, a novel control method based on the use of Artificial Neural Networks to optimize the operations of refrigeration systems equipped with a fixed-speed compressor is proposed. This technique uses an Artificial Neural Network, which stem from a three-step process, able to provide the ON/OFF control loop with the optimal hysteresis value accordingly to the requirement of the user, in terms of set-point temperature and optimization priority, and the ambient temperature. The proposed control method was encoded in a microcontroller to test its effectiveness with a refrigeration system. The results of the experimental tests demonstrated the great potential of this approach showing a reduction of energy consumption of 6.8% and 2.2% with no stored material and ambient temperatures of 25 °C and 32 °C, respectively. Then, the introduction of 45 kg of stored material led to energy savings up to 13.4% and 6.6% with ambient temperatures of 25 °C and 32 °C, respectively. Furthermore, it was evidenced that door openings and pick-and-place operations can reduce the positive effect of this approach, reducing the energy saving to 3.7%. The results show that Artificial Neural Networks can be successfully applied to optimize the ON/OFF control loop of refrigeration systems, considering both plug-in and built-in solutions.

AB  - With the remarkable surge in IT power densities and energy consumption, the data center industry is starting to adopt energy and thermally-efficient single-phase cooling technologies. For many legacy data centers worldwide, the lack of a primary chilled water source is a substantial barrier to adopting single-phase technologies. In this study, the necessity of having a facility chilled water source for deploying liquid cooling solutions is eliminated by introducing a solution that does not require bringing in any modification of the data center layout. This simple solution proposes integrating liquid to air heat exchangers with the floor tiles to eject heat from the liquid-cooled IT equipment into the room air. An experimentally validated CFD modeling approach is used to investigate the performance of these heat exchangers. Results show that by installing two heat exchangers in different cold aisles, a significant amount of cooling load is handled at the design point conditions. When they are tested under different operational conditions, the cooling capacity of these heat exchangers is shown to be sensitive to the supply air temperature. To overcome the operational constraints stemming from the supply air temperature, an alternative configuration with just one heat exchanger installed in the hot aisle is considered and discussed. Results indicate that the second configuration shows superior performance to the first one in terms of sensitivity to supply air temperature and cooling capacity. Lastly, with this configuration, the data center utilizes energy extremely efficiently and achieves a power usage effectiveness of 1.06.

AB  - Acid mine drainage (AMD) generation involves complex interactions of environmental and geological factors, posing formidable management challenges. Extensive research over five decades has aimed to understand AMD processes and mitigate their severe impacts. However, the aquatic environment remains highly vulnerable to AMD risks, with management technologies facing constraints, necessitating ongoing research efforts, while managing AMD sustainably requires continuous monitoring of water quality and site conditions. This study examines AMD, as a pressing environmental concern in mining operations, comprehensively evaluating its sustainable management aspects, including regulation frameworks, categorization by the risk classes, and environmental impact factors. Various challenges and limitations within the field are identified in the review, mostly highlighting the need for alignment with contemporary trends of technology. In response, although some challenges persist, emerging data-based technological approaches such as Artificial Intelligence show promise for early AMD risk identification and maintenance, to preserve the aquatic ecosystems from AMD risks.

AB  - The integration of product-based learning strategies in Materials in Chemical Engineering education is crucial for students to gain the skills and competencies required to thrive in the emerging circular bioeconomy. Traditional materials engineering education has often relied on a transmission teaching approach, in which students are expected to passively receive information from instructors. However, this approach has shown to be inadequate under the current circumstances, in which information is readily available and innovative tools such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality environments are becoming widespread (e.g., metaverse). Instead, we consider that a critical goal of education should be to develop aptitudes and abilities that enable students to generate solutions and products that address societal demands. In this work, we propose innovative strategies, such as product-based learning methods and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) artificial intelligence text generation models, to modify the focus of a Materials in Chemical Engineering course from non-sustainable materials to sustainable ones, aiming to address the critical challenges of our society. This approach aims to achieve two objectives: first to enable students to actively engage with raw materials and solve real-world challenges, and second, to foster creativity and entrepreneurship skills by providing them with the necessary tools to conduct brainstorming sessions and develop procedures following scientific methods. The incorporation of circular bioeconomy concepts, such as renewable resources, waste reduction, and resource efficiency into the curriculum provides a framework for students to understand the environmental, social, and economic implications in Chemical Engineering. It also allows them to make informed decisions within the circular bioeconomy framework, benefiting society by promoting the development and adoption of sustainable technologies and practices.

AB  - Privacy and efficient data processing are crucial research areas in the field of outsourcing computing. Thus, the contribution of the paper is twofold. First of all, we develop a secure offloading technique that can process data while preserving privacy. Although RSA and Paillier cryptosystems are highly beneficial for mathematical operations on basic encrypted data due to their homomorphic properties, images are processed using permutation-ordered binary (POB) and Shamir's secret sharing (SSS). Second, a non-cooperative game theory model was formulated to examine the interactions between service providers, characterizing each edge as an M/M/1 system with an infinite queue. Through formal verification using rigorous mathematical reasoning, the suggested strategies for task offloading and resource allocation are shown to be effective in terms of security, quality of service (QoS), and energy consumption. The best-response dynamics approach is used to calculate the final strategy for each participant and assess how fairly resources are allocated. Finally, the potential of our approach is demonstrated numerically, revealing a faster convergence towards attaining Nash equilibrium in a duopoly cloud-edge data center market, granted that the necessary and sufficient conditions are met.

AB  - The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data resulted in the full potential realization of technologies through convergence. Tremendous acceptance, adoption and implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Agenda 2030, has resulted in original equipment manufacturers (OEM) developing various designs of rotary machines in a bid to improve energy efficiency, with more improvements expected in the coming decade. An effective technique to manage energy efficiency in the smart grid is through integration of demand side management, inclusive of optimization of rewinding of an electric motor in a machine shop. This paper aims to conceptualize application of AI and augmented reality (AR) towards process visibility of remanufacturing rotary machine stators by robotic vision. SLT is the triangulation methodology used in laser scanning for 3D modelling, and instantaneous condition assessment of the core. A pre-defined robotic path is used towards identification of features for range image acquisition. Therefore, the potential of industry 4.0 in resuscitation of end-of-life products through service remanufacturers by RE in a rewinding shop are presented.

AB  - Water quality nowadays, under climate change, has become a risk and challenging problem to save water from deterioration. Advanced solutions such as nanomaterials and artificial intelligence for simulation have become some of the best and essential solutions. Therefore, this study assessed the artificial intelligence models' accuracy in simulating the elimination of Bisphenol A (BPA) using synthesized carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We concluded that the pseudo-second-order model's (R2) correlation coefficient is (0.999) significantly higher than the other models. Because the findings between the Model and Actual Values are so accurate, the adsorption of BPA on CNT could be modeled using the pseudo-second-order model, qe = 144.928(mg/g) and K2 = 0.0016. The correlation coefficient of Pseudo-First-Order model's (R2) is (0.825) qe = 27.107(mg/g) and K1 = 0.0161, and the Intraparticle diffusion model's (R2) is (0.821),qe = 151.98(mg/g) and Kd = 2.4. The Langmuir model performed the best in isothermal experiments, with correlation coefficients of R2 = 0.9441, qm = 181.81, and RL = 0.0375. Based on the information provided, we may conclude that the Langmuir model accounts for more BPA adsorption than the other models. We employed the feedforward neural network (FFNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN). The FFNN achieved a coefficient of 0.971, while the RNN obtained a higher correlation coefficient of 0.98.

AB  - Summary While the local environmental harms of cultivating cannabis outdoors receive considerable attention, those from indoor cultivation are often overlooked. Windowless plant factories and high-tech greenhouses are vastly more energy intensive than open-field cultivation, conventional buildings, and some industries. With US cannabis production more than doubling over the past decade to ∼24 kt/year, the lack of greenhouse gas emissions inventories creates a serious information vacuum. This life cycle assessment finds industry-wide emissions of ∼44 Mt CO2e/year (half from legal producers), equaling those of ∼10 million cars or ∼6 million homes. The underlying 595 PJ/year energy consumption ($11 billion/year) is on par with that of all other crop production, four times that of the pharmaceutical and medicine or beverage and tobacco industries, one-third that of data centers, and half again greater than that of cryptocurrency mining. National legalization alone would achieve only modest reductions, but it could enable more potent policies; the most promising avenue could reduce emissions by up to 76% by shifting more cultivation outdoors.

AB  - This study presents a review of the impacts of Industrial Revolution 4 (IR4) technologies on the oil palm industry, focusing on their applications in enhancing productivity, sustainability, and socio-economic outcomes. Key technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and remote sensing were examined for their roles in various applications. Findings indicate that these technologies have significantly improved palm oil production processes, offering innovative solutions to enhance efficiency while reducing environmental impact. They also contribute to addressing socio-economic challenges such as labour rights issues and transparency in supply chain management. Among 98 of the reviewed studies in this literature review, IR4 technologies were applied the most for oil palm plantation mapping (33.1 %), disease detection (24.8 %) and palm fruit grading (10.8 %). However, challenges like high implementation costs and workforce skill requirements remain as barriers to its widespread adoption. Future research should focus on developing scalable, cost-effective solutions to ensure equitable access across different segments of the industry. Lastly, this review also discussed the potential of Industrial Revolution 5 (IR5) concept to revolutionise the oil palm sector and guide it toward a more human-centric and sustainable future.

AB  - The role of additive manufacturing (AM) for healthcare applications is growing, particularly in the aspiration to meet subject-specific requirements. This article reviews the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance pre-, during-, and post-AM processes to meet a wider range of subject-specific requirements of healthcare interventions. This article introduces common AM processes and AI tools, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. The role of AI in pre-processing is described in the core dimensions like structural design and image reconstruction, material design and formulations, and processing parameters. The role of AI in a printing process is described based on hardware specifications, printing configurations, and core operational parameters such as temperature. Likewise, the post-processing describes the role of AI for surface finishing, dimensional accuracy, curing processes, and a relationship between AM processes and bioactivity. The later sections provide detailed scientometric studies, thematic evaluation of the subject topic, and also reflect on AI ethics in AM for biomedical applications. This review article perceives AI as a robust and powerful tool for AM of biomedical products. From tissue engineering (TE) to prosthesis, lab-on-chip to organs-on-a-chip, and additive biofabrication for range of products; AI holds a high potential to screen desired process-property-performance relationships for resource-efficient pre- to post-AM cycle to develop high-quality healthcare products with enhanced subject-specific compliance specification.

AB  - Changes in travel behaviour are needed to tackle the climate impact associated with long-distance flights, including a switch to sustainable transport modes. In this paper, we analyse scenarios of carbon footprint reduction associated with a switch from flights to night trains for holidays in Europe for the case of Sweden, including outbound, inbound and domestic tourism. We use a prospective lifecycle assessment framework combined with results from a stated preference experiment to determine the impact of future mode shift behaviours. Our results indicate that a mode shift could be triggered by progressive night train policies resulting in (i) fewer transfers and (ii) price levels similar to those of flights. The shifts from flights to night trains could result in 9% lower cumulative carbon footprint in relation to a baseline travel demand scenario for the period 2025–2050. Decarbonization of long-distance travel in line with the Paris Agreement would likely require a combination of many different types of measures including a shift to low-carbon fuels.

AB  - Buildings are central to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, energy labeling programs, intended to encourage sustainable practices, often encounter challenges such as data inaccuracies, manual processes, and discrepancies between estimated and actual energy consumption. This study examines how Building Information Modeling (BIM) can contribute to improving the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of energy labeling, addressing existing gaps in current practices. Through a systematic literature review, the research compiles insights from recent studies that demonstrate BIM's potential to centralize and automate building data, reduce errors in energy assessments, and facilitate integration with Building Energy Modeling (BEM) tools for more consistent simulations. The findings indicate that BIM-based methods, including model generation techniques, multi-objective optimization, and digital twin applications, help mitigate the performance gap by enabling data updates, improving interoperability, and offering better occupant behavior modeling. Nevertheless, several challenges remain, such as ensuring data quality, enhancing open data standards, and refining tools to accommodate evolving energy systems. A key novelty of this review lies in synthesizing a broad range of BIM-driven approaches into a cohesive perspective on how energy labeling can be modernized and enriched. By proposing future research paths that further integrate these BIM-based solutions, this study underscores BIM's capacity to streamline labeling processes through advanced analytics and automation, ultimately supporting more informed retrofits, regulatory compliance, and sustainable design strategies. In summary, the review suggests that BIM can enhance current labeling methodologies and contribute to broader sustainability goals in the built environment.

AB  - Good governance has been associated with an emerging public sector issue and the real political need to satisfy stakeholders by demonstrating accountability and transparency with effective policy implementation. Establish many governance initiatives through the need to improve organizational performance, quality of service, the ability to implement and adapt to change. Cities in general and their historical centres in, particular have faced many problems, pressures, the worst aspects of energy shortages, and the provision of services and infrastructure in the world. Nonrenewable energy is one of the most important problems that always threaten societies, making it one of the most important international concerns and the Millennium Development Goals. Most countries seek to protect their historic cities and centres through conservation policies, laws, and institutions responsible for the preservation of heritage and affected communities. Some succeeded in dealing with these pressures and managed to solve the internal problems (partial or quantitative) to reach the advanced stages of preserving the cultural heritage, while other countries do not have the ability to set their goals. Therefore, there is a difference between the countries of the world in the possibility of identifying appropriate strategies for the renewal and development of historical centres as protected areas, while at the same time able to integrate with other modern cities and meet the needs of development and sustainable energy of their peoples. The research aims to study good governance and knowledge of its requirements as an administrative approach that helps to reflect on multiple visions in planning and decision making and to enhance the ability and efficiency of the governmental sector to achieve the quality of service provided to achieve sustainable energy in the historical centres in Iraqi cities. The main findings of the research are that the achievement of renewable and sustainable energy cannot be effective or reach tangible results unless incorporated into the city's heritage governance and on the basis of the establishment of legitimate government institutions governing the principles of transparency, accountability and the rule of law for all partners to achieve quality of service provided.

The defiance emerged with the creation of the Presidential Commitment No. 21898 of April 11th, 2014, which declared the support to the production of electric vehicles as a preventive measure to reduce the polluting emissions produced by the consumption of fossil fuels that affect the health and increase the greenhouse effect in the planet. For this reason, the Universidad Politécnica Salesiana developed an engagement Project with society that consisted in the diffusion at a national level, of this new technology in High Schools of the city of Guayaquil. This article presents the biannual planning of a series of talks in high schools during the academic period No. 53 and the problems that arise while making students aware about the use of electric and hybrid vehicles technology which favor the United Nations′ goal No. 7 about Affordable and Clean Energy. Finally, through a survey conducted in the Javier High School of Guayaquil, the assessment of the Project is shown which responds to the new technological environment of the XXI century.

AB  - A practical solution to the problem of socioeconomic and environmental development at the regional level requires the development of theory and methods of managing objects in the long period of time (over 20 years). A feature of economic objects with a long operating time is the passage of various stages of the life cycle for which control laws may vary.In this paper the problem of managing objects of the regional economy is considered from the standpoint of managing natural-industrial macrosystems defined as open, multilevel, nonlinear, deterministic-stochastic structures with delayed signal in control and communication channel. These include infrastructural socio-economic facilities such as energy, transport, information, medical, utilities and other systems. To work with them a methodology consisting of eight information blocks is proposed. One of blocks contains a formalized description of control tasks implemented at various stages of the object's life cycle. The work revealed that in the management of such systems for the long term problematic situations arise. This is impending the achievement of the sustainable development goals without evolutionary changes in the structural and functional properties of objects.In this paper the concept of purposeful states set is given, in which natural-industrial macrosystems comes out from problem situations. Particular attention is paid to the stage of nature-industrial macrosystems life cycle, at which the evolution of control objects in accordance with the Darwinian triad takes place.In the case study a project to improve urban wastewater treatment plants is presented. A flexible monitoring and control system has been developed. It can ensure the progress of urban wastewater treatment plants to the predicted sustainable development goals.

AB  - East Africa’s electrification is at odds with United Nations goals to provide clean modern energy for all by 2030 despite possessing a vast potential for Renewable energy (RE). The increasing demand for energy coupled with continuous reliance on non-renewable energy resources as the least-cost power generation option contributes highly to climate change. This study aims to explore the implication of RE transition on the cost of electricity generation and greenhouse gas emission. The study applied a scenario capacity expansion model (System Planning Test) to investigate the implication of changing penetration level of RE from the reference least-cost solution in existing policy documents on the overall costs of building and operating an electrical system and the derived carbon dioxide emission level. The results showed that the relationship between RE and the electricity system cost is nonlinear. This implies that small changes in the level of renewable penetration relative to the least-cost solution result in small changes in the system costs while large deviation leads to large changes in the system costs. The higher levels of RE deployment lead to high reduction of carbon dioxide but with higher overall system costs. While lower levels of RE leads to higher carbon dioxide emission levels at lower system costs. Thus evaluating the trade-off between emission saving and system cost, shows that cost of avoiding emissions is incremental to RE deployment and declines as RE is curtailed. Thus initiatives to promote RE growth in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals have been proposed.

AB  - As a consequence of being one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters, Indonesia targets emission reduction through several strategies, including command and control, infrastructure and technology investment, and market-based mechanisms. Whether the applied strategies are effective measures was unconvincing, as the amount of emission kept increasing. Therefore, this study focused on identifying the roles of market-based regulation on the renewable energy sector, particularly biogas. By employing qualitative content analysis from desks and a systematic literature review, this study was conducted to address the implication of emission incentives and taxation to the biogas market in Indonesia. The result showed that the absence of a clear baseline, price, and trade flow are the main obstacles to maximizing co-benefits between these two terms. Maintaining sustainability and low carbon footprint at every stage of biogas production is also challenging. However, the biogas sector has great potential to get into those market schemes by making its various utilizations as tradable commodities.

AB  - According to the methodology for determining land degradation adopted by the UN for the calculation of the sustainable development goal's (SDG) indicator 15.3.1, land productivity on the basis of remote sensing data is one of the three sub-indicators. At the same time, the process of land degradation is very complex and it has not yet been studied how it is affected by climate changes. This task is complicated by the fact that climate change has consequences in the future. However, satellite data have a long history of observations and therefore we can see, how climate indicators affect the process of land degradation in historical terms. In this paper, we used MODIS satellite data to calculate land productivity and estimated the relationship between land productivity and climate change vulnerability of agricultural water resources (CCV) obtained by SWAT model for Ukraine. Correlation and regression analysis show that the climate change vulnerability of agricultural water resources is one of the indicators of land degradation.

AB  - Management of the sustainable development of regional infrastructure systems (IS) over time intervals of more than 20 years is one of the fundamental scientific problems of modern management theory. In this paper, such control objects, designed to serve the population with resources, goods and services, are considered on the universal scientific platform of natural-industrial systems (NIS), which are purposeful and developing organizations. The meaning of NIS management is associated with ensuring the movement of IS towards sustainable development goals (SDG), characterized by a set of social, economic and environmental factors (indicators) that are important for the life of not only present, but also future generations of citizens. Technological tasks of sustainable development today are being solved on the basis of the ideas of a circular and green economy: complex processing of raw materials and materials, saving resources, organizing nature-friendly technologies, etc. At the same time, the mechanism for transferring existing objects of the regional economy to the trajectory of sustainable development is unclear. Two features in NIS control problems distinguish them from those known in classical control theory: 1 - NIS evolution during long-term operation; 2 - the need to use non-traditional subsystems in the control system: long-term forecasting SDG; medium-term planning of organizational and automatic controls; control over the stability of the movement of NIS to SDG. This paper proposes a hybrid sustainable development management system that combines continuous information flows received from the control object with discrete flows from an expert system for diagnosing problem situations that are arised during the long-term operation of NIS.

AB  - The building sector plays a crucial role in decarbonization, energy transition, and sustainable development strategies, accounting for 40% of global energy consumption and 37% of emissions. Efforts to improve energy efficiency in buildings have been made through standards like the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) in the European Union, resulting in a significant increase in energy-efficient buildings. However, the challenge lies in retrofitting existing buildings, which constitute the majority of the EU building stock and have a slow renewal rate. The EU Renovation Wave strategy aims to accelerate energy renovations in over 35 million buildings. The upcoming review of the EPBD sets the goal of transforming existing buildings into zero-emission structures, emphasizing the exploitation of renewable energy sources. Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are recognized for their versatility and reliability and can contribute significantly to energy efficiency policies. However, the actual availability of exploitable surface area for the integration of PV panels in buildings poses a feasibility challenge. This study provides a rough assessment of the potential for BIPV integration in existing buildings, focusing on residential structures. The findings suggest that, according to EPBD new recast, BIPV systems can cover the primary energy consumption of buildings ranging from 1 to 1.5 floors, depending on the climatic zone. However, deep energy retrofit interventions can further enhance energy efficiency, surpassing regulatory requirements. By considering higher, but feasible building energy performance levels, PV coverage potential can be significantly increased.

AB  - The growing need for sustainability and resource efficiency has led companies to consider transitioning into circular business models. However, selecting the best circular and sustainable alternative remains challenging due to the variety and multidiscipline of environmental, social, and economic indicators. This study introduces a comprehensive set of criteria designed to evaluate the circularity and sustainability of various operational choices for companies within the biomass supply chain. A total of 49 indicators are classified into four main sub-indexes: 20 environmental indicators, five economic indicators, 15 social indicators, and nine circularity indicators. These indicators were selected using a life cycle thinking approach and are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the European Commission framework, aiming to facilitate a successful transition to a circular economy. This set of criteria can be utilized to conduct a comprehensive assessment of sustainability and circularity for biomass companies in the supply chain. Furthermore, it can serve as criterion within decision-support systems to aid in making informed choices.

AB  - A number of policy initiatives over the last three decades have been striving to limit the impacts of global warming, reverse land degradation, stop the loss of biodiversity, protect finite natural resources, and reduce the risks associated with environmental disasters. They are summarized under the umbrella of the United Nations Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which together aim at building the resilience of people and systems to new environmental and socioeconomic conditions in the future.Beyond political will, achieving these objectives and tracking progress requires science, data and technology: sophisticated observation instruments and networks, coordinated modeling experiments, scientific assessments, global data access infrastructures and analytical capacity to process and translate data into relevant information. While some of these endeavors have benefited from international coordination and funding under the umbrella of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and other framework agreements, many still rely on uncoordinated national or international projects, resulting in a proliferation of incompatible, short-lived initiatives. Beyond the waste of time and energy, our main concern is that many solo technological initiatives all solve the same simple problems, deferring work on more complex issues.Advances on the hard global problems of our time requires greater collaboration and innovation. We argue that policy instruments should include technological guidelines, for example mandate the use of international standards for analysis ready data formats, metadata, geodatacubes or machine to machine communication protocols, in order to foster interoperability and software reuse. This would strengthen international collaboration on innovative development, and in turn contribute to the deployment of effective, robust and scientifically credible products to support decision-making and local climate action.

To make rapid improvements with limited resources and special funds, we ranked the 17 SDGs based on factors such as cost and feasibility, as well as interaction effects of SDGs. In this paper, we propose a dynamic scoring mechanism for SDGs based on graph theory, employing the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm and Dijkstra shortest path algorithm. By incorporating the evolving nature of SDGs, the correlation network among the goals is affected, consequently influencing the updated scoring results. The calculation results show that the highest initial score was 11, 12, 13 in SDGs, which are Sustainable Cities and Communities, Sustainable Consumption and Production, and Climate Action. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the influence of reasonable changes in SDGs on the scoring results.

AB  - In the context of the global energy transition, China is promoting the synergistic integration of energy sources, grids, loads and storage through national strategic policies. This paper examines the challenges of integrating volatile new energy sources, such as wind and solar, into the grids of isolated industrial parks (IIPs). It proposes a model to assess and optimize the consumption capacity of these resources to balance energy production with grid demand effectively. Initially, a “resource-power” conversion model is developed to simulate the potential output of wind and solar installations, given the absence of direct connectivity to the grid in newly established IIPs. Then, with the optimization objective of minimizing the overall cost of isolated grid operation, the new energy consumption capacity of IIPs is evaluated, taking into account the actual operating constraints of thermal power units, the maximum new energy consumption that can be technically achieved, and the regulation potential of flexible load participation response to mitigate the impacts caused by fluctuations in new energy sources. Finally, based on the analysis of the actual operation data of the IIPs, the simulation results show that the IIP can be guided by adjusting the installed capacity parameters for planning the installed size of wind and solar in the IIP before connecting to wind and PV. Moreover, fully exploiting flexible load regulation ability can effectively improve the IIP's wind power consumption capacity, which can provide theoretical guidance for optimizing the IIP's scheduling and promoting new energy consumption.

AB  - The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various sectors, enabling seamless connectivity and data exchange between devices. However, the integration of IoT capabilities into conventional electronic systems remains a challenge due to their non-IoT-ready designs. This obstacle often incurs significant costs and complexities. In this context, this paper explores a transformative approach using Single-Board Computers (SBCs) and cloud-based IoT platforms. SBCs, characterized by their affordability, power, and adaptability, serve as pivotal tools in enhancing existing electronic systems. By seamlessly integrating SBCs, conventional devices can gain IoT connectivity, data processing capabilities, and intelligent functionalities. Cloud-based IoT platforms offer scalable solutions for managing and monitoring IoT devices, delivering services such as data storage, analytics, and machine learning. This paper delves into the synergy between SBCs and cloud-based IoT platforms, illustrating how this convergence can empower conventional systems, metamorphosing them into intelligent, adaptive entities. Through insightful case studies, we demonstrate the practical implementation of this approach, showcasing innovative products and services that emerge as a result[1]. Furthermore, the paper critically examines the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating SBCs and cloud-based IoT platforms into conventional systems. Addressing issues such as security, scalability, and energy efficiency, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the complexities involved in this transformative process. In essence, this research sheds light on the transformative potential of combining SBCs and cloud-based IoT platforms, paving the way for a future where conventional electronics evolve into smart, interconnected devices, thereby ushering in a new era of technological advancement and innovation[2].

AB  - Edge-Cloud Datacenters (ECDCs) have been massively exploited by the owners of technology and industrial centers to satisfy the user demand. At the same time, the amount of energy used by these data centers is considerable. To address this challenge, Virtual Machine (VM) placement of the ECDCs plays an important role; therefore, assigning VM properly to physical machines (PM) can significantly decrease the amount of energy consumption. The applied assigning technique simultaneously must consider additional objectives involving traffic and power usage of the network elements, which makes it a challenging problem. This paper proposes a multi-objective VM placement approach in edge-cloud data centers, which uses Seagull optimization to optimize power and network traffic together. In this strategy, the network traffic among PMs is reduced by concentrating the communications of VMs on the same PMs to reduce the amount of transferred data through the network and reduce the PMs’ power consumption by consolidating VMs to fewer PMs, which consumes less energy. We evaluate with simulations in CloudSim and test two different network topologies, VL2 (Virtual Layer 2) and three-tier, to validate that the proposed approach can effectively reduce traffic and power consumption in ECDCs. The experimental results show that our proposed method can decrease energy consumption by 5.5% while simultaneously reducing network traffic by 70% and the power consumption of the network components by 80%.

AB  - Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with electrochemical biosensors is revolutionizing medical treatments by enhancing patient data collection and enabling the development of advanced wearable sensors for health, fitness, and environmental monitoring. Electrochemical biosensors, which detect biomarkers through electrochemical processes, are significantly more effective. The integration of artificial intelligence is adept at identifying, categorizing, characterizing, and projecting intricate data patterns. As the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and big health technologies move from theory to practice, AI-powered biosensors offer significant opportunities for real-time disease detection and personalized healthcare. Still, they also pose challenges such as data privacy, sensor stability, and algorithmic bias. This paper highlights the critical advances in material innovation, biorecognition elements, signal transduction, data processing, and intelligent decision systems necessary for developing next-generation wearable and implantable devices. Despite existing limitations, the integration of AI into biosensor systems shows immense promise for creating future medical devices that can provide early detection and improved patient outcomes, marking a transformative step forward in healthcare technology.

AB  - Detecting anomalies in energy consumption data is crucial for identifying energy waste, equipment malfunction, and overall, for ensuring efficient energy management. Machine learning, and specifically deep learning approaches, have been greatly successful in anomaly detection; however, they are black-box approaches that do not provide transparency or explanations. SHAP and its variants have been proposed to explain these models, but they suffer from high computational complexity (SHAP) or instability and inconsistency (e.g., Kernel SHAP). To address these challenges, this paper proposes an explainability approach for anomalies in energy consumption data that focuses on context-relevant information. The proposed approach leverages existing explainability techniques, focusing on SHAP variants, together with global feature importance and weighted cosine similarity to select background dataset based on the context of each anomaly point. By focusing on the context and most relevant features, this approach mitigates the instability of explainability algorithms. Experimental results across 10 different machine learning models, five datasets, and five XAI techniques, demonstrate that our method reduces the variability of explanations providing consistent explanations. Statistical analyses confirm the robustness of our approach, showing an average reduction in variability of approximately 38% across multiple datasets.

AB  - Main elements of critical FPGA-based information and control systems (I&Cs) security assessment are described. It is proposed to use combination of traditional techniques for reliability and safety analysis: GAP-analysis and IMECA-analysis (modification of FMECA which takes into account intrusion to the system) for analysis of requirements and possible safety and security deficits which could take place during transition between stages of lifecycle of critical FPGA-based I&Cs. The article depicts main steps of assessment, life cycle of safety and security FPGA project development and software tool, which automates the process of assessment. Some challenges regarding to green aspect of safety and security ensuring of energy-critical systems are discussed.

AB  - Intelligent buildings are not imaginable anymore without smart metering devices. Smart metering systems are used not only for the provisioning of instantaneous metering information on commodities, such as electricity, water and gas, to the service providers but also to make this information available to customers. This helps the customers in dynamically adapting their energy consumption behavior. The smart metering devices also help in balancing the power generation and distribution in a smart grid by tailoring the power generation according to the demand. However, the liberalization of the metering market requires few strong security and privacy requirements for the metering data. Smart metering raises many security and privacy concerns. There are worries that the personal information of consumers could be disclosed. There are also concerns about frauds exploiting security vulnerabilities in smart metering systems on a large scale, e.g., making smart meters provide false metering data to the service providers. From a macro perspective, the smart grids, including the smart metering systems and devices can be attacked to bring down the whole grid or at least some parts of the grid, which is a concern of national security. This paper focuses on the security and privacy aspects of the smart metering systems. Potential attackers, security threats and attacks on smart metering systems are listed and the security approaches to address the security issues are presented. A security by design approach for secure smart metering is discussed in the paper. The major results of a security by design approach for smart metering systems developed in the project, entitled “Trusted Computing Engineering for Resource Constraint Embedded Systems Applications”, funded by the European commission, are summarized in the end.

AB  - This work aims to organize selected global targets set by the two international organizations: IEA (International Energy Agency) and IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency), to form pathways for stopping the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, and for reaching a condition of net-zero CO2 emissions through accelerating the transition to clean-energy consumption, thereby decelerating the rate of climate change. In achieving this aim, three energy-emissions-climate (EEC) outlook scenarios are discussed and selected targets from them are listed here after being grouped chronologically, from 2021 to 2050. The majority of these targets (54 total) belong to the years 2030 (23 targets) and 2050 (16 targets). However, the years 2021, 2025, 2035, 2040, and 2045 have one or more targets as well. The outlook scenarios considered here are: (1) Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) of IEA, (2) Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) of IEA, and (3) 1.5°C Scenario by IRENA. The IEA-NZE and IRENA-1.5°C scenarios both imply limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5°C, and reaching global net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The IEA-SDS scenario is less strict, allowing a slightly-higher global temperature increase of 1.65°C and having a later deadline of 2070 for reaching global net-zero CO2 emissions.

AB  - Third parties and legitimate entities can reach and process users' private data through most wireless networks. However, attackers such as intruders and eavesdroppers may also try to exploit this property in communication. Hence, wireless networks are intrinsically more vulnerable to threats, unlike their wired alternatives. Cryptographic techniques are the conventional approaches to deal with that weakness. Nevertheless, they still need to meet the requirements of contemporary technologies, including IoT nodes with energy and processing power constraints. In that respect, friendly jamming (FJ) is one of the encouraging countermeasures to overcome the mentioned susceptibility since it has an energy-efficient and computation-friendly nature. However, that promising approach brings another challenge, applicability. Although various models exist against this issue, a lightweight scheme compliant with novel technologies is needed. Hence, we propose a more straightforward FJ model evaluated on cellular network-based simulations in this study. Moreover, introducing a lightweight secrecy outage probability definition increases robustness and energy efficiency.

AB  - Climate change continues to cause undesirable impacts such as flooding, cyclone, changes in weather and temperature patterns, wild fire amongst others which affect human life, environment, biological habitat and general ecosystem. This study investigates the impact of climate change in South Africa using systematic literature review and provides recommendations on some mitigation strategies. A total of 70 articles were reviewed which discusses the impact of climate change on the environment, road and stormwater infrastructure, engineering design and public administration amongst others. The study also reviews some climate change policies and design standards implemented in South Africa and the reasons for the non-implementation probed the causes of load shedding and its effect on the South African economy. Furthermore, the South African climate change trends particularly the climate trend in the City of Tshwane were discussed. The outcome of this study shows that South Africa presently has no climate change legislation that is fully implemented and that climate change occurrences is traceable mostly to human related activities such as deforestation, bush burning, construction amongst others. To mitigate flooding, an integrated approach to flood management is needed as part of ensuring urban sustainability. Well-managed stormwater drainage is needed due to the increase in urban growth. Master drainage needs to be considered throughout the watershed, regardless of urban and anthropogenic boundaries.

AB  - Aquaculture is a crucial industry required to meet the growing demand for aquatic foods. It is practiced globally in small, medium and large scale, and provides many economic and social benefits such as employment, healthy foods, sustainable food production, and efficient resources utilization. However, the aquaculture ecosystem is faced with environmental pollution issues from plastics and associated toxic organic chemicals and heavy metals like other components of the environment. Furthermore, the changing climate exacerbates the release of plastic litter from both marine and freshwater aquaculture ecosystems. Internal release of worn fishing gears, other plastic equipment, cages and plastic packaging materials facilitate the accumulation of plastic litter in the aquaculture ecosystems. Aquatic organisms ingesting plastic particles and exposed to chemical pollutants are potential threats to food safety, livelihoods and ecosystem health. This article evaluates the impacts that plastic pollution in aquaculture poses on society and recommends mitigation strategies to prevent food safety issues.

AB  - Nations around the world are confronting an increasing demand for renewable energy as the global population continues to rise at a rapid rate. Recognizing the importance of averting climate change, renewable energy options must be not only effective but also sustainable. This study reviews biomass's potential as a renewable energy source, emphasizing on its role in tackling environmental pollution and waste management issues. Biomass is a product of the plant, produced through photosynthesis using sunlight for the conversion of water and carbon dioxide into a composite mix of organic matter such as hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, fats, starch, etc. The review dives at a wide range of biomass feedstocks, such as Examples of biomass are energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass), food crops and crop residue during processing (corn cobs, sugar cane, rice husk, wheat straw, bagasse), horticulture (yard waste), wood or forest residues (dead trees, branches, and tree stumps), animal farming (manure, rich in nitrogen and phosphorous sewage plant), municipal solid waste (paper, grass clippings, food scraps, clothes, furniture, product packaging), etc. It emphasizes how biomass provides a good chance to utilize feedstocks and farm wastes that would otherwise contribute to pollution in the environment. Biomass helps limit the production of greenhouse gases by turning these biomass resources into biofuels such as biodiesel, biomethane, and biochar which can be used as sources of energy. The importance of biomass as a renewable energy option, not only in terms of its potential to create Biofuel but also in terms of its role in minimizing environmental pollution caused by feedstock and farm waste will be duly reviewed. The study further reviews the relevance of long-term biomass usage for environmental and economic viability. It emphasizes the need for responsible biomass feedstock acquisition and effective management across the production and supply chain toward developing sustainable energy systems and tackling climate change.

AB  - In 2015, the United Nations launched 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) with the SDG 7 seeking to address the challenges of an increased energy demand by ensuring the total electrification for the world by 2030. For countries in Africa who face problems of a wide energy access deficit, it is imperative that renewable energy sources are included in the energy generation mix in line with the sustainable objectives. To achieve this goal, energy modelling would play a pivotal role in accessing and forecasting the required energy mixes under different policy climates to avoid wastages. This study was therefore a review of Nigeria’s current energy climates, the potentials of renewable energy penetration and different energy adoptable models.

AB  - The correlation between energy usage and economic growth is widely acknowledged. The placement within the dynamics of Nigeria's economic growth and fossil fuel usage is evaluated in this paper. Retrieved and processed data from reliable databases, such as "Our World in Data" and THE WORLD BANK, covering the years 2005 to 2022, were used to analyze the following: percentage of total primary energy consumption (fossil fuel), percentage of consumption per capita, percentage of total Gross Domestic Product (GDP), percentage of GDP per capita, and overall Human Development Index (HDI). The results showed fluctuations in GDP growth rates in tandem with stable energy consumption, a continuous reliance on fossil fuels in the face of a slow but steady rise in the HDI, and economic difficulties in certain years in spite of stable energy consumption. In contrast to predictions, the country's HDI, which has been rising steadily over time, was mostly unaffected by the non-linear link between GDP and fossil fuel usage. The study also showed variations in Adjusted Net Savings, indicating the unpredictability of the country's energy sector in the face of political and economic unpredictability. Notwithstanding these obstacles, the HDI showed a slow but noticeable improvement, suggesting that the income and savings Nigeria's petroleum resources provide to its population are not very beneficial. Considering the findings, policy-based recommendations were also offered.

AB  - Urbanisation has increased the need for sustainable urban development by positioning smart cities as critical frameworks for addressing environmental, economic, and social challenges. This study evaluates the sustainability strategies of three leading smart cities Zurich, Oslo, and Copenhagen by examining their environmental footprint, energy consumption, waste management, and air quality. The study uses a PRISMA-based systematic literature review to put together evidence from peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2024. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) was used to assess the quality of the articles. The study reveals that smart mobility and waste-to-energy systems drive Zurich’s strengths in urban densification and public transportation, Oslo’s leadership in renewable energy and electric mobility, and Copenhagen’s ambitious carbon–neutral initiatives. Despite these achievements, challenges such as high implementation costs, slow technological adoption, and social equity issues persist, emphasising the complexity of achieving inclusive and sustainable urban evolution. To address these challenges, this study recommends increasing public participation through inclusive urban planning and digital platforms, strengthening policy frameworks, and funding for sustainability projects, and investing in data collection technologies to monitor real-time environmental impacts. Furthermore, fostering cross-city collaboration and addressing energy consumption challenges associated with AI and IoT are essential for scaling successful models globally. These insights offer actionable guidance for policymakers and urban planners to improve sustainability strategies and ensure long-term benefits.

AB  - The construction and building industry, one of the greatest emitters of greenhouse gases, is under tremendous pressure because of the growing concern about global climate change and its detrimental effects on societies. Given the environmental problems connected to cement production, geopolymer concrete has become a viable alternative. In addition, if the concrete strength results failed to meet the specified strength after being cast, modifications are impossible. Thus, it is particularly desirable to predict strength prior to casting concrete. This study presents the first effort in applying deep neural networks (DNN) of AI techniques to predict the mechanical strengths (GGBFS) of geopolymer concrete (GPC) produced from corncob ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag. The mixes were activated with 12–16 M of alkali solutions at ambiently cured conditions for 7–90 days. Following that, back propagation learning algorithms were created for forecasting the concrete strengths based on concrete mix proportions. The mechanical strengths estimated by the DNN were verified by laboratory testing results. Results revealed that GGBFS, mix grade, curing days, and alkali precursor are variables that govern the mechanical strengths of the GGBFS-CCA-GPC. Forecasting the mechanical properties of GPC produced using DNN shows that the relationship between the input and output arguments could be most accurately predicted by a 10–20–20–20-1 network topology, evident by approximately 99% correlation coefficient between the actual and predictive values for compressive and flexural strengths. However, the 10–17–17–17-1 network architecture showed the best DNN for predicting split tensile strength, with a 97% correlation coefficient between the actual and projected values. This study demonstrated that the DNN techniques are efficient in predicting the mechanical strengths of GPC based on the mix proportions. Application of these techniques will greatly advance concrete quality assurance.

AB  - The motivation of this paper is to assess and compare Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperation (APAC) countries’ risk profiles that impact data centers’ (DCs) effectiveness. Because of the importance of DCs, security to protect a DC from external threats and attacks is an issue to be addressed. However, the conflicted nature of the evaluation criteria (such as infrastructure, energy, natural, business, political, and legal risks) makes it difficult to assess the countries’ profiles. The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic evaluation methodology using two different multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches, namely spherical fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (SF-AHP) and EDAS (evaluation based on distance from average solution). While SF-AHP is preferred to prioritize the main and sub-criteria under imprecise decision making environment, EDAS is used to rank the countries’ DC profiles embedding the obtained criteria weights. The results of the methods have been compared with the ranking results presented in the report called as Data Centre Security Index (DCSI) is published by Technology Research Project Corporate (TRPC). Consequently, Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand rank in the top three due to their high electrification rates and secure internet servers.

AB  - Transport sector's fuel mix which is dominated by the fossil fuel imposes multiple external costs like energy security, air quality and climate change. In this study, alternate future scenarios are designed to explore the transitions of national transport system (till 2050). Several policy options are delineated that would facilitate the sustainable low carbon transformation of India's transport sector. The long term energy and emission trajectory of India's transport sector is assessed under alternate scenarios using the integrated assessment modelling framework. Co-benefits like energy security and local air quality that can be accrued by mainstreaming climate change polices into national sustainable development goals and sectoral plans are also estimated. There is no silver bullet that would enable the transition towards low carbon transport. An optimal mix of policies that includes fuel economy standards, modal shifts and cleaner energy supply is required to align climate and sustainable development goals in the long-term.

Although a lot of attention has been paid to it, the idea of ‘smart’ still seems to be misunderstood in traditionally planned cities and the sociocultural values that express their identity have been overlooked. To validate the concern, this study analyses literature studies on smart sustainable traditional cities from 2005 to 2020 through an extensive review of research papers. Qualitative methodology and PRISMA have been used to bring forth core issues paving way for future studies on smart planning without compromising their associated values.

AB  - First off, both those uprooted by war and natural calamities go through extremely comparable human experiences. For instance, those who are relocated due to both flooding and warfare frequently lose family members, go through family division, lose their things, and suffer from stress and sadness. They both require support and protection. They misplace crucial papers, which prevents them from using public services. They lose property, and it can be years (or never) before they are paid for it. Vulnerable people suffer more during armed conflicts and natural calamities. For instance, 3–4 women pass away for every adult male who drowns in a flood worldwide.Children who have been uprooted due to a natural catastrophe or armed conflict are frequently more open to being enlisted in the military forces. Discrimination against vulnerable populations in the provision of aid is also common. Food is often given to strong, healthy males before it is given to children or people with disabilities in many of the camps where people who have been displaced by violence dwell, at least at first. Additionally, African-American neighborhoods, immigrants, and the elderly in New Orleans were disproportionately affected by Hurricane Katrina.Unfair access to aid, discrimination in aid delivery, forced relocation, sexual and gender-based violence, loss of documentation, enlisting children in the armed forces, unsafe or involuntary return or resettlement, and problems with property restitution are among the issues that people affected by the effects of natural disasters frequently face. These share characteristics with the issues faced by those who have been displaced by hostilities.Displacement is a common occurrence that reflects how vulnerable individuals are to dangers everywhere. Exposure grows as a result of the vulnerability of the population living in risky locations, which is on the rise. The main aim is to find the support to the people displaced using the wireless networks data and finding disturbance using the hierarchical clustering algorithm.

The relation between supply chain management and the circular economy is examined in this paper, as well as the future trends of these two areas. The methodology involved content analysis after identifying current relevant research from the Scopus database. A substantial increase in studies on the association of these two areas relates to the implementation of a 3R or 5R approach to supply chain management. Future trends have been identified for three industry sectors: manufacturing, natural resources, and services, all of which are moving in the direction of applying both of these areas to processes in order to reduce resource use, waste, and environmental impact in order to achieve sustainability. The findings will guide these industries in planning and developing these two areas within the organization in order to deal with business changes.

These variables were used as indicators to measure how viable the project is financially.It is worth mentioning that this software was designed by the Canadian government, and it is widely used in the decision making for clean energy projects. It uses a quantitative technique to estimate the costs and benefits and the return on investment of the project in a certain period of time and thus evaluate the feasibility of the project and its economic viability.This calculation will help us consider sustainable projects that will help achieve the United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals in Mexico. These goals are also present within the 2030 agenda, and protection is also included within these goals.This kind of projects related to the use and destruction of methane to generate biogas are called clean development mechanism (MDL) projects and are considered internationally a source of environmental benefits and economic income for countries.

AB  - Global warming and unpredictable weather patterns have garnered significant attention and anxiety across global forums. The need to mitigate climate change between 1.5℃ (Celsius) to 2℃ and the ways to reverse greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been in the making for a decade now with its core structure insisting on carbon neutrality formulated through Conference of Parties (COP26) with accelerated targets across global countries. In terms of Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, India ranks third next to United States; its CO2 emission are about one-fourth of China which leads global CO2 emission [1]. With a very steady Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and increasing industrial output, India has determined itself to meet its climate action obligation through National Determined Contribution (NDC) and sustainable alternatives in the Energy, transport, and other sectors. Transport decarbonization, reduction of non-fossil fuels in energy sector and replacing sustainable alternative across sectors are at key focus, from urban housing to farming supported through cleaner technology, smart innovation, continuous investment with government collaboration and support. With India's huge market potential across sectors driven by strong consumer strength and talents across industrial growth and consistent GDP's, the growth in sectors can only accelerate leading towards largest economy. The Scope of this journal is to analyze India's carbon neutrality commitments leveraged by circular economy across sectors, its targets, and the proposed plan. It will also assess the effectiveness of government standards, policies, and regulations through the author's eyes, and to summarize, interpret, and conclude that as a country, India's stand towards carbon neutrality short-term and long-term goals by 2030 and 2070 respectively.

AB  - Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) are integral to marine exploration yet confront significant security concerns. In contrast to terrestrial WSNs, underwater acoustic channels are characterized by their constrained bandwidth, considerable propagation delays, and a higher bit error rate. These factors facilitate adversaries’ ability to intercept network transmissions and acquire sensitive data. Furthermore, the constraints of energy resources in UWSNs pose additional challenges in harmonizing privacy preservation with energy conservation. This study introduces a novel Privacy-Preserving Data Fusion Algorithm (DSPDA) tailored for UWSNs. The DSPDA circumvents the shortcomings of conventional privacy algorithms by employing dynamic sharding to minimize transmission demands and augment data fusion precision, which adjusts the size of data shards relative to nodal distances, thereby safeguarding confidentiality. Furthermore, it enhances network-wide energy optimization by aligning the energy consumption of cluster heads with their respective child nodes, thus averting disproportionate energy depletion and potential network dysfunction. Our simulation results demonstrate that the DSPDA algorithm notably diminishes communication overhead by approximately 37% in comparison to the SMART algorithm and delivers a further 20% efficiency improvement over the EEHA algorithm.

AB  - This paper makes the case for integration of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) into the Smart City concept. Analysis of sustainability indicators such as carbon footprints, climate resilience, circular economies, biodiversity and selected social assets (for instance, local communities and their safety and security), might provide useful data and information on sustainability performance and risk and opportunities across assets in the built environment. EU Taxonomy and European Sustainability Reporting Standards offer a basis for consistent and granular gathering of information. This information can be embedded into Digital Twins to serve as a multi-purpose sustainability data platform. ESG ‘Digital Twins’ might, therefore, be a powerful tool for addressing sustainability and resilience challenges. They may also offer significant potential in contributing to strong sustainable social, environmental and economic outcomes based on continuous improvement.

AB  - To strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, Parties to the Paris Agreement agree to keep a global temperature rise well below 2-degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels within this century and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5-degrees Celsius. Thailand ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016 and pledged its first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Subsequently, Thailand's updated NDC 2022 intends to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30 percent from the projected business-as-usual (BAU) level by 2030. The level of contribution could increase up to 40 percent, subject to adequate and enhanced access to technology development and transfer, financial resources, and capacity building support of 40% emissions reduction in 2030 compared to its BAU. Presently, Thailand increases its ability to deal with the impacts of climate change and makes the updated NDC consistent with a low GHG emissions and climate-resilient pathways of the Paris Agreement. To reach the ambitious goals, appropriate mobilization and provision of financial resources need to be put in place. The Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) is an important initiative that facilitates collaboration between Japan and partner countries including Thailand to address GHG emissions reduction thru low-emission technologies. The JCM serves as a bridge for global climate action, promoting sustainable development while addressing climate challenges. The bilateral co-operation of JCM between Thailand and Japan was effective since October 13, 2015, and will be ended by December 2030. The JCM credits used to achieved Japan's NDC are based on the proportion of shared investments in the JCM projects. Japan may share the JCM investment as high as 50 percent. This paper proposes a multicriteria decision analysis (MCA) to selection of low-carbon emitting technologies under Thailand-Japan JCM for achievement of Thailand's carbon neutrality 2050. Results indicates five promising categories of JCM projects in Thailand: (i) energy efficiency improvement, (ii) renewable energy and biofuels, (iii) advanced electric devices, (iv) advanced thermal devices, and (v) advanced technologies including hydrogen and carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS). In terms of technological readiness and economics, both energy efficiency improvement and renewable energy measures are found cost effective and suitable for domestic actions while advanced electric devices and advanced thermal devices need JCM framework. The advanced technologies including hydrogen CCS, CCUS and bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) need in-dept assessment for JCM. Thus, the JCM facilitates diffusion of leading decarbonizing technologies and infrastructure as well as implementation of mitigation actions and contributes to sustainable development of Thailand.

AB  - Energy, its use and management, weighs heavily on the burden that each society can impose on a fragile balance of nature, with implications not only environmental and financial, but also social, creating jobs and improving quality of life. Devising strategies that combine these three factors are a valuable option that will yield good results, meeting the challenge of fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The most important thing is to implement the old maxim: "no one is left behind", so low developed countries are an opportunity to achieve impressive results, while allowing them to improve their way of life and their comfort. It’s often said that ‘action begets reaction’, so any positive action taken in the community can have social repercussions, such as improving the quality of education and knowledge about sustainability. This study will provide an overview of how energy management and environmental mitigation strategies can impact underdeveloped countries.

AB  - With the extensive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), construction engineering and management (CEM) is experiencing a rapid digital transformation. Since AI-based solutions in CEM has become the current research focus, it needs to be comprehensively understood. In this regard, this paper presents a systematic review under both scientometric and qualitative analysis to present the current state of AI adoption in the context of CEM and discuss its future research trends. To begin with, a scientometric review is performed to explore the characteristics of keywords, journals, and clusters based on 4,473 journal articles published in 1997–2020. It is found that there has been an explosion of relevant papers especially in the past 10 years along with the change in keyword popularity from expert systems to building information modeling (BIM), digital twins, and others. Then, a brief understanding of CEM is provided, which can be benefited from the emerging trend of AI in terms of automation, risk mitigation, high efficiency, digitalization, and computer vision. Special concerns have been put on six hot research topics that amply the advantage of AI in CEM, including (1) knowledge representation and reasoning, (2) information fusion, (3) computer vision, (4) natural language processing, (5) intelligence optimization, and (6) process mining. The goal of these topics is to model, predict, and optimize issues in a data-driven manner throughout the whole lifecycle of the actual complex project. To further narrow the gap between AI and CEM, six key directions of future researches, such as smart robotics, cloud virtual and augmented reality (cloud VR/AR), Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), digital twins, 4D printing, and blockchains, are highlighted to constantly facilitate the automation and intelligence in CEM.

AB  - Individuals globally spend about 88–92% of their entire time in the indoor environment. The implementation of regularly scheduled systems operation is common in many commercial and residential building types. Occupant Behavior (OB) is highly stochastic, making it difficult to depict the human factor using simple schedules. In the present work, window-opening tendencies were found to be highest in summer and transition seasons and lowest during winter. The Air Changes per Hour (ACH) value obtained from blower door testing was compared with the average ACH value obtained from the mass balance equation. These ACH values were imported to the EnergyPlus model. A three-hidden layered deep neural network was developed to predict the window's state at 16 residential dorms. The data was collected from August 2021 to May 2022 to train and test the DNN models. 48 windows’ operations were measured during this timeframe and 48 DNN models were created with an average accuracy of 96.71% and an average True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.9136. Bedroom windows were found to be more time-dependent than living room windows. Incorporating time components into the bedroom window opening models can increase the TPR by 0 to 6%. The models were then integrated into the Energy Plus simulation engine using the newly introduced Python API to simulate the total HVAC energy consumption during the occupied heating season of 2021–2022. The DNN coupled model predicts 16,350 kWh energy is lost through windows from eight homes in an occupied heating season.

AB  - Reducing carbon footprints has become a pertinent global issue. The creation of carbon footprints is germane in the food supply chain owing to food-wastage. Food is a valuable commodity that not only quickly transforms to waste but also adversely impacts the environment. It leads to loss of labour hours, futile resources, unfed lives, lost profits and an increase in environmental hazards. With this backdrop, the present study aims to identify the key enablers which are crucial in diminishing the inefficiencies across the entire food supply chain. Interpretive structural modelling and matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to classification techniques are used to understand the interdependence of the shortlisted enablers. The study provides holistic and practical insights to the stakeholders for improving the effectiveness of their firms by level partitioning the enablers as ‘givens’ (regulations and governance), ‘means’ (technology, financial implication, perishability, logistics and traceability) and ‘ends’ (inventory management, storage, collaboration, trust, hygiene, packaging and information sharing). The research findings will facilitate the strategic decision making regarding the reduction in the wastage of food thereby diminishing the level of carbon footprint creation. Apart from providing significant implications for the policymakers, the results also add the theoretical implications in the extant literature.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture holds a key role in attaining a balanced approach to increase productivity, especially for growing industries like mushroom production. Producers like China, the USA, and the UK lead the race for global mushroom production, while India lags with 0.18 million tonnes of output. However, ensuring the sustainability of the mushroom industry is needed for environmental conservation, long-term economic viability, and the overall well-being of communities dependent on this agricultural sector. This review focuses on the recent trends in waste and carbon footprint generation from the mushroom industry, emphasizing spent mushroom substrate and utilities like electricity. Moreover, this review extensively covers recent advancements in research concerning incorporating innovative technologies such as AI and precision agricultural technologies like Internet-of-Things (IoT) and big data and contemporary approaches, such as solar energy in mushroom farming. The challenges the mushroom industry faces, and policies to tackle them and promote sustainable agriculture are also thoroughly explored. The review concludes that the carbon footprint generation and waste release from mushroom production can be mitigated using AI, IoT, big data, machine learning, integrated sensors, etc., by increasing production efficiency and optimizing processes. Conventions such as circular economy, conventional energy substitution, carbon credit, and carbon capturing can also alleviate carbon emissions and carbon footprint. Therefore, this will allow the mushroom industry to align with Sustainable Development Goals 7 (affordable and clean energy) and 13 (climate action). Moreover, there is an urgent need to refine the schemes and provisions to make mushroom cultivation a sustainable agricultural sector.

AB  - Sugarcane bagasse ash is an agricultural and industrial waste material produced in millions of tonnes annually. While traditionally used as a fertilizer or buried underground, incorporating this material into concrete production not only reduces cement usage and addresses environmental concerns but also enhances the mechanical properties of concrete. This research aims to investigate the predictive capabilities of various Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, including radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR), for estimating the compressive strength of concrete containing sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA). A dataset comprising 1819 data points from previous studies was collected, consisting of three main groups: 340 data of concrete with SCBA, 459 data of concrete without SCMs, and 1020 concrete data incorporating other supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs). The dataset was utilised in three different ways to evaluate the influence of data on model performance. Firstly, models were trained solely on SCBA data (Group A); subsequently, SCBA data was combined with concrete data without any SCMs (Group B); finally, the entire dataset was utilised (Group C). Statistical analysis revealed that the SVR model trained on SCBA data and the RBFNN model trained on group B data demonstrated the best results and accuracy. However, further refinement of the concrete without SCMs data in group B led to improved model performance, surpassing even that of the SVR model trained on group A data.

AB  - In recent years, with a rise in climate change, the notion of natural resource managementhas received much attention worldwide. The heavy reliance of both developed and developing economies on mineral resource management (MRM) is an important aspect of the debate.Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-based financial management (FM) have transformed the day-to-day operations and management prospects of ecological resources. The present research examines the relationship between AI-based FMand MRM.The study has been done for the economy of the United States of America (USA) and the time ranges from the year 1980–2020.Firstly, the stationarity of the variables are checked using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF),Phillips-Perron (PP)and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) tests.The findings reveal that all the variables follow I(1). The BDS testing is employed for checking the non-linearity among the variables under consideration. The results verify the presence of nonlinearity. Then, the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) approach is used to find the asymmetric effect of FM on mineral resource rent(MRR). The findings provide evidence of an asymmetric relationship between FM and MRR. Such that the positive shock of FM is negatively related to MRR while a negative shock is positively related to MRR. Based on findings, the study suggests that the USA economy must redesign its mineral resource strategy to establish AI-based financial systems for improving MRM by assuring worker safety and efficiency in the mining industry, resulting in long-term growth.

AB  - In this study, an artificial intelligence-based machine vision system was developed for in-line particle size analysis during the pellet layering process. Drug-layered pellets were produced by coating microcrystalline cellulose cores with an ibuprofen-containing layering liquid until the target drug content was achieved. Drug content increases with pellet size; therefore, particle size monitoring can ensure product safety and quality. The direct imaging system, consisting of a rigid endoscope, a light source, and a high-speed camera, provides real-time information about pellet size and layer uniformity, enabling timely intervention in the case of out-of-spec products. A convolutional neural network-based instance segmentation algorithm was employed to detect particles in focus, ensuring that pellet size could be accurately determined despite the dense flow of the particles. After training the model, the performance of the developed system was assessed by analysing the particle size distribution of pellet cores with variable sizes within the 250–850 μm size range. The endoscopic system was tested in-line at a larger scale during the drug layering of inert pellet cores. The particle size data acquired in real time with the endoscopic imaging system corresponded with the reference methods, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed machine vision-based method as a process analytical technology tool for in-line process monitoring.

AB  - Summary Electrocoagulation (EC) has been a well-known technology for wastewater treatment over the past centuries, owing to its straightforward equipment requirements and highly effective contaminant removal efficiency. This literature review emphasizes the influence of several input variables in the EC system such as electrode materials, applied current, pH, supporting electrolyte, and inner-electrode distance on effluent removal efficiency and energy consumption. Besides that, depending on the intrinsic properties of effluents, EC is recommended to hybridize with other methods such as physical-, biological-, chemical-, and electrochemical methods in order to enhance removal performance and reduce energy consumption. Subsequently, a comprehensive analysis of EC performance is presented, including power consumption, and evaluation of the synergistic effect of multiple input variables using statistical methods. Finally, this review discusses future perspectives such as the environmentally friendly utilization of post-EC treated sludges, the development of renewable energy-driven EC systems, and the challenges of EC management by artificial intelligence.

AB  - Securing visibility and dependable information from stakeholders poses a significant challenge for companies engaged in supply chain management. Timely and accurate information exchange is crucial for assessing factors such as carbon emissions and consumer demand. This paper explores the impact of digital and carbon reduction technologies on supply chain decisions, incorporating fuzzy logic and blockchain technology for enhanced decision-making. We specifically focus on a single buyer ordering from a vendor, where faulty items are promptly returned upon inspection. The lead time for the initial delivery includes both production and non-productive time, while successive deliveries only entail transportation time. The research employs intuitionistic triangular fuzzy numbers to represent all carbon factors and integrates blockchain technology to improve demand forecasting. The purpose is to determine the optimal strategies to minimize the carbon and joint total cost of the system. A solution methodology has been proposed for determining optimal strategies, illustrated through a numerical example. The optimal decisions are compared, both with and without blockchain, to validate the proposed model. The findings suggest that blockchain has a substantial impact on both optimal decision-making and the results of carbon reduction efforts. Sensitivity analysis reveals that a blockchain-based supply chain is both time- and cost-efficient, reduces costs and errors in data information, and efficiently shortens lead time in the network.

AB  - This chapter deals with applications of artificial intelligence and more particularly of artificial neural network (ANN) methods for transport demand. First, the structure of a biological and of an artificial neuron, the fundamental functions of an ANN, analogies between artificial and biological neurons, and the activation function of an ANN are explained. The various types of ANN, algorithms, and software are presented afterward. The structure of an ANN (input layer, output layer, hidden layer), the propagation rule (feedforward, backpropagation, recurrent), the method of supervision of learning (supervised learning, reinforced learning, nonsupervised learning), and the learning rule (error correction, Hebbian, Boltzman, Perceptron) are extensively analyzed. Similarities and differences of ANN and statistical and econometric methods are surveyed: assumptions, mechanism and processes, nonlinearities, collinearities, fluctuations of data. A step-by-step analytical example of an application of ANN for the long-term forecast of air transport demand is scrupulously studied and explained: architecture of the ANN model, single and multiple inputs, data and software, propagation rule (feedforward, recurrent), number of iterations, errors. Another application of ANN for the analysis of rail demand is explained in detail. Applications of ANN for the analysis of other sectors of transport are also discussed: road traffic, road safety, driver behavior, self-driven vehicles, freight transport, maintenance needs, performance and quality of service, effects of unpredicted events, and transport economics.

AB  - With the deepening of port electrification, the further coupling of energy flow system and logistics system will be a key feature of the port integrated energy system (PIES) in the future. In order to fully exploit the flexible resources of the logistics system and promote the optimal allocation of resources, this paper proposes a novel energy hub (EH) planning model for the PIES considering the energy consumption regulation of the logistics system. First, the energy consumption of each link of the logistics system is modeled, and the basic framework of the PIES is built to analyze the energy consumption regulation of the logistics system. Then, with the objective function of minimizing the total cost, the planning model of PIES considering the energy consumption regulation of the logistics system is constructed. Finally, according to whether or not to consider adjustable characteristics, two cases are carried out, based on an actual example in Tianjin Port, China. On the basis of comparative analysis, the positive effect on reducing equipment capacity and investment costs is verified effectively.

AB  - The understanding of glacier and ice shelf front changes is of paramount importance in analyzing their material balance and their significant contributions to global sea-level variations. Recently, the increasing availability of remote sensing images has provided ample data support for calving front detection. By combining massive amounts of data, deep learning techniques have demonstrated great potential in front extraction, as they can automatically generate task-specific features. In this study, in contrast to the traditional framework based on a pure convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, we propose a novel calving front detection network, global–local attention Swin-transformer-based DeepLabv3+ (GLA-STDeepLab), by incorporating the Swin-transformer module into DeepLabv3+ to enhance the modeling capability of long-range contextual dependencies. We also introduce global–local attention (GLA) mechanisms into the module, striving to foster interactions between the corresponding coarse and fine-grained feature maps. Through extensive experimentation on a diverse and challenging synthetic aperture radar (SAR) database, CaFFe, our network is shown to surpass the current state-of-the-art methods, achieving results with an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.94 and a mean distance error (MDE) of 473 ± 34 m. More meaningfully, we extracted the time-series front information of the Amery Ice Shelf (AIS) from 2015 to 2023 and precisely captured the calving events of the D-28 and D-32 icebergs. The findings demonstrate that our method enables precise monitoring of the dynamic information of glacier and ice shelf fronts, as well as their far-reaching implications for ice sheet mass balance and global climate change. The code used in this study is provided at https://github.com/Tangyu35/Calving-front-detection.

AB  - The rapid advancement of emerging technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT), including the evolution of Digital Twins (DT), necessitates an accelerated pace in the Beyond Fifth Generation (B5G). This is crucial to establish widespread wireless access by ensuring resilient and immediate wireless connectivity within the real network environment. This article uses edge networks and DTs with blockchain technology. Ensuring robust real-time data processing while providing a scalable and secure solution is the aim. Bridging the gap between digital systems and physical edge networks is the goal. In this research, we bridge the gap between physical edge networks and digital systems by introducing Networks with Digital Twin Edges (NDITE), which combine digital twins and edge networks. Next, we propose a blockchain-driven federated learning method in NDITE to improve data privacy and communication security. We schedule relaying users and manage bandwidth resources using DT- powered Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to increase efficiency. According to the simulation results, the suggested DRL agent-based DT can minimize the weighted cost of transmission policy of edge computing strategies and choose 47.5% of computing tasks to be completed locally with 1 MHz of bandwidth. It can also exploit the optimal policy.

AB  - Sustainable development is an essential target of many islands throughout the world, especially in Europe. One of the requirements for achieving this goal is the reduction of the use of fossil resources: among various possible options a much larger integration of photovoltaic and hybrid systems in the overall energy balance of the islands is desirable. Under these circumstances, the RESPIRE project co-funded by the European commission in the framework of the fifth framework programme, is a global strategic initiative taken at the level of 7 European countries in order to promote the achievement of 100% of RES in the electricity consumption of the insular territories of the Union. Preliminary enquiries carried out by the consortium show that the current share of RES within the 5 islands of the project is approx. 15%. The purpose of the project is to increase this ratio to almost 45% in 3 years, in order to reach a critical threshold and to provide the guidance demonstrating the feasibility of the 100% target, in the near future.

AB  - Sustainable growth and development of nations requires strategic vision and plan to accommodate growing energy needs while preserving and protecting the natural environment. Studies that couple energy and environment often present conflicting objectives which requires the explicit use of quantitative models to develop appropriate solutions for policy planning and analysis. Goal programming offers an analytical framework to solve multi-objective problems that simultaneously satisfy decision maker's preferences. In this paper we develop a polynomial goal programming model to study the effects of electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions applied to the economy of United Arab Emirates. The results provide valuable insights for improvement opportunities and quantitative justification for the required investments and efforts in implementing sustainable development plans.

AB  - In the face of the double whammy of energy crisis and environmental impact of conventional power plants, renewable energy sources come to the rescue. The international community is in search for mechanisms to abet climate change issues. Flexible mechanisms like Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) evaluate sustainable development contribution of the energy projects for granting financial assistance. In case of projects competing for same source of investment, a project having a higher positive contribution to sustainable development is given priority. In the absence of reliable data, the process is overwhelmingly qualitative and hence presents a bottleneck in the decision making process. The present study proposes multi-criteria decision making techniques for quantitative evaluation of sustainability. A set of sustainable development objectives and criteria are selected. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used for determination of criteria weights. Compromise Programming (CP) is used for comparing projects across criteria. Four registered CDM projects are used for illustrating the proposed approach.

The criteria referred to include setting and infrastructure (SI); energy and climate change (EC); waste (WS); water (WR); Transportation (TR) and education (ED). Each of these criteria was elaborated as a number of indicators compiled by mutual agreement between UIGMWUR coordinators and initiators. Reflecting on the results of the assessment in 2018, for each category are, SI reach 15%, EC category reach 25%, WS category reach 21%, WR category reach 0%, TR category reach 36% and ED category reach 46% from the maximum 100% for each. There are plenty things that need to be addressed and improved to realize President University as a green and sustainable campus. An important point that needs to be underlined is, ratification of the UIGMWUR criteria is not only aimed solely at getting the title of a green and sustainable campus, but more towards making the university a driving force for awareness of the importance of preserving our environment.

However, devices such as smart meter in the network face the issue of disclosing user privacy when collecting, processing, and transmitting large amounts of data. To solve this problem, this paper puts forward a scheme based on improved group signature and homomorphic encryption, using improved group signature to determine the public and private key of smart meter and the signature of electricity data, encrypting and aggregating the electricity data with homomorphic encryption. Finally, in the transmission of data, the electricity data is always in the form of ciphertext, and the group signature scheme with forwarding security can avoid the harm caused by the disclosure of the private key, thus playing a role in privacy-preserving.

AB  - The growth of urbanization is a phenomenon that seriously threatens sustainability. According to United Nations estimates, by 2050 the urban population will reach 68% of the global population. Although cities occupy only 3% of the earth's surface, they are responsible for 70% of energy consumption, and 75% of carbon emissions. This urbanization trend is causing increasing pressures on the limited resources available, pressures not compatible with sustainable development. For this reason, governments will have to commit themselves to finding strategies to keep urban centres as places of work and prosperity, where the territory and resources are not damaged, and services are managed in an intelligent and conscious way. The “smart cities” are born to meet these needs, and are places that aim to be economically sustainable, energy self-sufficient, and attentive to the living conditions and needs of its citizens. In this research work, it has studied how a correct management of energy efficiency and electric transport within a smart city can influence its competitiveness and sustainability.

AB  - The advent of information and communication technologies has paved the way for smart cities. Residential customers are the major consumers of electrical energy in such cities. Smart meters gather the energy consumption behavior of consumers at the aggregate/household level. Characterization of aggregate demand data has several advantages but significant benefits in terms of energy sustainability require Appliance Level Energy Characterization (ALEC). Various solutions for ALEC rely on sensors, smart plugs, smart appliances, smart meters, and/or energy disaggregation algorithms but smart meters with built-in energy disaggregation algorithms seem to be the most scalable option. This work is one of the pioneering contributions to present comprehensive applications and prospects of ALEC for smart residential communities. It also links these applications with 2050 decarbonization pathways and various United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs). Prospective uses of ALEC in diverse fields such as power systems, health care, the social sciences, economics, surveillance, marketing, appliance manufacturing, technology development, etc. are highlighted. Moreover, the requirements and challenges hindering the large-scale deployment of the ALEC frameworks are outlined with some recommendations and open research directions. It is envisaged that ALEC of residential electricity can be exploited not only for achieving 2050 decarbonization targets but also for several 2030 SDGs. This work will provide a one-stop source of information on ALEC and will open the doors of cooperation among various stakeholders of smart cities to achieve long-term SDGs.

AB  - The Global Ecosystem and Environment Observation Analysis Research Cooperation (GEOARC) is an effort made by China to protect the global ecological environment and actively implement the 2030 sustainable development goals of the United Nations. This paper introduces the positioning and characteristics of GEOARC’s work, and reviews 18 annual reports published by GEOARC from 2012 to 2018 on three topics: typical elements of global ecological environment, global key area and global ecological environment hot issues. Among them, the theme of typical elements of global ecological environment is to monitor and analyze the temporal and spatial changes of typical global ecological environment elements such as vegetation, water body and wetland by means of remote sensing, so as to help global governance, protect the life community of “landscape, forest, field, Lake and grass” and protect the common future of the earth.

AB  - The increase in local consumption and the opening of formal business units called coffee bars in the city of Tijuana, Mexico, reveals significant business opportunities. These opportunities could benefit, as stated by the Mexican Coffee Association (2017), from the implementation of a business model based on the circular economy, with the aim of maximizing the positive impact in the region. These establishments, which represent one of the most dynamic commerce and gastronomy sectors, have not been sufficiently considered by current public policies or by the regulatory framework in terms of promoting sustainable development. In summary, there is a lack of greater impetus for activities such as recycling and the promotion of a culture of sustainability that has a positive impact on economic benefit. The objective of this research advance is to present the first findings and reflections on the cafeteria and coffee bar businesses supported by the circular economy to propose a sustainable business model for cafeterias and coffee bars in the city of Tijuana, B.C. With this, the opportunity arises to offer a roadmap that details mechanisms and characteristics so that the business units involved adopt strategies aimed at maximizing their positive environmental impact and fostering a culture of cooperation. This initiative could also increase business opportunities for the local business community, thus contributing to increasing economic complexity and economically benefiting both the local community and the entire related value chain in the region.

AB  - The rapid expansion of urbanization, coupled with inadequate stormwater management practices, has had a significant impact on natural water drainage processes, leading to urban floods in various parts of the world. In the context of climate change, it is expected that the problem will be further exacerbated by an increase in rainfall intensities globally. Consequently, addressing the adverse effects of improper stormwater management and tackling urban waterlogging have become critical concerns in the face of the global challenges associated with implementing sustainable development strategies. This paper explores the issue of urban floods and focuses on the design of a resilient stormwater management system that enhances urban resilience to climate risks. The project centers around the implementation of a demanding stormwater management infrastructure in the Al Lawzi area, which encompasses Bahrain's sole natural lake, “AI Lawzi Lake.” The lake serves as a collection point for stormwater runoff utilizing interconnected open channels and under-road culverts. The methodology involves conducting comprehensive hydrological and hydraulic assessments of the stormwater system to evaluate its capacity and identify any weaknesses. Additionally, an analysis of extreme rainfall scenarios is performed to examine the system's performance under climate change conditions and propose measures for optimizing its effectiveness. The findings of this study provide support for the government's efforts to mitigate floods in the area in alignment with Bahrain 2030's Vision and contribute to achieving a range of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

AB  - Building energy consumption is a crucial aspect of the construction industry, as it significantly impacts operational costs and environmental sustainability. This study investigates the spatial variations of cooling energy consumption in Egypt, enabling the identification of regions vulnerable to high energy demands. To this end, we utilize high-resolution typical meteorological year (TMY) data developed from the reanalysis ERA5 dataset. EnergyPlus was employed to simulate a small office building for 535 grid points representing populous regions in Egypt. The Sandia method was utilized to generate TMY data for the last 30 years (1991–2020). The results reveal that the demand for cooling energy in the southern regions could be almost 136 % higher than in the northern regions of Egypt. The temporal patterns reveal the adverse influence of climate change on the average cooling energy consumption, with the peak values in July and August. The deviation between the TMY-based and long-term energy consumption showed a good agreement in different grids, with R2 greater than 0.9 in all grids and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ranging between 12 and 32.2 %. Furthermore, the paired t-test results show no significant difference between energy consumption derived from TMY data and long-term data across 95% of the studied grid points in Egypt, indicating that TMY data effectively represents long-term energy consumption trends. The findings can inform energy-efficient building design strategies and policymakers on improving energy efficiency and reducing environmental impacts.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of grooved absorber tubes on the efficiency of solar flat plate collectors (SFPCs). Conducted in Vellore, India, it compares plain tubes (case 1) with grooved tubes (cases 2 and 3) using water and glycol-water mixtures. Results show that grooved tubes significantly improved efficiency, particularly with glycol-water mixtures. Efficiency increased by up to 12 % in transient flow conditions and by 8 %–20 % across various flow rates compared to plain tubes. A 5 % increase in solar radiation led to a 7 % rise in effectiveness. Heat removal factors ranged from 0.66 to 0.69 for water and 0.76–0.78 for glycol-water. Case 2 exhibited the highest efficiency under transient flow, while case 1 had the lowest under laminar flow conditions. These findings suggest that grooved tubes significantly enhance SFPC performance. Three machine learning approaches—AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Tweedie regression—were employed for model prediction, utilizing SHapley Additive exPlanations for interpretability. The AdaBoost model outperformed with an MAE of 0.0150, MSE of 0.0003, RMSE of 0.0175, and R2 of 0.8494. Key features identified by the model included groove pitch, ambient and glass plate temperatures, and solar radiation. These findings offer insights into enhancing SFPC efficiency through absorber unit adjustments.

Efficiency increased by up to 12 % in transient flow conditions and by 8 %–20 % across various flow rates compared to plain tubes. A 5 % increase in solar radiation led to a 7 % rise in effectiveness. Heat removal factors ranged from 0.66 to 0.69 for water and 0.76–0.78 for glycol-water. Case 2 exhibited the highest efficiency under transient flow, while case 1 had the lowest under laminar flow conditions. These findings suggest that grooved tubes significantly enhance SFPC performance. Three machine learning approaches—AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Tweedie regression—were employed for model prediction, utilizing SHapley Additive exPlanations for interpretability. The AdaBoost model outperformed with an MAE of 0.0150, MSE of 0.0003, RMSE of 0.0175, and R2 of 0.8494. Key features identified by the model included groove pitch, ambient and glass plate temperatures, and solar radiation. These findings offer insights into enhancing SFPC efficiency through absorber unit adjustments.

AB  - Residential demand response is one of the key enabling technologies which plays an important role in managing the load demand of prosumers. However, the load scheduling problem becomes quite challenging due to the involvement of dynamic parameters and renewable energy resources. This work has proposed a bi-level load scheduling mechanism with dynamic electricity pricing integrated with renewable energy and storage system to overcome this problem. The first level involves the formulation of load scheduling and optimization problems as optimal stopping problems with the objective of energy consumption and delay cost minimization. This problem involved the real-time electricity pricing signal, customers load scheduling priority, machine learning (ML) based forecasted load demand, and renewable & storage unit profiles, which is solved using mathematical programming with branch-and-cut & branch-and-bound algorithms. Since the first-level optimization problem is formulated as a stopping problem, the optimal time slots are obtained using a one-step lookahead rule to schedule the load with the ability to handle the uncertainties. The second level is used to further model the load scheduling problem through the dynamic electricity pricing signal. The cost minimization objective function is then solved using the genetic algorithm (GA), where the input parameters are obtained from the first-level optimization solution. Furthermore, the impact of load prioritization in terms of time factor and electricity price is also modeled to allow the end-users to control their load. Analytical and simulation results are conducted using solar-home electricity data, Ausgrid, AUS to validate the proposed model. Results show that the proposed model can handle uncertainties involved in the load scheduling process along with a cost-effective solution in terms of cost and discomfort reduction. Furthermore, the bi-level process ensures cost minimization with end-user satisfaction regarding the dynamic electricity price signal.

AB  - Energy consumption is now one of the most important issues for network carriers, since the majority of the energy needed for their operation is consumed in the wireless access and optical transport networks. The continuous growth in the wireless customers and traffic volumes and the consequent energy demand on modern carriers’ broadband infrastructures require reconsidering their energy efficiency, by starting from the formulation of new, more complete and representative network models that should become the foundations for modern energy-aware control plane architectures. Accordingly, this work presents a novel comprehensive energy model for next-generation wireless access-over-optical-transport networks characterized by hybrid power systems (i.e., multiple dynamically available power sources). The objective is to identify the energy-related information that need to be handled at the control plane layer to support energy-aware networking practices. Such information can be made available to suitable energy-aware routing and wavelength assignment algorithms that may exploit them to optimize the overall network energy-consumption and reducing the associated carbon footprint. The proposed model may be taken as a reference for the implementation of new energy-aware control plane protocols (routing and signaling) that make use of power-related considerations to achieve energy-efficiency and energy-awareness in wavelength-routed network infrastructures.

AB  - This work presents an experimental investigation of a two-phase looped thermosyphon design for cooling Air Circuit Breakers (ACBs) in switchgear used in data center power distribution systems. The FC72 charged thermosyphon is comprised of a bespoke evaporator that is fixed tightly to the copper adaptor of the ACB. Dielectric tubing connects the evaporator to a remote naturally aspirated and thin form factor condenser. Since both the working fluid and the connection tubing are dielectric, the thermosyphon provides electrical isolation between the ACB and the remote heat sink. The condenser is a thin serpentine channel with surface extensions and is cooled by natural convection and radiation to the ambient environment. Benchtop thermal performance tests were performed for increasing load power for two scenarios: for the stand-alone looped thermosyphon and for the case where copper bus bars are also fixed to the ACB adapter. For 60 W thermal power dissipation, a nominal operational condition, the thermal resistance of the looped thermosyphon system was determined to be 0.55 K/W without bus bars attached. With bus bars attached, this decreases to 0.42 K/W which results in a breaker to ambient temperature rise of about 25 K, which is significantly lower than operational limits of 85 K temperature rise. In-situ tests were then performed on a live ACB system carrying a 2000 A load and showed that the looped thermosyphon system was capable of decreasing the ambient temperature rise by 26 K, which is significant. The low thermal resistance of this passive cooling technology opens the opportunity for increased electrical service per breaker and/or a significant reduction in the volume of copper bus bars used with associated cost reduction of ACB technologies.

AB  - Deep learning models are widely employed to solve complex problems in different areas, particularly for image classification, because of their high performance in pattern recognition tasks. The demand for image classification extends beyond traditional computing environments and often requires deployment of embedded and low-cost devices in real-world scenarios to meet low-latency applications and user requirements. Embedding deep learning in low-cost devices is challenging due to their constrained resources, whereas deep learning models require many resources. In the literature, there are different approaches to make this embedding viable, such as reducing model complexity or improve system efficiency. Understanding these particularities is essential for proposing new low-cost model-embedding methods. Hence, this paper presents a systematic review of deep learning models for image classification using embedded devices. This review covers studies published between 2013 and 2023 and indexed in the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Scopus. Our analysis included 111 studies, and we categorized eligible papers based on various attributes from the deep learning models. The key contributions of this study include identifying prevalent trends, challenges, and advancements in the field as well as summarizing techniques that enable the deployment of high-performance models on resource-constrained devices. Our findings are expected to significantly benefit this area by pointing to the perspectives and challenges inherent in the use of low-cost devices for deep learning image applications.

AB  - We present a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) designed to improve the efficiency of Cloud Data Centers. The hardware part of the system consists of a number of dual functionality devices powered with scavenged thermal energy. The devices can perform two different functions: (i) act as wireless sensing nodes to monitor environmental parameters inside the server room that are important for system reliability and security; (ii) provide active cooling to the CPUs of the data center as smart heat-sinks. Starting from the empirical characterization of the energy harvesting module, we determine the amount of energy that can be harvested from a CPU heat dissipation while performing different tasks. We then analyze the amount of energy required to supply the low power sensors or to actuate the cooling fan. The CPS exploits a software simulator of the network of smart heat-sinks to predict the status of the devices. The simulator works in conjunction with a management algorithm used to administrate the cloud infrastructure and the network of smart heat-sinks for pursuing global objectives, i.e., maximizing the power efficiency of the data center, while keeping the wireless sensing network alive. Experimental data and simulation results of the framework validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Circular economy (CE) and sustainability are high on the political agenda of governments nationally and internationally. Governments are developing instruments to stimulate the CE, but without monitoring in place, these measures can be subject to abuse, failing to achieve the desired effects. CE monitoring, however, is still a nascent topic in academic literature. In this paper we propose the concept of the extended data pipeline to support CE visibility. Governments, but also banks and auditing firms can use this visibility to monitor CE flows to design and evaluate instruments and measures to enhance the CE.

AB  - The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have paved the way toward a more sustainable future. The 2019 EU Green Deal and the 2020 EU Circular Economy Action Plan [1] introduce laws and regulations to facilitate and encourage the transition towards sustainability and a circular economy (CE). For the implementation of these regulatory measures, public authorities face the challenge to gain access to relevant business data for compliance monitoring. Digital infrastructures and access to business data (sources) such as the material composition of products are useful for compliance monitoring, however CE-relevant data is spread across multiple platforms of the supply chain partners and across multiple supply chains. Therefore, digital infrastructures and information-sharing arrangements need to be developed to create visibility and traceability for monitoring the circular economy flows. In this paper, we use a conceptual framework with four dimensions (context, actors, public value, and digital infrastructures) to analyze key actors and potential data of value they hold in their digital infrastructures to explore options for data-sharing solutions. By focusing predominantly on the actor dimension, we analyze a case study in the automotive industry, taking the perspective of two focal Dutch governmental actors: Customs and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management. In our analysis, we also show how this actor dimension is linked to the other dimensions: context, public value, and digital infrastructures. These dimensions play an instrumental role in navigating through the complex actor-network in a systematic way toward identifying pathways for the development of digital infrastructures and data-sharing solutions for circular economy monitoring.

AB  - Circular economy (CE) and sustainability are high on the political agenda of governments nationally and internationally. We see different regulatory developments where governments aim to put stricter rules and requirements towards businesses to ensure the transition toward a more circular and sustainable future. The use of digital infrastructures, including transparency systems and digital product passports is starting to play a vital role in supporting governments in their CE monitoring efforts. Yet there are challenges to be overcome. Many government procedures are set up in laying out very detailed requirements about what one government agency can do in a singular phase of the circular process (e.g., customs performing specific checks at the border) or a single Member State (e.g., organizing Extended Producer Responsibility in a specific country). While these efforts are valuable building stones towards CE monitoring, they are fragmented, and blank spots in CE monitoring occur when borders are crossed, and another country needs to take over the CE monitoring tasks. As for circularity, even if many efforts are spent by a single government agency or a single country, all these efforts may be in vain if the proper CE monitoring of the next step is not secured. While earlier research identified this problem, there is still limited understanding of the problem itself and directions to address it systematically. In this paper, following up on earlier research and with insights gained from an EU project on CE monitoring, we shed further light on the problem. More specifically we conceptualize CE monitoring by putting the CE flows at the center and exploring deficiencies for governments and businesses to safeguard the monitoring of CE flows. We examine two routes that can be followed to ensure continued CE monitoring when borders are crossed, namely the government route, as well as the business route (enabled by traceability systems and in-control mechanisms of businesses). We discuss the need for a global governance layer that can facilitate both routes and propose further directions to advance CE monitoring by taking a global perspective.

AB  - The smart grid is a decent idea for improving energy efficiency, however its functionality requires frequent exchange and processing of household electricity consumption data. On the other hand, the exchange of high frequency household electricity consumption data may reveal private personal information such as when a person is at home, when she goes to bed, what time she wakes up and even which household appliances she uses. The privacy of this sensitive data should be protected even from the utility company. Furthermore, utility companies may consider outsourcing their smart grid data communication and processing tasks to the cloud to avoid the cost of investments on infrastructure. In such a scenario, protecting the privacy of sensitive user electricity consumption data, transmitted in a public network, would become even more critical. We address this issue by proposing a secret-sharing scheme that allows for private distribution and processing of user electricity consumption data in the cloud.

AB  - Many power utility companies around the world are moving towards smart grid, which integrates power delivery infrastructure with information and communication technologies. Smart meter is one of the main components of smart grid. The task of a smart meter is to track energy consumption of a premise and send that information to the utility company. Although the use of smart meter has many benefits, there are a number of security concerns regarding its usage. One particular concern is regarding the impacts of security and privacy breach of smart meter. This paper focuses on the financial impacts of smart meter security and privacy breach. The financial impacts discussed in this paper are derived from the impacts of security and privacy breach described in the literature. It is found out that the financial loss may involve various parties including the premise owner, the utility company, as well as the nation. The amount of loss can also go up to billions of dollars. Given the large group of people who may be involved and the large amount of money to be potentially lost should a security or privacy breach occur, it is very important for power companies to establish a security policy regarding smart meter and to allocate reasonable amount of resources to secure the deployed smart meter as well as the rest of the smart grid infrastructure.

AB  - Over the last 30 years, rising global temperatures due to climate change have led to changes in, and proximal to, urban and rural ecosystems. These changes have caused the patterns of transmission of infectious diseases by vectors, such as mosquitoes, to vary considerably. Diseases such as Dengue Fever, Malaria and Zika (caused by the Zika Virus) have re-emerged where they had disappeared, have become more pervasive in the areas they already existed, and have now emerged in cities where they were previously not seen. In order to combat this dangerous trend while meeting the targets set by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, public health officials in charge of urban and rural environments constantly have sought ways to reduce the risk from a disease outbreak. The TripleRM Global Health Management Model (GHMM) can be used for Disease Outbreak and Response in Urban and Rural Environments. It is designed for risk assessment, resilience building and resource management, and can be utilized to research the effectiveness of processes implemented in disease detection and response. The TripleRM Global Health Management Model (GHMM) can be used for reduction or elimination of risk to populations by identifying situational and process vulnerabilities and their impending effects, evaluating current public health controls in place, identifying effective solutions and remedial measures, and recommending a methodology for optimal resource allocation. The TripleRM Global Health Management Model (GHMM) incorporates remedial measures, strategic initiatives designed to integrate adaptability and resiliency, implement policy changes and update emergency response protocols.

AB  - Securing private data is the concern of every network user, especially if these users are patients who seek medical attention and constant vitals monitoring. So, a dedicated set of wearable devices that are connected wirelessly to a medical care institution are the simplest definition of a Wireless Body Area Network, which gives a patient the freedom of movement while certain organs are constantly monitored. Securing the system against attacks on data transmitted puts an overhead to the users and developers of these networks. A procedure called Practical Security Assessment is a technique used to set security measures to detect attacks on the network. Almost all security procedures add energy consumption of nodes in a network and some are not guaranteed to be efficient enough. In this research, PSA was tested and proven to minimize the increment in energy consumption over a defined distance between nodes to guarantee legitimate nodes are the only ones that are connected.

AB  - In the modern era, population and economic growth have accelerated urban sprawl in Saudi Arabia. This has placed tremendous pressure on the country’s natural resources, including water, energy, and raw materials. Hence, the conventional means of expanding the built environment is no longer appropriate, as it has been found to be one of major causes of climate change and global warming. In the early 1970s, the principles of sustainable development emerged in developed countries, in order to remedy this global issue. During this period, Saudi Arabia experienced dramatic development in all of its industries, but the principles of sustainable development were, to a large degree, overlooked. However, there is now an ambitious Vision 2030 for Saudi Arabia, one of the purposes of which is to promote greater sustainability in the country. This study seeks to assist decision makers to identify the challenges and opportunities of the current Saudi practices of city design, and their related operational aspects, and to enable the adoption of effective measures for implementing sustainable development principles. Employing an ethnographic research methodology, the fieldwork concerned includes a public perception survey, followed by a site inspection, in order to develop an insider’s view of the current level of sustainable practice in the city of Najran. A public survey is distributed to well-informed citizens, with the goal of obtaining their insights, and to assess their willingness to embrace green city practices. This is followed by a site inspection visit that seeks to obtain in-depth information regarding site design and operational practices. A checklist of sustainable criteria is adapted from well-known systems. The major outcomes of the study reveal that many challenges are encountered the application of green city principles.

AB  - EDSGN 100 is the cornerstone engineering design course at The Pennsylvania State University. During the second half of the spring 2020 semester, students across 19 sections of the course were presented with the same design prompt: how can you improve sustainability at Penn State and in the local communities? Throughout the course of the project, students were expected to view their identified sustainability challenge and proposed solution from a systems perspective. In developing and evaluating their designs, teams were expected to draw connections between the sustainability challenge they identified, the UN Sustainable Development Goals and other grand challenges, and climate change solutions posed by Drawdown. Further, teams were expected to explore the direct and indirect impacts of implementing their proposed design on society, the environment, and the economy.

AB  - Energy generation and its consequent environmental impact due to the resulting carbon footprint is in the forefront of global researches. The power poverty in Nigeria has immensely enabled Universities to embark on diesel-powered generators to provide the energy requirement for teaching, researches and community services. Hence, the campuses are becoming hotspots for emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, thereby contributing to global warming and environmental degradation. This study developed a management regime for carbon footprint in Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti (ABUAD), Nigeria. It audited the various activities and units that directly or indirectly promote green gases on the campus environment over a period of twelve months. The carbon footprint over the period was estimated to be 15,335,017.41 kgCO2e, with the bulk of the emissions (15,272,803.68 kgCO2e) coming from electricity generation and use. The data was modelled and analysed to arrive at veritable mitigation strategies

This paper focuses on the electrification of remote islanded community with renewable energy sources. This paper proposes two electrification schemes. In first scheme, the whole village is centrally electrified with the use of biodiesel generator, solar PV and with battery banks as storage. With the addition of renewable energy resources in the grid due to its intermittent nature causes fluctuations in frequency. The paper shows the design of frequency controller incorporated with battery to reduce frequency fluctuations. To investigate, a microgrid comprises of diesel generator, solar P.V as generating units with an external battery energy storage system as an ancillary service source to provide primary frequency response is modeled in MATLAB Simulink. In second scheme, a single phase decentralized design is proposed to electrify individual houses with solar and battery arrangement. To assess the effectiveness of the intended system, actual solar irradiance data and load profile of Pahadi village, Morena in Madhya Pradesh, India is taken into consideration.

AB  - The challenge of Nigeria’s food insecurity in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic, insecurity, climate change, population growth, food wastage, etc., is a demanding task. This study addresses Nigeria’s food insecurity challenges by adopting agriculture 4.0 and commercial farming. Using data from six digital libraries, the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics, and other internet sources, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR using PRISMA) on Nigeria’s agriculture, food security, and agriculture 4.0. Our results show Nigeria’s current agricultural state, threats to food security, and modern digital agriculture technologies. We adapted our SLR findings to develop an implementation framework for agriculture 4.0 in solving Nigeria’s food insecurity challenge in the post-Covid-19 era. Our proposed framework integrates precision agriculture in Nigeria’s food production and the necessary enabling digital technologies in the agri-food supply chain. We analyzed the critical implementation considerations during each agri-food supply chain stage of farming inputs, farming scale, farming approach, farming operation, food processing, food preservation/storage, distribution/logistics, and the final consumers. This study will help researchers, investors, and the government address food security in Nigeria. The implementation of agriculture 4.0 will substantially contribute to SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) of #Envision 2030 of the United Nations, for the benefit of Nigeria, Africa, and the entire world.

AB  - Energy consumption in the building sector accounts for a large percentage of global energy consumption. For this reason, it is essential to take action to minimize this destructive consumption and promote energy conservation practices within the building sector. A Zero Energy Building (ZEB) concept has been proven as a viable technique for improving energy efficiency in various climatic conditions. This concept can minimize the environmental impact of buildings and helping to advance sustainable development in the construction industry. Worldwide, the ZEB is of the utmost importance to meet sustainability development goals in the built environment. The building sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) consumes about 75% of total electrical energy. KSA has experienced an unprecedented energy consumption in the last decade. This is due to the country’s rapid population growth and urbanization, which in turn put more pressures on the kingdom’s natural resources. However, KSA is committed to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies to achieve the goals of sustainability development, as part of its Vision 2030. This paper therefore explores various green building solutions, especially in hot-arid regions, with the aim of reaching ZEB, and at the same time minimizing potential adverse environmental impacts. In order to verify proposed solutions, energy simulation software (Integrated Environmental Solution-IES) is used, along with reviews of related work. The major finding of this paper reveals that several green building concepts are crucial to the design and operation of a building in hot dry region, including thermal mass; daylight; natural ventilation; cavity wall; double-glazing and solar panels (PV). Bear in mind that the operation of a building has to be powered by a Building Management System (BMS). This paper also proposes an auxiliary holistic framework that explains how green practices such as Zero Energy Buildings (ZEBs) can be achievable in Saudi Arabia with no harm to its local environment.

AB  - Smart metering is a mechanism through which fine-grained electricity usage data of consumers is collected periodically in a smart grid. However, a growing concern in this regard is that the leakage of consumers' consumption data may reveal their daily life patterns as the state-of-the-art metering strategies lack adequate security and privacy measures. Many proposed solutions have demonstrated how the aggregated metering information can be transformed to obscure individual consumption patterns without affecting the intended semantics of smart grid operations. In this paper, we expose a complete break of such an existing privacy preserving metering scheme [10] by determining individual consumption patterns efficiently, thus compromising its privacy guarantees. The underlying methodol-ogy of this scheme allows us to - i) retrieve the lower bounds of the privacy parameters and ii) establish a relationship between the privacy preserved output readings and the initial input readings. Subsequently, we present a rigorous experimental validation of our proposed attacking methodology using real-life dataset to highlight its efficacy. In summary, the present paper queries: Is the Whole lesser than its Parts? for such privacy aware metering algorithms which attempt to reduce the information leakage of aggregated consumption patterns of the individuals.

AB  - Uganda's poor grid connectivity and high utility prices have forced its users to reduce appliance usage to save energy costs. In such a scenario, energy efficiency programs can greatly help end users to lower energy bills while increasing energy usage in appliances. The authors are providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD), Uganda, on the design of energy efficiency standards and labeling programs for residential refrigeration products in Uganda. Refrigeration appears to be the largest source of residential energy consumption in Uganda (~200 Gigawatt-hours per year) (GWh/year), which represents about 28% of the electricity consumption in the residential sector. Existing opportunities for energy efficiency in refrigerators can reduce per-unit energy use by as much as 60% in developing countries with unregulated markets dominated by inefficient refrigerators. The improved energy efficiency of refrigeration also contributes to achieving the United Nations sustainable development goals such as Climate Action and Access to Affordable and Clean Energy, which have been adopted by Uganda. The authors discuss the steps for creating a database of models sold in Uganda to estimate the baseline energy consumption of this equipment. They also present a literature review of the existing legal framework and administrative and enforcement capacities in Uganda and its neighboring countries, Rwanda and Kenya. Lessons learned from the neighboring countries will be used to address challenges in Uganda's existing legislative and administrative capabilities and to publish and enforce standards. The paper concludes by highlighting the role of these aspects in designing energy efficiency standards for residential refrigeration products in Uganda

AB  - Interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets play a significant role in modelling decision-making problems with incomplete information more accurately than intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Various decision-making methods have been introduced for the different classes IFSs. In this study, we aim to introduce a novel two-phase interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy dominance method which suits the decision-making problems modelled under the IVFFS environment well and study its applications in the adoption of energy consumption in Urban mobility considering digital carbon footprint. The proposed method considers the importance and performance of one alternative with respect to all others, which is not the case with many available decision-making algorithms introduced in the literature. Transportation is one of the most significant sources of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Numerous potential remedies are proposed to reduce the quantity of GHG generated by transportation activities, including regulatory measures and public transit digitalization initiatives. Decision-makers, however, should consider the digital carbon footprint of such projects. This study proposes three alternatives for reducing GHG emissions from transportation activities: incremental adoption of digital technologies to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gases, disruptive digitalization technologies in urban mobility, and redesign of urban mobility using regulatory approaches and economic instruments. The proposed novel two-phase interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy dominance method will be utilized to rank these alternative projects in order of advantage. First, the problem is converted into a multi-criterion group decision-making problem. Then a novel two-phase interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy dominance method is designed and developed to rank the alternatives. The importance and advantage of the proposed two-phase method over other existing methods are discussed by using sensitivity and comparative analysis. The results indicate that rethinking urban mobility through governmental policies and economic tools is the least advantageous choice, while incremental adoption of digital technologies is the most advantageous.

AB  - Despite being a big supplier of natural gas and petroleum, Nigeria routinely has unpredicted electricity supplies. Doing business in Nigeria is challenging due to the ineffective generation and distribution of power. In this way, Nigeria recognizes the value of clean and renewable energy sources in addressing its power shortage. Nigeria has also had a long history of utilizing renewable energy, particularly hydropower. Numerous studies were done to determine the worth of renewable energy as a compliment to provide Nigeria with the energy required for its national development. Without a doubt, renewable energy sources including Solar, wind, hydro and biomass can be added into Nigeria's higher proportion of fossil fuel-based energy sources to help fulfill demand and the growing interest in climate change around the world. Nigeria is lucky to possess an abundance renewable energy resources, which may boost the nation's energy production capacity and, in turn, assist industrialization and the creation of green jobs for the development of the country. Despite their availability, renewable energy sources are still not being fully used, which prevents them from making a significant contribution to the nation's electrical power output.

The time period under investigation covered monthly data from 2018, the year that Indonesia's first green sukuk was issued, to 2022. The study is enhanced by estimation using Granger causality and autoregressive distributed lag. The results show that while green stock and sukuk have a negative impact on climate change over the long term, lag-1 and lag-2 are significantly impacted negatively in the short term by green sukuk. In the short run, green stocks are beneficial. While the industrial production index has a negative short-term impact on climate change, it has a favorable long-term impact. This suggests that there has to be an increase in both the short- and long-term tenors of Indonesia's global green sukuk.

However, a clear division of topics within this field is found lacking. This study addresses this gap by examining the intersection of fashion and sustainability, assessing its evolution, characteristics, and potential research topics. The study aims to assess past literature on sustainability in fashion, ascertain research trends, and provide future research directions as well as implications. An exhaustive search was conducted using the comprehensive database of Scopus considering studies conducted before February 2023, the earliest study having been published in 1963. The resulting sample of 658 articles was analyzed using the topic modeling method of text mining in R software with latent Dirichlet allocation covering various studies on sustainable fashion from manufacturing to marketing. Results of the topic modeling analysis revealed that sustainable purchase intention and behavior are at the top of the research output. We present strategies and challenges for implementing a circular economy in the fashion sector. This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to apply a topic modeling approach to the examination of sustainable fashion literature. It offers a comprehensive and interdisciplinary assessment of this sustainable fashion research.

AB  - Several countries including South Africa have relied heavily on fossil fuels as their primary energy sources to develop their economies at the expense of the environment. With the country aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net zero emissions by 2050 an opportunity has been created for energy-intensive industries to phase out these energy sources and move to low-carbon renewable energy sources. Since energy generation is a major contributor to emissions, it has been found that the most effective way to implement decarbonization strategies is through target setting and tracking of energy usage. Most businesses, especially the intensive energy users and those publicly listed have thus been constantly tracking their emission levels through energy usage and efficiency to meet the 2030 targets and ultimately, the 2050 net zero emissions target. In this study, sustainability targets of the Top 100 listed companies by market capital on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) in South Africa have been reviewed to find the correlation between energy efficiency targets and their corporate sustainability goals. Of the 100 evaluated companies, 76 have energy efficiency targets and are deemed to be on track to achieve their GHG emission reduction targets. This target-setting and reporting approach has further assisted some companies in innovating their business practices without any major impact on their business operations.

AB  - The conventional paradigm in various industries, especially the agricultural sector, heavily relies on smart contracts for intricate transactions involving farmers, Village Cooperative units, distributors, and consumers. However, the current approach utilizes traditional transaction methods with intermediaries, leading to inefficiencies and potential security risks. Transparency and privacy issues persist in these transactions, exacerbated by delays and vulnerabilities introduced by intermediaries. In our innovative approach, present a novel system that leverages smart contracts as digitally signed cryptographic agreements, eliminating the necessity for intermediaries. Blockchain technology is harnessed to ensure transparent and secure data transactions, thereby elevating the efficiency of smart contracts. The system introduces decentralized data sharing, facilitating seamless tracking of supply chain activities. Specific agricultural transactions with Cooperatives serve as intermediaries our proposed system utilizes smart contracts as digital signatures to authorize transactions. Meticulous logging of activities ensures a traceable record of transaction origins. In our proposed system marks a paradigm shift in supply chain management by seamlessly integrating smart contracts and Blockchain technology. The transition from the existing system promises to revolutionize agricultural transactions, offering heightened transparency, security, and efficiency, thereby reshaping the landscape of supply chain management.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to examine the optimization of power supply and control techniques in Rubber-Tired Gantry (RTG) crane systems. A Simulink-based simulation model was developed to investigate the behavior of the RTG Crane system, with a focus on the interaction of the three primary motors, namely the hoist, trolley, and gantry motor. The study investigates power supply scenarios and control factors to give insights into how to improve power consumption savings, efficiency, sustainability, and performance of RTG Crane operations. Integration of alternate power sources, including improved battery storage systems, and optimization of control algorithms provide a diverse approach to addressing these modern difficulties. Our primary goal is to improve energy consumption in an RTG while keeping the three main motors' important responsibilities in view. This paper presents the proposed model and the result showed energy consumption savings.

AB  - Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are increasingly significant in modern cities due to their potential to reduce air pollution. Precise and real-time estimation of energy consumption is imperative for effective itinerary planning and optimizing vehicle systems, which can reduce driving range anxiety and decrease energy costs. As public awareness of data privacy increases, adopting approaches that safeguard data privacy in the context of BEV energy consumption modeling is crucial. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for mitigating the risk of exposing sensitive information to third parties by allowing local data to remain on devices and only sharing model updates with a central server. Our work investigates the potential of using FL methods, such as federated averaging (FedAvg) and federated personalization (FedPer), to improve BEV energy consumption prediction while maintaining user privacy. We conducted experiments using data from 10 BEVs under simulated real-world driving conditions. Our results demonstrate that the FedAvg long short-term memory (LSTM) model achieved a reduction of up to 67.84% in the mean absolute error (MAE) value of the prediction results. Furthermore, we explored various real-world scenarios and discussed how FL methods can be employed in those cases. Our findings show that FL methods can effectively improve the performance of BEV energy consumption prediction while maintaining user privacy.

AB  - Climate change is the defining challenge of our generation—and companies around the world are stepping up with ambitious net zero commitments. Designers are aggressively adopting strategies to assess product footprints and reduce the same during entire life cycle. While designing products, product attributes such as cost, performance, manufacturability, safety, and aesthetic are considered together. At each stage of the design cycle, solutions are evaluated and re-evaluated for technical, economic, and social objectives. In this paper, a methodology is discussed wherein sustainable design process is integrated across product development cycle. The process involves addressing material substances, energy efficiency, life-time extension, and recyclability to address commitment to net zero, reduction in impact on human health and on environment i.e., on land, air and water. One of the products under development was selected as a case study to assess and prove practicability. The method established help designers in the early development stage to validate carbon emission and ensure compliance with various environmental regulations, directives, and standards.

AB  - This study delves into the simultaneous exploration of the circular economy and Islamic moral economics to uncover how the circular economy can be integrated with Islamic moral economics. It examines the methodology and sources of Islamic moral economy, highlights the distinctions between Islamic economics and capitalist economy, and presents empirical evidence. The research reveals that Islamic moral economy and the circular economy are mutually supportive concepts that can collaborate towards establishing a more sustainable and equitable world. Specifically, Islamic moral economy and the circular economy can be linked through sustainable agriculture, efficient water usage, and fair trade. Hence, policymakers must prioritize the circular economy to positively influence environmental sustain ability within Islamic nations and globally. A socio-cultural setting grounded in shared beliefs and perspectives, where individuals can discover spiritual validation for practices like reducing, reusing, recovering, recycling, and refusing, as well as other principles of circularization, will offer them more profound motivation compared to the role of producers and consumers in a contemporary market-driven society.

AB  - This full paper on innovative practice reports a COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning) educational experience, based on the UNESCO's Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), designed to teach about water resource management, strengthen attitudes and values towards sustainable development, and develop intercultural competences in undergraduate students from Colombia and Chile. 60 third-year engineering students from Chile and 40 students who attend basic science courses to enter a medical career from Colombia were involved in the practice. The didactics were based on the main COIL's elements (icebreaker, collaborative task, and reflection), and introductory activities for cultural exchange, collaborative content production, and reflection through a learning log were implemented. The experience was developed around the analysis of severe hydric stress of two regions: Coquimbo (Chile) and La Guajira (Colombia). Attitudes and skills for interculturality, and socio-affective development goals were assessed. The results showed that the students understood the global nature of the problems and the urgency to address them through an ESG (environmental, social and governance) approach. In the socio-affective dimension, the students progressed from feeling fearful, shy, and frustrated, to feel motivated and sensitized towards the problem analyzed, and towards the experience of intercultural exchange. Additionally, they showed interest in reflecting and modifying their water consumption habits and becoming active agents of change. The experience left learnings about the key factors for successful COIL implementation, such as curricular and operational logistics, sociocultural differences, the nature of the topics discussed, and the type of didactics that should be used for authentic student involvement.

AB  - Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) is crucial in meteorology and agriculture for understanding plant-environment interactions. Its application as an indicator in agricultural practices notably advances Sustainable Development Goals such as Zero Hunger (SDG 2) and Climate Action (SDG 13). This research focuses on the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity and food security in the Nile River Basin (NRB), emphasizing the role of VPD, temperature, and precipitation. Utilizing Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) datasets from NEX-GDDP-CMIP6, the study analyzes key climatic variables that influence agricultural conditions. The study applies the Mann-Kendall test to evaluate VPD trends from 2000 to 2060 under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. The study's findings on the implications of rising VPD levels in the Nile River Basin (NRB), particularly under the SSP 5-8.5 scenario, highlight a critical challenge for the region's agricultural productivity and food security. The increased VPD, indicative of drier conditions, leads to a moisture deficit for crops, potentially reducing agricultural yields. This scenario poses a significant threat to food security, as lower crop yields can result in food shortages and higher food prices, adversely affecting vulnerable populations. The study underscores the necessity of integrating VPD insights into agricultural and water resource management strategies to uphold food security against climatic variations in support of the SDGs.

AB  - Drawing on the dynamic capability view and resource-based view, this study investigates the relationship among artificial intelligence (AI)-based partner relationship management, firm performance, and sustainable competitiveness concerning the climate management of business-to-business (B2B) firms. Throughout this investigation, the study additionally explored the impact of several other dimensions, including information communication technology capability, firm fit, and technological readiness, as fundamental requirements for the implementation of AI-based partner relationship management. The present study also investigates the relationship between firm partner engagement and firm information processing systems for climate management of B2B firms and their impact on achieving firm performance and sustainable competitiveness. A mixed-methods approach was employed that involves in-depth interviews with senior managers from a diverse set of B2B firms, and the proposed hypothesis model was evaluated by analysing the collected B2B data of 142 responses using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The findings of the study show that information communication technology capability and technological readiness play a significant role in improving the performance of AI-based partner relationship management. Furthermore, the implementation of AI-based partner relationship management in B2B firms would help partner engagement and information processing systems for climate management, leading to sustainable firm competitiveness. The outcomes of this study offer many implications for managers and practitioners in the B2B sector and suggest potential avenues for future research.

AB  - Industry 4.0 technologies have a high potential to improve the planning and execution of linear projects such as roads, bridges and railroads. These technologies can help reduce emissions, enhance operations' efficiency, and improve users' quality of life. Despite their potential to promote sustainability in smart cities, there is a lack of research focused on analysing their impact. Therefore, this paper aims to identify 4.0 technologies related to linear projects and examine their influence on smart cities' sustainable development. The research method involved four main stages: identification of 4.0 technologies in linear projects, questionnaire design and application, influence analysis, and factor analysis. A systematic literature review identified a set of 4.0 technologies that favour smart cities' sustainable development. Subsequently, 66 experts were consulted to determine which of these technologies have the most significant influence on smart cities' sustainable development, highlighting data analysis and management, intelligent traffic control systems, and artificial intelligence. This study makes three main contributions: (1) it identifies thirty-seven 4.0 technologies associated with linear projects that promote sustainable development in smart cities; (2) it characterises the 4.0 technologies with the most significant influence on the sustainability of smart cities; and (3) it proposes nine principal components into which interrelated 4.0 technologies that promote sustainable development can be grouped. This study provides valuable evidence for smart city managers and offers guidance for the efficient adoption of 4.0 technologies in linear projects.

AB  - Sensor networks offer tremendous benefits for the future as they have the potential to make life more convenient and safer. For instance, sensors can be used for climate control to reduce power consumption, for structures such as bridges to monitor the maintenance status, or for company badges to locate employees in order to increase productivity. However, the introduction of such ubiquitous computing to everyday life also raises privacy concerns. In this work the authors presented a public-key cryptography implementation for secure key exchange on low-end wireless devices using elliptic curves. The implementation is based on optimal extension fields (OEF) that are a special type of finite fields GF(p/sup m/). As for the platform, the authors chose a Chipcon CC1010 chip which is based on the 8051 architecture and that is especially suited for secure wireless applications as it has a built-in radio transceiver as well as a hardware DES engine. A secure end-to-end connection was established between the sensor and a base station in an acceptable time of 3 seconds without requiring cryptographic coprocessors.

AB  - This study addresses the critical gap in understanding how digital technology adoption effects supply chain resilience and agricultural productivity within China's evolving agrarian sector. While digital technologies promise transformative benefits, their specific impacts on key factors such as infrastructure, market access, government policies, and environmental conditions remain underexplored. Our research aims to uncover the interrelationships between Digital Technology Adoption Rates (DTAR), Agricultural Infrastructure (AI), Market Access (MA), Government Support (GS), and Environmental Factors (EF) to provide actionable insights for enhancing Agricultural Productivity (AP) and Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) in regional contexts. We employed SEM path analysis modeling to evaluate data from agricultural stakeholders across five Chinese provinces (Shaanxi, Sichuan, Anhui, Hubei, and Hunan), representing diverse age groups, farm sizes, and practices. The model assessed hypotheses linking DTAR, AI, MA, GS, and EF to AP and SCR, enabling a systematic assessment of direct and indirect effects. DTAR and AI emerged as pivotal drivers of AP (68% variance explained), which subsequently strengthened MA (73% variance) and SCR (62% variance). GS and EF were also critical, directly enhancing SCR and underscoring the role of policy and environmental stability. Regional disparities were evident: Shaanxi (24.95%), Sichuan (20.79%), and Hubei (19.75%) exhibited higher contributions, attributed to varying technology adoption rates, farm sizes, and production scales, signaling the need for region-specific digital strategies. This study is among the first to apply SEM in analyzing digital agriculture's role in supply chain resilience, offering a holistic framework that integrates technological, infrastructural, policy, and environmental dimensions. It advances theory by elucidating how digital integration mediates productivity and resilience, while practical contributions include targeted recommendations for scaling digital infrastructure and tailoring policies to regional conditions. Policymakers and stakeholders can leverage these insights to fortify supply chains against global and local disruptions, fostering sustainable agricultural transformation.

AB  - Energy conservation is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change. Laptops contribute significantly to energy consumption, emphasizing the need for improved energy efficiency. This paper explores the application of thermal imaging technology to enhance energy conservation in laptops. Thermal imaging provides valuable insights into heat distribution on the laptop’s surface, aiding in identifying areas of excessive energy consumption. By identifying areas of a laptop that generate excessive heat and implementing energy-efficient measures, energy consumption can be reduced, and the device’s lifespan can be extended. The study leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze thermal images. We collected the thermal images for the dataset using the FLIR E75 Thermal camera. Two methods of Region of Interest (ROI) extraction, contour-based thresholding, and Detectron2-based extraction are employed. Feature extraction includes statistical, texture, spatial, and energy features, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce dimensionality. K-means clustering categorizes data points based on reduced features, and performance metrics validate the effectiveness of the clustering methods. The study also computes energy dissipation from thermal images using the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. Results indicate that thermal imaging, coupled with advanced analysis techniques, holds promise for improving energy conservation in laptops.

AB  - The escalating costs of electricity, coupled with the urgent environmental challenges posed by fossil fuel consumption, underscore the necessity of transitioning to renewable energy sources (RES). Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES), which integrate resources such as solar, wind, and hydropower, offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy solutions that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mitigate environmental degradation, and alleviate financial burdens on consumers. Despite their potential, the deployment of HRES remains complex due to factors such as resource variability, multidimensional system architectures, and substantial net present costs. This study provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in HRES optimization, evaluating classical methods, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches, hybrid algorithms, and software-driven tools. The findings highlight the advantages of AI-based techniques, which demonstrate superior global optimization capabilities and reduced computational times, albeit with certain limitations. Hybrid algorithms, combining multiple optimization techniques, emerge as particularly effective for enhancing system efficiency and reliability. Optimization platforms like HOMER are also noted for their practical utility in facilitating HRES design through user-friendly interfaces. This analysis underscores the potential of optimized HRES configurations to contribute significantly to load management, reduce GHG emissions, and achieve cost savings, ultimately guiding readers in selecting the most suitable optimization strategies for various HRES applications.

Various RERs were used to derive desalination systems such as solar, wind, geothermal, etc. Reverse osmosis, multi-stage flash, and multi-effect distillation are the most used desalination technologies in connection with various RES. Some RES/desalination technologies combinations could be cost-efficient and reliable if appropriately designed. However, the unpredictable load demands and the intermittency nature of the RERs make designing such systems difficult. Various integrated scenarios are proposed in such systems, such as PV combinations with wind, battery energy storage systems, fuel cells, electrolyzers, etc. As a result, determining the optimum configuration using traditional methods is difficult. Implementing intelligent techniques that can integrate all working and design parameters involved in the various possible scenarios is critical for finding the optimal operating conditions. This work discusses and summarizes various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance RES-powered desalination systems. The implementation of various forecasting models, optimization algorithms, and control systems in designing and operating RER-powered desalination systems was analyzed. Finally, future research recommendations for further improving the current technology were included.

AB  - Microbreweries have greater production costs per litre of beer compared to large breweries, as well as higher carbon footprints. Due to the range of different retrofit technologies available and the different capacities and configurations of microbreweries, it is not always clear what retrofits will improve operations. Therefore, this work proposes a novel mixed-integer nonlinear programming decision-making tool to be used by any microbrewery, that determines the technoeconomic feasibility and sizing of energy efficiency-improving retrofits, including solar and wind power, battery storage, anaerobic digestion, boiler type selection, heat integration by heat storage, and carbon capture via dual-function materials. The model was demonstrated on a real UK microbrewery case study. The model gave an optimal configuration of a 10 m3 anaerobic digester, 30 solar panels outputting 380 W each, an 800 W wind turbine and a 2.3 m3 heat storage tank, reducing annual operating costs by 62.9 % and carbon dioxide emissions by 77.1 % with a payback period of 8 years. The tool is designed to be flexible for use by any microbrewery in any location with any brewing recipe and allow the owner(s) to develop more profitable and sustainable microbreweries. Tweetable abstract Microbreweries can implement mathematically optimised renewable energy, heat integration and anaerobic digestion to reduce operating costs by 62.9 % and carbon emissions by 77.1 %.

AB  - The continuous evolution of processors requires vendors to translate ever-growing transistor budgets into performance improvements, e.g., by including more functional units, memory controllers, input/output (I/O) interfaces, graphics processing units (GPUs), and caches. This trend also increases complexity, which cannot be fully hidden from the operating system (OS) or application domains. Issues likewhere to place threads if cores have different frequency ranges or architectures, orwhere to perform a task that might be hardware-accelerated cannot be decided on a hardware level. Moreover, performance improvements need to be achieved within a limited power envelope with energy efficiency as a first order design goal. Introduced power saving techniques, however, can contradict OS and applications performance assumptions. Several processor vendors offer heterogeneous processor architectures, such as ARM's big.LITTLE or Apple M1, combining high-performance and power-efficient cores. Intel's first such architecture, Alder Lake, integrates different core architectures and various accelerating components. This work presents an architecture overview of Alder Lake and an in-depth analysis of its power efficiency properties and techniques. For example, this includes frequency scaling of different components, idle states and their latencies, integrated energy measurement capabilities, and recently introduced processor feedback interfaces and OS integration.

AB  - Photovoltaic Thermal (PV/T) solar systems have the capacity to convert solar radiation into both electrical and thermal energy. Solar cells convert solar radiation into electricity, whereas solar thermal collectors gather excess energy and use it to heat cooling fluids and extract leftover heat from photovoltaic cells. Optimizing the design of the PV/T cooling system is critical for increasing overall system efficiency. This research describes a revolutionary AI approach for determining the ideal design for PV/T cooling systems. The suggested system has three major stages: data collection (DC), data preprocessing (DP), and prediction (PS). In the DC step, the collected data is preprocessed before being input into the suggested prediction model. The PS uses the Optimized Deep Neural Network (ODNN) to forecast water, air, and electrical efficiency. To improve the model's effectiveness, a new met-heuristic method, the Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO), is used in conjunction with the Deep Neural Network (DNN). The SCSO approach improves the DNN's hyperparameters to maximize prediction accuracy. The results show that ODNN outperforms in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2), with values of approximately 0.0075, 0.00251, and 0.9972, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed AI-driven approach in optimizing PV/T cooling system design. In addition to predicting water, air, and electricity efficiency, the proposed AI-driven approach in this study shows the capacity to optimize the operational efficiency of a system. When combining SCSO with DNN, it shows its effectiveness in dynamically adjusting hyperparameters, contributing to the robustness of the model across many scenarios. Furthermore, the study focuses on the optimized PV/T cooling system's possible real-world applications, emphasizing its role in supporting sustainable energy solutions and solving the developing issues of solar energy consumption. The results confirm the suggested AI system's versatility and reliability, positioning it as a promising tool for improving solar energy technologies.

AB  - The drastic change in climate augments the importance of clean energy consumption. Therefore, this paper examines how environmental regulations influence the utilization of clean energy under the moderation of governance measures. The 2-Steps System GMM is applied to 26 OECD countries’ data from 1996 to 2019 to analyze the relationship. Our analysis depicts that environmental regulations and GDP significantly enhance clean energy usage in OECD countries. Moreover, economic globalization insignificantly impacts clean energy consumption. On the contrary, financial development in OECD countries significantly leads to a decrease in the consumption of clean energy because renewable energy projects are long-term and more expensive than non-renewable energy generation projects. This paper further discovers that the majority of the governance measures significantly and positively moderate the connection of environmental regulations with clean energy consumption. Consequently, constructive governance measures facilitate the effective implementation of environmental regulations in OECD countries eventually increasing the consumption of clean energy instead of non-renewable energy. To reduce GHG emissions in the environment, the government should encourage the usage of clean energy in their respective countries. Therefore, policymakers promote the practice of clean energy consumption through stringent environmental regulations and effective governance measures.

The capability of Artificial intelligence (AI) for societal good and support to these three pillars is a matter of research importance. Drawing attention to literature on various AI frameworks for climate change and the dynamic capability theory, this study conducts a survey of managers working within their AI ecosystem of B2B firms. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling are used to test the reliability, validity, and fitness of the research model. This model illustrates how big data-based AI system can influence business performance due to climate change. Research findings reveals paths involving “big data based artificial intelligence system”, “climate change competency process (prediction competency, mitigation competency, adaptation competency)”, “climate competent decision-making,” and “firm performance”, are statistically significant. As a part of research validation, three business cases are studied that focus on the decision-making capability of business under an uncertain environment. This study justifies that climate competent decision-making is a critical skill for businesses operating under uncertain environmental changes. This research brings out management perceptions generated due to climate change and discusses how they influence managers' behaviors that alter relationship dynamics and structure.

The novelty of this study lies in integrating hybrid renewable energy and AI-based hydrogen production optimization, a perspective not extensively covered in previous research. Furthermore, it presents a comprehensive analysis of AI applications, including predictive maintenance and fault detection, to improve hydrogen system reliability. A prominent contribution of this study is its focus on real-world case studies of hydrogen production and application, demonstrating its viability across transportation, power generation, and industrial sectors. By addressing key technical and economic challenges, this review outlines a scalable strategy for affordable and sustainable H2 production, encouraging a more resilient and sustainable energy future

AB  - Summary Gastrointestinal practices, especially endoscopy, have a substantial environmental impact, marked by notable greenhouse gas emissions and waste generation. As the world struggles with climate change, there emerges a pressing need to re-evaluate and reform the environmental footprint within gastrointestinal medicine. The challenge lies in finding a harmonious balance between ensuring clinical effectiveness and upholding environmental responsibility. This task involves recognising that the most significant reduction in the carbon footprint of endoscopy is achieved by avoiding unnecessary procedures; addressing the use of single-use endoscopes and accessories; and extending beyond the procedural suites to include clinics, virtual care, and conferences, among other aspects of gastrointestinal practice. The emerging digital realm in health care is crucial, given the potential environmental advantages of virtual gastroenterological care. Through an in-depth analysis, this review presents a path towards sustainable gastrointestinal practices, emphasising integrated strategies that prioritise both patient care and environmental stewardship.

AB  - The United Nations launched the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to address a multitude of complex challenges facing today's world. Concurrently, the concept of smart cities has evolved to embrace advanced digital technologies and artificial intelligence for urban management and sustainability. Within this context, the Metaverse has emerged as a virtual extension of smart cities, offering a revolutionary space to reimagine urban life and governance. This systematic review explores how the Metaverse, as a virtual form of smart cities, aligns with the SDGs. It focuses on identifying potential co-benefits and trade-offs between the Metaverse and SDGs. The results indicate that research primarily focuses on SDGs related to health, education, innovation, sustainable cities, and responsible consumption and production. In contrast, less attention is given to SDGs related to reducing inequalities, climate change, environmental sustainability, peace, and partnership. The synthesis highlights the potential of the Metaverse to enhance smart cities' operational efficiency, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making through big data analytics and virtual collaboration. However, it also identifies risks such as exacerbating disparities and increasing environmental burdens. While the Metaverse can offer transformative solutions for smart urban environments, its benefits must be balanced with equitable access and environmental sustainability to effectively contribute to the SDGs. This requires addressing the digital and technological divide and environmental concerns to foster inclusive urban societies that uphold peace, justice, and strong institutions. The review underscores the need for strategic policy frameworks to mitigate risks and maximize the positive impact of the Metaverse on sustainable and resilient urban development.

AB  - This study investigated the potential of integrating separate heat pipe and adsorption refrigeration systems as a data center efficient cooling system. Compared to water-cooled data centers, this approach demonstrates improved heat transfer efficiency and reduced energy consumption. The effectiveness of heat transfer in this approach is illustrated by applying exergy and entranspy theories. By conducting numerical simulations across five representative Chinese cities with different climates, both Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and key cooling system performance indicators are assessed. The analysis reveals that all cities can achieve a PUE below 1.095, realized a 65.87 % and 13.60 % reduction in cooling system energy consumption and entransy dissipation, respectively. Data centers using mechanical chiller cooling cause a high energy consumption. This paper indicates the benefits of integrating heat pipe and adsorption refrigeration systems in reducing energy consumption and optimizing overall data center performance.

AB  - As the global population and economy grow, so does the energy demand. Over-reliance on non-renewable resources leads to depletion and price spikes, making renewable alternatives necessary. Biodiesel is an eco-friendly and non-toxic fuel that closely resembles traditional fossil fuels. It is produced from various sources, including animal fat, palm oil, and non-edible plant oil. Biodiesel releases fewer harmful air pollutants and greenhouse gases than fossil fuels and is simpler to manage. Despite these advantages, it cannot replace traditional diesel fuel on a large scale. This overview summarizes biodiesel production, explaining the different types of feedstock utilized and their benefits and drawbacks. Various biodiesel production methodologies are discussed. The primary objective of this article is to inform engineers, industrialists, and researchers involved in waste biodiesel, as well as to highlight waste biodiesel as a potential substitute for fossil fuels. This review article discusses the nano-additives in biodiesel and applications of internet of things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning in biofuel. This review shows that nano-additives can potentially improve biodiesel fuel properties, favorable economic and policy environments promoting biodiesel production, and internet of things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning technologies optimize the biodiesel production processes. These advances can help promote biodiesel as a cleaner, renewable energy source, lowering the consumption of fossil fuels. It also suggests further biofuel development by improving efficiency, expanding feedstock options, creating policy support, developing infrastructure, and increasing public awareness.

AB  - A method for optimizing the combustion in an ultra-supercritical boiler is developed and evaluated in a 660 MWe ultra-supercritical coal fired power plant. In this method, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models are established for predicting the boiler operating and emission properties. To enhance the generalization of the ANN models, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is performed to generate some data as training samples for ANN modeling, together with the historical operating data. The inputs of the ANN models are unit load, coal properties, excess air and air distribution scheme, and the outputs are thermal efficiency and NOx emission. Based on the ANN models, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the air distribution scheme to achieve a higher thermal efficiency and lower NOx emission simultaneously. The predictions of the thermal efficiency and NOx emissions show a good agreement with the plant data, with mean errors of 0.04% and 3.56 mg/Nm3, respectively. The results indicate that the use of CFD data can help generalize the ANN models. The application to a practical plant demonstrates that the proposed approach provides an effective tool for multi-objective optimization of pulverized-coal boiler performance with improved thermal efficiency and NOx emission control.

AB  - Excessive food intake is significantly contributing to the rising rates of obesity and overweight in China, creating substantial financial and environmental challenges for the healthcare system. This study employs a cost of illness method combined with environmentally extended input-output analysis to assess the carbon footprint associated with obesity and overweight within China's healthcare sector. In 2020, healthcare expenditures related to obesity and overweight reached approximately 324.7 billion Chinese Yuan (CNY), resulting in emissions of 31.5 Mt. CO2e, which accounted for around 4.5 % of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the national healthcare sector. These emissions nearly negate the progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in China's service sectors. The carbon intensity of the healthcare sector related to obesity and overweight is higher than that of the general medical sector, emphasizing the urgent need for more targeted and effective intervention measures. This study represents an initial effort to quantify the healthcare carbon footprint related to obesity and overweight, providing crucial insights into the potential resource and environmental savings achievable by addressing these issues. It highlights the necessity of understanding of the impact correlated to overweight and obesity, offering valuable perspectives for tackling the global challenges of obesity and climate change.

AB  - The energy consumption of High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, which are the key technology for many modern computation-intensive applications, is rapidly increasing in parallel with their performance improvements. This increase leads HPC data centers to focus on three major challenges: the reduction of overall environmental impacts, which is driven by policy makers; the reduction of operating costs, which are increasing due to rising system density and electrical energy costs; and the 20 MW power consumption boundary for Exascale computing systems, which represent the next thousandfold increase in computing capability beyond the currently existing petascale systems. Energy efficiency improvements will play a major part in addressing these challenges. This paper presents a toolset, called Power Data Aggregation Monitor (PowerDAM), which collects and evaluates data from all aspects of the HPC data center (e.g. environmental information, site infrastructure, information technology systems, resource management systems, and applications). The aim of PowerDAM is not to improve the HPC data center's energy efficiency, but is to collect energy relevant data for analysis without which energy efficiency improvements would be non-trivial and incomplete. Thus, PowerDAM represents a first step towards a truly unified energy efficiency evaluation toolset needed for improving the overall energy efficiency of HPC data centers.

Both manufacturers produce substitutable products and bear the product recycling cost with (dis-) economies of scale. Based on the IPR system, we first study the impact of product competition, the scale effect of recycling, and the government recycling subsidy policy on the vertical channel structure selection strategies and selection equilibrium of the competing supply chains. Subsequently, we reveal how to design government subsidy policy with symmetrical supply chain structure combinations in order to achieve maximal social welfare.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) in soybean research has revolutionized various crop improvement and production aspects. This review provides predominant areas that have seen the use of AI. AI applications in phenomics have enabled collecting and analyzing high-dimensional data in soybean plants, from below- to above-ground traits, predicting phenotypes, and identifying complex patterns. In genomics, AI has improved genomic selection accuracy and identified genomic regions associated with traits of interest, such as resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. AI has also been extensively used in detecting and managing biotic and abiotic plant stresses using RGB, multispectral, and thermal imagery from ground-based and aerial platforms. Additionally, AI has shown significant potential in yield prediction, incorporating factors such as vegetation indices, weather data, and soil properties. This review explains the concept of cyber-agricultural systems (CAS) that integrates AI, advanced sensing, computational modeling, and scalable cyberinfrastructure to optimize soybean production, enhance resource management, reduce environmental impact, and improve farm efficiency. We explain the use of CAS in crop improvement as well. We provide an exhaustive listing of challenges and future direction in the integration of AI in soybean production and crop improvement, including multi-modal and layered sensing, data availability and quality, computational modeling, AI models and tools, Cyberinfrastructure, Explainability and interpretability of AI models, AI-related impacts on privacy, ethics, and policy, Impact on Smallholder Farmers, Digital Twin, Large Soybean Datasets for community usage, and Immersive environments.

AB  - Building Automation Systems (BAS) are widely used to enhance energy efficiency in buildings. Due to rigid control mechanisms, conventional BAS lacks adaptability and real-time responsiveness. Integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with BAS empowers real-time monitoring, data-driven automation, and smart decision-making. This advancement greatly improves energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and Carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction, which are critical factors for sustainable and smart buildings. However, existing studies lack analysis of these critical factors in a unified framework. Hence, this research reviews the 117 articles released from 2010 to 2023 to examine the nexus between IoT and BAS considering these factors. Moreover, this study systematically evaluates the IoT-driven BAS in three critical areas: energy efficiency, indoor user comfort, and CO2 reduction in smart buildings. Additionally, it addresses the key challenges in implementing IoT-BAS concerning interoperability, security, and scalability. The findings of this research unveil that IoT-BAS greatly improves energy efficiency, human comfort, and emission reduction through continuous monitoring, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation. The IoT-driven techniques like occupancy-based Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control, smart lighting, and predictive maintenance greatly minimize energy usage while enhancing indoor environmental quality. Furthermore, this study identifies standardized communication protocols, strong security frameworks, and hybrid cloud-edge architectures as efficient remedies aiding the IoT-BAS integration. This unique, challenge-driven research framework provides valuable insights to building engineers, facility managers, and policymakers advancing IoT-driven smart buildings while supporting sustainability goals. Future research should focus on AI-driven BAS, open interoperability, blockchain-based advanced cybersecurity, and digital twins for highly resilient IoT-BAS.

AB  - Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading has emerged as a practical solution for efficient energy management, particularly with the rising affordability of renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs). This paper introduces the Optimal Power Artificial Intelligence (OptiPower AI) algorithm, a significant advancement in Intelligent Cluster Energy Management (ICEM). OptiPower AI combines Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, and P2P energy trading to optimize energy distribution among clusters of prosumers and consumers. The system efficiently manages Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and EVs, achieving a 19.18% reduction in energy costs and a 50.02% decrease in average energy prices across V2X and P2P scenarios. OptiPower AI uses DRL to dynamically allocate energy and implement real-time pricing, enhancing energy efficiency and user satisfaction. Simulations based on meteorological data from Tunisia validate the system’s ability to improve thermal comfort, increase energy savings, and lower costs. The model’s parameters enable accurate forecasting and allocation, showcasing OptiPower AI’s reliability in variable demand conditions. This work advances the application of DRL in decentralized, sustainable P2P energy management systems for industrial clusters, addressing critical challenges in energy distribution, efficiency, and cost reduction.

AB  - Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), i.e. drones, have become a key enabler technology of many reconnaissance applications in different fields, such as military, maritime, and transportation. UAVs offer several benefits, such as affordability and flexibility in deployment. However, their limited flight time due to energy consumption is one of the key limitations. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that UAVs can complete the mission while consuming the least energy possible. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for UAV smart navigation to minimize the time and energy of planning mobile targets visitation. We develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to allow the drone to learn the targets’ mobility pattern and build its least energy scanning strategy accordingly. We conduct an initial evaluation of the system and our proposed DRL model policy using simulation. Then, to overcome the time-consuming exploration phase of DRL, we develop a Digital Twin (DT) environment of 3D physics-based simulator, which can be used to train the DRL agent efficiently. We also developed a testbed based on hardware integration with the parrot ANAFI drone to verify the feasibility of the proposed methodology. Our findings confirm that the DRL-based agent can achieve performance close to that of a benchmark policy. Moreover, the testbed experiment validates the practicality of utilizing the DT environment for DRL exploration.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) represents an important evolution in computer science and data processing systems which can be used in order to enhance almost every technology-enabled service, products, and industrial applications. A subfield of artificial intelligence and computer science is named machine learning which focuses on using data and algorithms to simulate learning process of machines and enhance the accuracy of the systems. Machine learning systems can be applied to the cutting forces and cutting tool wear prediction in CNC machine tools in order to increase cutting tool life during machining operations. Optimized machining parameters of CNC machining operations can be obtained by using the advanced machine learning systems in order to increase efficiency during part manufacturing processes. Moreover, surface quality of machined components can be predicted and improved using advanced machine learning systems to improve the quality of machined parts. In order to analyze and minimize power usage during CNC machining operations, machine learning is applied to prediction techniques of energy consumption of CNC machine tools. In this paper, applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems in CNC machine tools is reviewed and future research works are also recommended to present an overview of current research on machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches in CNC machining processes. As a result, the research filed can be moved forward by reviewing and analysing recent achievements in published papers to offer innovative concepts and approaches in applications of artificial Intelligence and machine learning in CNC machine tools.

AB  - In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the trade-off between the performance of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and their environmental impact. In particular, we compared 18 popular recommendation algorithms in terms of both performance metrics (i.e., accuracy and diversity of the recommendations) as well as in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint on three different datasets. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the algorithms were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. The outcomes of the experiments showed that the choice of the optimal recommendation algorithm requires a thorough analysis, since more sophisticated algorithms often led to tiny improvements at the cost of an exponential increase of carbon emissions. Through this paper, we aim to shed light on the problem of carbon footprint and energy consumption of recommender systems, and we make the first step towards the development of sustainability-aware recommendation algorithms.

AB  - This work investigates the path toward green recommender systems by examining the impact of data reduction on both model performance and carbon footprint. In the pursuit of developing energy-efficient recommender systems, we investigated whether and how reducing the training data impacts the performances of several representative recommendation models. In order to obtain a fair comparison, all the models were run based on the implementations available in a popular recommendation library, i.e., RecBole, and used the same experimental settings. Results indicate that: (a) data reduction can be a promising strategy to make recommender systems more sustainable, at the cost of a lower accuracy; (b) training recommender systems with less data makes the suggestions more diverse and less biased. Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the development of recommendation models that meet the principles of SDGs, laying the groundwork for the adoption of more sustainable practices in the field.

AB  - The rising global demand for Nile tilapia necessitates innovative production strategies to address food security challenges and drive economic growth in aquaculture. Optimizing tilapia yields, especially in earthen ponds, is crucial but often hindered by inefficiencies like overfeeding and suboptimal stocking densities, escalating costs and environmental concerns. Traditional aquaculture approaches frequently fail to balance operational expenditures, environmental sustainability, and fish health due to an overreliance on single-factor analyses, overlooking the complex interplay between multiple variables. This study introduces a novel multi-objective optimization approach by integrating the Design of Experiments (DOE) method with the Adaptive Artificial Multiple Intelligence System (AAMIS) to optimize aquaculture parameters. The Taguchi DOE method efficiently designs experiments by selecting essential variables and their levels. Multi-objective regression models developed using statistical software and fine-tuned by AAMIS, balance maximizing yield with minimizing costs. Computational analysis validates AAMIS's superior performance, achieving leading Hypervolume and Average Ratio of Pareto Optimal Solutions scores, surpassing traditional and advanced methods. AAMIS reduces life cycle costs to $39,880 and achieves the lowest environmental impact score of 3460.76, setting new benchmarks for sustainable aquaculture practices. This approach demonstrates broad applicability across diverse aquaculture systems, promising global improvements in sustainability and efficiency.

AB  - This article advances a qualitative scenario methodology involving comic-strip representations of digital technology and energy industry imaginaries in everyday life situations to reveal and ultimately disrupt their embedded narratives and assumptions. Six comic-strip scenarios were developed from a qualitative content analysis of 64 industry reports from the energy and digital technology (including artificial intelligence, automation, smart home technology and virtual reality) sectors. The scenarios consider digital and energy futures in relation to household social practice domains, such as working and studying, caring, or heating and cooling, where the majority of energy consumption takes place. The article contributes a methodological approach that allows social scientists to explore complementary and competing industry imaginaries within a particular area such as the home. It simultaneously reveals how this playful method can productively disrupt these imaginaries, laying the path to advance alternative futures. We conclude that energy imaginaries need to be urgently revised to take digital technology imaginaries into account, and to be grounded in the unfolding and dynamic changes to everyday life. We outline our plans to further explore the future scenarios, including as part of industry conversations and presentations, as speculative probes in ethnographic research, and in research or teaching.

AB  - With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), built environment (BE) is getting more and more closely linked to energy. A macroscopic view of smart energy (SE) and smart built environment (SBE) is provided in this paper. Categories of smart energy systems (SESs) are divided according to the trade forms. Objectives of SBE include minimizing non-renewable energy to maintain sustainable BE, minimizing carbon exhausted to guarantee green BE, and minimizing capital cost to provide economically affordable BE. The transient fraction of power (FP) in SESs has to be controlled to obtain the optimal fraction of energy (FE). The optimal FE values depend not only on system size and time scales but also on SBE objectives. A weighted maximum volume criterion is proposed to take sustainability, green, and affordability into account. Results are compared with those optimization results based on a single objective. Methodologies for promotion of SESs from technology, system optimization, demand forecasting, and holistic design views are presented. The corresponding solution for SBE is illustrated. Challenges for future SESs for SBE are also discussed.

AB  - The provision of digital infrastructure and affordable energy for households is an important direction for improving the living conditions of the population. The link between digital infrastructure development and affordable energy should be examined if multiple sustainable development goals are to be achieved simultaneously for the residential sector. This study employs a staggered difference-in-differences model to investigate the effect of digital infrastructure development on household energy consumption expenditure (HECE) by using the Broadband China Strategy as an example. The results indicate that: (1) The digital infrastructure development significantly reduced HECE; (2) digital infrastructure development significantly increased HECE as a share of total consumption, but did not have a significant effect on its share in subsistence consumption. Potential channel analysis shows that: (3) household per capita and subsistence consumption expenditure generate scale effects, and communication expenditure in developmental consumption expenditure generate complementary effects. Further heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that: (4) digital infrastructure development significantly reduced HECE of rural and fixed registration residents, and optimizes HECE and the share of subsistence consumption expenditures of residents with medium levels of consumption more significantly. The findings of this paper demonstrate the important role of improving digital infrastructure development in developing countries, especially in non-urban areas, which increases access to affordable energy for the general population and synchronize the achievement of multiple sustainable development goals.

AB  - The research objective is to create a mechanism that generates a valid 'sustainability' metric to enable prospective buyers to confidently identify low carbon footprint computers. The necessity is based upon the hypothesis that current product carbon footprint reports for computers are incomparable between brands. While the inconsistency of use-phase emissions has been addressed in prior associated research, supply chain emissions remain an issue. This is due to multiple scope 3 life cycle assessment methodologies being used by manufacturers that produce differing results even when applied to the same device. To test the theory and generate an alternative approach, the research analyses 244 notebook carbon footprint reports to show inconsistencies caused by five different methodologies. Based on the findings, an alternative approach to comparing supply chain impact is proposed that enables comparison between results. The new metric first generates an average scope 3 carbon footprint baseline value by device type (e.g. notebook). This is then reduced by specific values depending upon actions undertaken by manufacturers when calculating their original carbon footprint report. This includes deductions to the baseline value achieved by including high percentages of production and transport primary data, plus the availability and affordability of offerings that will extend device useful life spans to drive demand displacement. This includes warranty duration and cost plus ease of repair. The research finds that current methodologies create a range of inconsistency of +106% when used to calculate the carbon footprint of the same device and +142% when calculating similar device types. Therefore, the hypothesis of scope 3 emissions being incomparable is validated. Comparatively, the newly proposed mechanism shows a reduced range of inconsistency of 18% when demonstrated. As such, it is recommended that the new approach be applied to the latest version of the world's leading computer eco-label certification, TCO Certified version 10, in 2024. Doing so will enable organisations to confidently select low carbon footprint devices on a global scale and therefore meaningfully support the United Nations sustainable development goals of responsible consumption and production and ultimately climate action.

AB  - Wireless communication is widely used in Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) to facilitate data transmission, device programming, and real time monitoring. However, wireless systems are easy targets for attackers to inspect and potentially breach. Thus, security and privacy have become principal design requirements for IMDs. The challenge in secure IMD design stems from the conflicting constraints of the IMD (e.g. Utility, safety, privacy, security, size, and low power). In this paper, we propose a new ultra low power approach for non-invasive and secure communication and operation of IMDs. We exploit the inherent process variations in an FPGA's SRAM cells to create a unique and random input-output mapping, which we then match in an ASIC design, thus, creating two matched digital physical unclonable functions (PUFs). The smaller design is embedded with the IMD while the FPGA remains with the programmer (e.g. Doctor). We present our architecture, introduce accompanying protocols for secure cryptographic communication and trusted remote computation, and provide an analysis of the system's resilience to various security attacks. Our system is the first hardware-based digital security system proposed for IMDs. It is orders of magnitude lower in delay and energy consumption that traditional cryptographic techniques.

AB  - The carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals bring a rapid expansion of renewable energies, such as photovoltaic power and wind power. However, the output power of renewable energies is intermittent which may bring frequency deviation problems. The regulation ability of traditional generators may be insufficient to handle the frequency deviations since the great scale of renewable energies is replacing traditional power generators. With the development of communication technologies, demand response acquires more attention. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are suitable for demand response because they occupy a large portion of energy consumption and have huge regulation potential. Moreover, HVAC systems’ power consumption is flexible and adjustable by using the thermal storage feature of the buildings. When turning off the air conditioner or adjusting the set temperature, customers’ comfortable indoor temperatures can be maintained. However, considering the complexity and large scale of the power system, most previous studies on HVACs’ frequency regulation are verified only by simulation tools, e.g., MATLAB and Simulink. This study investigates the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) towards frequency regulation service by HVACs with RTDS. The HIL platform is implemented in the case of frequency regulation in a high photovoltaic power penetrated campus grid. The scenario is designed with a building thermal model based on the quantized architecture characteristic parameter which is considered the part of HVAC operation model.

AB  - Our research objective is to examine the impact of aerial tree inspections with micro-aerial vehicles (in short: micro drones) on students' climate education. Climate change threatens the health and survival of trees and forests. Aerial tree inspections represent an important climate change education approach to explain the urgency of climate change adaptation and climate solutions to draw down greenhouse gases. They are also useful tools to appreciate the technical components of micro drones such as external proximity sensors for obstacle avoidance, the fully enclosed propulsion system that allows flight inside dense jungle canopy or the macro-focused high-definition video feed with onboard 10W illumination so that dark areas can be inspected. With such a system, arborists no longer need to manually climb and scale trees. Our research goal is to examine the impact of climate education with micro-aerial vehicles for tree inspections on achieving important learning outcomes such as catalyzing students' climate change awareness and action. We regard micro drones as quality climate change teaching & learning tools that can improve students' engagement with climate change and increase their capacity to adapt to climate change by enhancing sustainability-related competencies and motivating them towards more pro-environmental, carbon offsetting behavior in the context of climate action.

AB  - This study highlights the concrete effects of worldwide warming on our environment while offering a brief introduction to green technology (GT) in the fourth industrial century (IR 4.0). The urgent need to move toward sustainable lifestyles and behaviors is clear, particularly in light of the currently catastrophic COVID-19 epidemic that has had a significant impact on social, economic, and environmental aspects. In order to get through this crisis, a shift to sustainable, green technologies is essential. This means implementing Internet of Things (IoT) approaches and Green Creative Technologies (GIT) to encourage the creation of long-lasting, biodegradable, and environmentally friendly products, which will help ensure a sustainable future. Green chemical engineering and environmental biotechnology are two particularly important pillars in the quest for sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals, set by the United Nations, (SDGs) are largely achieved thanks to the growing use of materials made from plants for pollution separation and improvements in product development for the creation of ecologically benign products. This coordinated effort supports the main objective of attaining IR 4.0, which is to create a more balanced and environmentally friendly environment for future generations. To sum up, in order to effectively address the issues presented by the effects of climate change and realize the goals of Industry 4.0, convergence of environmentally conscious technology, Internet of Things solutions, and cooperative methods between companies and governments is critical. The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) continue to be a major component of our collective progress toward a fair and ecologically responsible future.

AB  - Climate change is a global threat to agriculture, especially in Nigeria, which includes rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall, droughts, and extreme weather events. Nigeria, as a predominantly agrarian country, is dealing with complex climate change impacts that affect food, employment, and income. Using data from the General Household Survey Panel and a two-stage probability sampling method, this study investigates the vulnerability and transitions of 3,078 arable crop farm households across Nigeria. The study divides farm households into transition groups using descriptive statistics and used the Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) to assess climate change vulnerability, revealing that more than half (56.76%) are chronically vulnerable to climate change. Access to extension services and irrigation equipment are two factors that influence vulnerability transitions. The study emphasized the dynamic nature of vulnerability, with households shifting from low to high vulnerability over time. Recommendations emphasize the importance of national initiatives to revitalize extension services, especially in the vulnerable northern region. Subsidies for irrigation equipment are seen as critical for increasing crop production in the face of population growth and climate change. It was suggested that crop farmers can engage in nonfarm activities to increase their financial resilience. The study highlights the northern region's pronounced vulnerability, which is influenced by education levels and household size. It proposes policy interventions to address these vulnerabilities, as well as insights into effective climate change mitigation strategies for Nigeria's arable crop farming sector.

AB  - This research paper explores the challenges and opportunities for improving livelihoods (SDG8) through sustainable agriculture (SDG2) and clean energy (SDG7) in Sadivayal Village, Tamil Nadu, India. Utilizing Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and Human-Centered Design (HCD) methodologies, the study identifies critical issues such as unpredictable rainfall, inadequate water management, and reliance on water-intensive crops such as rice varieties, maize, and other grains. By analysing rainfall data from 2018 to 2022 highlights the urgent need for innovative water storage and alternative technical solutions. The study is proposing a solarpowered irrigation system designed to optimize water usage and ensure sustainable agricultural practices. The findings reveal that the lack of effective water management systems limits agricultural productivity and water security despite adequate rainfall. By implementing the proposed solutions, the study demonstrates the potential to significantly enhance agricultural productivity (SDG2) and ensure long-term water security, thereby directly contributing to improved rural livelihoods (SDG 8). Integrating local knowledge with scientific research has resulted in comprehensive, community-oriented solutions for sustainable agriculture with the help of clean energy (SDG7). This research provides a replicable model for other rural areas facing similar challenges, demonstrating the potential of integrated approaches to achieve long-term water security, agricultural sustainability, and economic resilience in the face of climate variability.

A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, covering 79 papers; 8 examined both drivers and barriers, 8 focused on drivers, and 63 on obstacles. Based on this review, a conceptual framework is proposed to support the integration of CE, SP, and I4.0 technologies. This framework highlights how linking these three components (CE, SP, and 14.0 technologies) can provide managers with opportunities to optimize benefits by enhancing drivers and mitigating challenges. The results show that the key drivers frequently repeated in the literature are increasing awareness, a skilled workforce, experienced leaders, competitive advantage, and cost savings. However, the major barriers are management support, governmental directives, digital infrastructure, and data privacy. This study provides a diagnostic tool for managers to evaluate their readiness for implementing CE and 14.0 initiatives, ensuring effective investment in sustainability efforts.

AB  - The recent rising cost of farm produce in Nigeria could be linked to low rainfall as a result of climate change amongst other factors. This research proposes an autonomous irrigation system from a standalone hybrid renewable energy sources (RESs) for Obafemi Awolowo University Farm, Ile-Ife, Nigeria, to combat hunger and climate change. The study considers solar PV, wind and battery storage system for robust energy generation while upholding the ecological and environmental benefits from these RESs. The proposed off-grid architecture was designed and optimized using HOMER Pro software. The evaluation metrics are levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), and greenhouse gas emission reduction. The modeling parameters of the farm’s load profile are average daily load demand, daily load demand, peak load, and load factor with the corresponding values of 62.91 kWh/d, 2.62 kW, 9.10 kW and 29%, respectively. The results from the simulation revealed that LCOE of wind turbine and PV solar of the study area are 5.60 $/kWh and 0.169 $/kWh, respectively, for an estimated lifecycle of 15 years. Based on the available surface meteorological data of the study area from NASA, the optimized cost result for proposed farm is given to be solar PV and battery storage system.

AB  - Climate change is currently the biggest environmental threat, being the cities responsible for a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. In this sense, the transport sector is among the main causes for both emissions and the depletion of non-renewable resources. Considering this scenario, there is an appeal to build more accessible, smart, sustainable and energy-efficient cities, promoting energy transition in urban systems and increasing the quality of urban life. This review aims to analyse transport and urban mobility studies that employ optimisation techniques to achieve environmental-related, sustainability, energy transition or climate change mitigation goals. After an overview regarding modelling aspects of how such goals were addressed, the nature of the objective functions, the perspectives considered, and the network application, such studies were classified into five areas and further detailed. The areas comprise: (i) planning and policy-making; (ii) environmental variables; (iii) demand and traffic management; (iv) technology and energy; and (v) non-spatial measures. In this sense, future research directions should include optimisation models that consider the social aspects of transport and the interests of passengers, operators, and the community simultaneously, improve the modelling of environmental impacts to increase its robustness, and deal with large network problems.

AB  - In recent years, the escalating challenges of climate change and the imperative for sustainable development have catalyzed the need for more energy-efficient buildings. The use of digital twins has been accelerated by advances in Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, data analytics, and novel computational methods. A new digital twin system is introduced in this paper for the modeling of Air Handling Units (AHUs), designed to accurately simulate the energy behavior and consumption of the system. The digital twin, called AHUSim, leverages an accurate mathematical model of the AHU, a modular architecture, a simple organization of the code and the use of modern tools and approaches for the implementation. This paper details the development, implementation, and validation of AHUSim, underlining its potential impact on reducing energy consumption and operational costs in buildings, thereby contributing to the broader goals of energy efficiency and sustainability. Preliminary results show the usage of AHUSim to model the physical variables that are involved in the functioning of an AHU, and the results that can be obtained in terms of assessment of energy consumption under different working conditions.

Findings reveal that NDVI variations in the Himalayan region are not Granger caused by GTemp but are significantly (p-value < 0.05) caused by Preci. However, the integrated effect of GTemp and Preci has a causal effect on NDVI. Furthermore, Preci exhibited a bidirectional relationship with NDVI, emphasizing the mutual influence between Preci patterns and NDVI dynamics. This study provides essential insights for scholars and planners aiding climate change and biodiversity management and aligning with sustainable development goals in the fragile Himalayan ecosystem.

AB  - Climate change is a significant threat to humanity and must be addressed in building design. This study introduces a novel framework that integrates Circular Economy (CE) principles into the design of residential buildings, addressing not only operational energy but also embodied carbon emissions, material reuse, and end-of-life strategies. By extending the focus beyond operational performance, it bridges the gap between lifecycle sustainability and architectural design, offering actionable insights for achieving environmentally and economically efficient buildings. This study investigates the integration of circular economy (CE) principles to enhance thermal comfort and reduce CO2 equivalent emissions in residential buildings in Iran from 2021 to 2022. A multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (ANN) was developed and validated using performance metrics, including mean square error (MSE) and the coefficient of correlation (R), achieving high accuracy with MSE = 0.39e−2 MWh and R values of 0.9974, 0.99854, and 0.99886 for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Using Grasshopper software with Ladybug and Honeybee plugins, four residential building plans were simulated, and the best design solution (BS) demonstrated an 8 %–12 % increase in PMV and a 21 %–26 % reduction in thermal load across different zones compared to the worst solution (WS). The optimal configuration achieved a thermal comfort index of 64.13 % with a window-to-wall ratio (WWR) of 50 %, minimum U-value (WLC1 and WID1), and shading dimensions of 0.3 m and 4 for DSH and NSH, respectively. These findings show that the proposed ANN model is effective in predicting CO2 equivalent emissions and guiding CE-based design strategies. The study provides actionable insights for reducing carbon emissions through CE principles, supporting contractors, homebuyers, and policymakers in advancing sustainable construction practices.

AB  - Water is an essential resource demanded worldwide and it is quite debatable owing to the economic, political, and energy characteristics of any region. Off-grid water filtration plants are an alternative for communities where transportation of freshwater becomes a real challenge due to a lack of infrastructure for the water potabilization processes. For such potable water filtration plants, hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) can be a viable solution to meet their energy demand meanwhile providing a sustainable water solution. The main contribution of this work is the unique methodology, which starts with a sizing procedure of various hybrid energy systems using a commercial software “Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER)” and spreadsheet algorithms, followed by a “Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)” based multiobjective optimization. Single-objective optimization scenarios contain photovoltaic installation capacity, wind turbines, diesel generators, and battery energy storage systems including Pb-acid (Lead-acid), Li-ion (Lithium-ion), and AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) technologies as design variables to maximize the cost of electricity or net-present-cost. Multiobjective optimization also involved environmental (CO2 emissions i.e. carbon dioxide emissions) and water cost indices as an additional packet to single-objective optimization scenarios. Afterward, a multicriteria decision-making tool using “The Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” is applied on the Pareto front to attain the final optimization results. The analysis is further explored in depth by generating digital twins (surrogate or meta model) of HRES data using artificial intelligence techniques (artificial neural network and group-method-of-data-handling). Furthermore, calculus and statistical sensitivity analysis assist in the identification of the significant variables in the design procedure. In summary, the technical contribution of this work can be divided into two sections. The first one is the design of a hybrid energy system for the water management of an isolated community of the indigenous Mayan region of Yucatan, Mexico, which has never been considered before. Secondly, the technical contribution is related to the usage of environmental emissions as an objective function, which is not considered in the traditional design of hybrid energy systems by the software HOMER. Environmental emission as an objective function is not considered while designing a hybrid energy system in commerical softwares like HOMER, in fact, HOMER provides a list of environmental impacts but it is a secondary outcome as a result of technoeconomic optimization. Analysis of results between HOMER pro and spreadsheet has shown conformity, reporting that the optimal case consists of a photovoltaic system, diesel generator, and Li-ion technology of battery storage with capacities of ∼17 kW, ∼5kW, and 44–48 kWh, respectively, corresponding to a net present cost ranging from 70,000 United States Dollars (USD) to 79,000 USD and a cost of electricity ranging from 0.205 to 0.229 USD/kWh. The achievements obtained with multiobjective optimization indicate that the cost of electricity and net present cost can be further reduced by 0.86 % and 0.73 %, respectively, at a decrement of only 0.4% of the renewable fraction as compared to the single objective optimization scenario. It is concluded that multiobjective optimization provides an add-in feature to HOMER by using environmental emissions as an objective function. The design procedure and adapted methodology can be useful to promote sustainable development in the statewide context and can provide a scientific justification to national energy policymakers.

AB  - Current research on solar chimneys has focused on developing regression-based empirical models, which might not be correct enough compared to the soft computing tools i.e., techniques of artificial intelligence. Current research has also published the search algorithm-based single-objective optimization of solar chimneys, whereas the latest genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimization can be more useful for decision-making purposes. Current research has also not focused on the macro or global impact of the usage of solar chimneys in context with the energy, economic, environmental, social, and political framework of the world. This research fills these gaps by the development of a digital twin model of the solar chimney using a multivariate regression model based on the least square method and an artificial intelligence (AI) method based on multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) and their comparison. A multiobjective optimization study along with the application of Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to optimize the geometric dimensions of the solar chimney considering four different climatic zones using an elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to maximize the number of air changes per hour, energy efficiency, and specific environmental influence. The results have shown that the statistical performance indicators like the coefficient of regression, etc., are higher for the MLP-ANN technique as compared to the multivariate regression method, thus, the AI technique is preferred. Comparison of optimization results with the base case condition has shown that the number of air changes can be improved between ∼71% and 87%. The global projection has demonstrated that the integration of solar chimneys in low-income countries with high air-conditioners installation rates must be necessary. It is also recommended to use solar chimneys in high-income countries for the renovation of the existing built environment to decrease the energy intensity of the building sector.

AB  - A unique, solar-driven hydrogen energy system is developed for data centers in this study by specifically developed Arctic Regions and addressing three of the key sustainable development targets of the United Nations, namely affordable and clean energy, industry-innovation-infrastructure and climate action. A bifacial photovoltaic (PV) plant is integrated with an ammonia trilateral Rankine cycle heat recovery system, a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, and a PEM fuel cell system with the additional cooling stream. A case study is carried out for a data center with 11.2 MW electrical capacity in the Arctic Region, Norilsk. A time-dependent analysis is performed with hourly meteorologic and simulation data by considering commercially available solar components and actual meteorological measurements. Both energy and exergy approaches are used in order to conduct thermodynamic analysis and assessment. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies are found to be 23.42% and 24.33% for the average ambient conditions, respectively. An average of 2920.7 tons of hydrogen is produced annually, while 2728.7 tons of it are consumed. The data center consumes 92.2 GWh electricity with 172.3 GWh total annual energy demand, which is 100% met by the 175 MWp bifacial PV plant, 11.6 MW fuel cell, 109.1 MW electrolyzer and 375 kWp heat recovery systems. 100% self-sufficiency is reached by exploiting the arctic environment's unique conditions, low temperature, and high albedo with a uniquely designed integrated system by producing 17.6 GWh more electricity just from the bifacial gains and heat recovery. The LCOE for the grid-connected scenario is found between $0.0275/kWh and $0.0395/kWh, and for the stand-alone scenario is found between $0.0945/kWh and $0.1361/kWh.

AB  - The focus on sustainable development and the transition to renewable energy sources has intensified due to the risks associated with climate change. This study provides new insights into the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and climate policy uncertainty (CPU) on the development of renewable energy (RE) in China. Utilizing a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) framework, the asymmetric relationship between these variables from January 2013 to April 2023 is revealed. The empirical results indicate a significant positive asymmetric effect of AI on RE development, with downturns in AI having a more pronounced influence compared to upswings. Additionally, CPU has a positive effect on RE development, also exhibiting an asymmetric pattern where declines in CPU have a more substantial impact than upturns. These findings highlight the critical roles of AI and CPU in renewable energy development and add new dimensions to existing research. Policymakers should consider these asymmetric dynamics when formulating strategies to facilitate the energy transition through climate policymaking and the advancement of AI-driven technologies.

AB  - The convergence of Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) is examined in this review as a promising approach to advancing sustainable energy solutions. Recognized for their lightweight, flexible, and cost-effective properties, OPVs are highlighted as viable alternatives within renewable energy applications, particularly suited for integration in building infrastructure and portable energy sources. A discussion of OPV mechanisms and structures, such as single-layer, bilayer, and bulk heterojunction cells, is provided to outline the unique efficiencies and challenges each architecture presents. AI, especially through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, is shown to transform OPV research, enhancing both material discovery and device optimization. Through AI-driven processes, rapid predictions of power conversion efficiency (PCE), material selection automation, and high-throughput screening are achieved, effectively minimizing experimental time and cost. Recent developments in AI applications, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Bayesian optimization, are reviewed for their contributions to improving OPV performance, stability, and scalability. Case studies are included to demonstrate AI’s impact in areas such as predictive modeling, real-time monitoring, and optimization of device architecture, all of which contribute to efficiency gains and improved material durability. Challenges, however, are noted, with data quality issues, the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and gaps in AI-aided material innovation identified as key areas for ongoing development. This review highlights how the intersection of AI and OPV technology not only accelerates the path toward efficient, scalable renewable energy but also underscores the importance of interdisciplinary research in advancing sustainable, high-performance photovoltaic solutions.

AB  - Advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be applied using Edge Computing (EC) to detect anomalies, which is the basis of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). EC has emerged as a solution for processing and analysing information on IoT devices. This field aims to allow the implementation of Machine/Deep Learning (DL) models on MicroController Units (MCUs). Integrating anomaly detection analysis on Internet of Things (IoT) devices produces clear benefits as it ensures the use of accurate data from the initial stage. However, this process poses a challenge due to the unique characteristics of IoT. This article presents a Systematic Literature Mapping of scientific research on the application of anomaly detection techniques in EC using MCUs. A total of 18 papers published over the period 2021–2023 were selected from a total of 162 in four databases of scientific papers. The results of this paper provide a comprehensive overview of anomaly detection using TinyML and MCUs. The main contributions of this survey are the fact that it aims to: (a) study techniques for anomaly detection in ML/DL and validation metrics used in the AIoT; (b) analyse data used in the estimation of models; (c) show how ML is applied in EC using hardware or software; (d) investigate the main microcontrollers, types of power supply, and communication technology; and (e) develop a taxonomy of ML/DL algorithms used to detect anomalies in TinyML. Finally, the benefits and challenges of this kind of TinyML analysis are described.

AB  - This study examines the socio-economic factors that shape consumer behaviour related to carbon footprint awareness within the retail and services sectors. Utilizing a structured, dual-model framework, we analyse the complex relationships between key socio-economic determinants, such as income, education, age, gender, and environmental consciousness, and sustainable behaviours, including recycling, green product searches, and engagement with eco-friendly practices. The methodology combines two machine learning models to achieve both detailed analysis and interpretability. The primary model, based on the Tabular Network Regressor (TabNet), captures nuanced, high-dimensional interactions across socio-economic variables, while the secondary, interpretive model, using the Categorical Boosting Regressor (catBoost), simplifies these insights without compromising accuracy, making findings accessible for policy-oriented applications. Our results reveal that income, education, and environmental consciousness are significant predictors of carbon footprint awareness. Moreover, consumers who regularly engage in sustainable actions, such as recycling or searching for eco-friendly products, exhibit heightened awareness of their environmental impact, underscoring the influence of habitual eco-conscious behaviours. Through a Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis, this study enhances the interpretability of results, providing a clear, data-driven understanding of how specific socio-economic factors contribute to sustainable consumer actions. This research advances knowledge on socio-economic influences in sustainability by offering actionable insights for policymakers, including targeted strategies that address diverse demographic characteristics and promote inclusive, effective policies for sustainable consumer behaviour in the retail and services industries.

AB  - The article discusses the essence of circular economy, its opportunities and specifics in Russia and how the process of its development is controlled given the best practices around the world. In terms of theory and methodology the study is based on the scientific works of national and foreign scientists about new economic systems aimed at achieving sustainable development and reducing the negative impact on the environment. The study defines the concept of circular economy, an economic model whose basic idea is that the chain of production and consumption should rely on obtaining secondary resources from the waste produced from material resources used in the previous cycle and allowing for the achievements of digitalization, which results in the closure of the chain. Today society actively takes measures aimed at minimizing waste and reducing the consumption of traditional primary energy resources. It is proved that the best possible option for Russia is an economically oriented way in which a circular economy is formed. It implies creating a special economic system that will reuse materials and save resources, and be aimed at creating values for society, economy and the environment in each part of the system in accordance with the concept of Industry 4.0. The SWOT-analysis of the process in which Russia can transition to a circular economy has identified opportunities and threats that should become an information base for developing further measures aimed at including recycling in the environmental, social and economic processes and reducing risks as this economic system is being managed. According to the study, the operational scheme of the circular economy in Russia that has been developed reflects the main components of this process and the target results, given the possibilities of state financial support and institutional effects

Advanced metering devices (smart meters) are being installed throughout electric networks in Europe and in the United States. The high-resolution energy consumption data which are transmitted by some smart meters to the utility company allow identification and monitoring of equipment within consumers' homes. Our research shows that the analysis of the household's electricity usage profile at a 0.5s-1 sample rate permits identification of audiovisual content. By collecting a single household smart meter data over a period of one month, our forensic results also show that audiovisual content identification is not heavily obstructed by typical electric appliance activities in a household.

AB  - In Bangladesh, state financial intermediary IDCOL's grant based program so far installed more than 4.19 million solar home (SHS). But access to clean energy without quality energy-efficient household appliances, an issue, yet to receive necessary attention. As a result, 18 million off-grid people using SHSs in rural Bangladesh have no or limited access to quality energy efficient appliances like TV/Fan to improve their daily livelihood. A suitable national scale dissemination program mechanism on energy efficient appliances is necessary to achieve that goal. A brief technical assessment has also been conducted on the available efficient off-grid appliances to assess their appropriateness in the context of SHS systems of IDCOL. Roles of donors, developing partners along with national nodal agencies, regulators, financiers and private agencies are being assessed at length with an expectation that the proposed appliances dissemination mechanism will be able to bring right synergies in favor of household appliances sales uptake in the off-grid solar market of Bangladesh.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to demonstrate if sustainable supply chain practices can lead to a positive corporate performance, in recent research internal efficiency has been emphasized over external effectiveness. This research explores two internal and two external management variables. Furthermore, the implications of Sustainable Supply Chain Management incorporation with regard to its related internal and external practices have not been explored in the literature with regards to developing countries and small and medium enterprises context. It is also noted that recognition of the economic benefits obtained from sustainability programs implemented can have managerial and practical implications but needs more evidences. Structural equation modelling approach is used for analysis whereby a theoretical model is adapted from previously published research. A purposive multi-industry approach to sampling was adopted to select environment friendly firms. After validity and reliability of data, the sample equation was analyzed using structural modelling for relationship effects. Firms can learn from the results to align their stance towards sustainable advancements as a competitive advantage.

AB  - Grid-edge technologies are altering the traditional topology and functionality of the power grid, in which electricity flows only downstream. Distributed energy resources (DERs) are being increasingly incorporated into the bi-directional grid topology using modern communication technologies, further decentralizing power generation. Since the intelligent grid relies so heavily on bi-directional communication and the transaction of data, safeguarding user identities and sensitive information online is of paramount importance. This study evaluates the maturity of various grid-edge technologies and use cases, including DERs, smart metering, electric vehicles, microgrids, and local energy markets using a criteria-based analysis. The focus is on digital privacy and cybersecurity, as well as other related aspects that may arise when implementing these grid-edge technologies. Furthermore, both established and emerging technologies, as well as proven procedures for safeguarding sensitive information, are scrutinized. The collective expert opinion is collected via a tailored survey to capture the broader engineering judgment of the authors. This systematic assessment considers interdisciplinary criteria such as technological, economic, and regulatory maturity, as well as threats to user privacy, cybersecurity, and physical safety.

AB  - Industrial policies in Africa seem silent on energy efficiency measures for small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) in the continent. Existing literature indicates that SMEs in Nigeria are unaware of energy end-use efficiency. Towards identifying policies for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 9, and 13, energy end-use efficiency issues within one hundred (100) manufacturing SMEs were empirically analyzed. Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) technique was used to select the firms based on recent framing of enterprises by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN). The study utilized structured questionnaires and interviews to capture cross-sectional data. The research identified some enablers of energy end-use efficiency in the companies. Factors identified equipment/appliance selection, capital and financial incentives, information and technical capacity, management commitment, smart manufacturing, and government policy or legislation. Contrary to the view in existing studies, the outcome of the study shows a strong awareness of energy end-use efficiency among 93.81% of the sampled firms. We recommend the roles of relevant stakeholders and some strategic measures essential for the improvement of energy end-use efficiency in SMEs towards decarbonizing the industrial sector and achieving sustainable development.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the current international regulation of exploration and exploitation of gas and oil in the ocean in order to provide legal recommendations to preserve marine biodiversity and to prevent climate change in oceans. Offshore oil and gas exploration has been increasing worldwide in the last years and is taking place in deeper waters and extreme environments. Impacts on the environment include, impact on fish stocks and mammals during seismic surveys, emissions through gas flaring, operative pollution derived from daily activity such as discharge of substances and accidental pollution. From the environmental point of view, the "offshore" oil and gas exploration and exploitation may be divided into two stages. First, the stage previous to the installation of the structures that I will denominate ‘preventive-precautionary stage’, where the security aspects and all the preventive-precautionary tools introduced by Environmental law as environmental impact assessment, monitoring, participation of citizens shall be applied in order to avoid environmental damage. If environmental law tools are not appropriately applied during this stage, the second stage, liability and reparation for environmental damage will follow. The essential results show that there is no international convention in force regarding the issue; however, there have been several attempts to achieve this objective. Two accidents, the first one a blow-out occurred in 2009 on the Montara well situated in the Australian EEZ which affected the cost of Indonesia and the other one in 2010, in the Deepwater Horizon highlighted again the need of a sustainable regulation of the topic. In 2012 the Comité Maritime International (CMI) constituted again a Sub-Group of study of the topic and in 2013, after the request of the Indonesian delegation the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed to analyze the topic. IMO conclusion was that there is no need for an international agreement, but that bilateral or regional agreements shall be reached. As there is no global convention devoted to the subject, I will study the United Nations Law Convention on the Law of the Sea (‘UNCLOS, 1982’) applicable provisions and several maritime and environmental international conventions in force in order to determine if they are applicable to offshore structures; namely, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (‘UNFCC, 1992’) and the Convention on Biological Biodiversity (‘CBD, 1982’). In relation to this Convention, we I will also study the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, specially target 11. As regards maritime conventions, I will analyze among others, the Protocol Relating to the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (including Annexes, Final Act and 1973 International Convention) (‘MARPOL 73/78’), the 1996 Protocol to the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matters (‘LC 1972 and LC PROT 1996’), the 1992 Protocol to Amend the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (‘CLC 1992’), the 1990 International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation (‘OPRC 1990’), the 2001 International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (‘Bunkers Convention’), the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (‘Hong Kong Convention’) and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (‘SOLAS 1974’). I will also study applicable regional agreements such as the Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution resulting from Exploration and Exploitation of the Continental Shelf and the Seabed and its Subsoil (‘Offshore Protocol’) to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean (‘Barcelona Convention’) and private agreements, such as Offshore Pollution Liability Agreement (‘OPOL’). Moreover, I will analyze soft law instruments such as Rio Declaration, Agenda 21, and Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 14. I conclude that enacting an international convention regarding the topic negotiated with the support of IMO, UNEP and IUCN is a priority in spite of opinions on the contrary in order to mark uniformity and based in UNCLOS Sections 194 (1) and 205 (8). A strong global political will is necessary in order to achieve this aim. This international convention shall cover both fixed and mobile structures and not only compensation issues, but also application of the precautionary principle. Meanwhile, exploration and exploitation of oil and gas in the ocean is regulated by different conventions and soft law, one of its application for instance is that the relevant coastal states shall apply for "Areas-to-be-Avoided", Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSA) and Special Areas (SA) to identify no-go zones and discharge restrictions.

AB  - Sharing location traces with context-aware service providers has privacy implications. Location-privacy preserving mechanisms, such as obfuscation, anonymization and cryptographic primitives, have been shown to have impractical utility/privacy tradeoff. Another solution for enhancing user privacy is to minimize data sharing by executing the tasks conventionally carried out at the service providers' end on the users' smartphones. Although the data volume shared with the untrusted entities is significantly reduced, executing computationally demanding server-side tasks on resource-constrained smartphones is often impracticable. To this end, we propose a novel perspective on lowering the computational complexity by treating spatiotemporal trajectories as space-time signals. Lowering the data dimensionality facilitates offloading the computational tasks onto the digital-signal processors and the usage of the non-blocking signal-processing pipelines. While focusing on the task of user mobility modeling, we achieve the following results in comparison to the state of the art techniques: (i) mobility models with precision and recall greater than 80%, (ii) reduction in computational complexity by a factor of 2.5, and (iii) reduction in power consumption by a factor of 0.5. Using real-world mobility datasets, we demonstrate the suitability of our technique to function on smartphones.

Building units could achieve these goals directly through an energy design and their corresponding energy efficiency. Initially, a building is being simulated through a computational model, based on parameters of the methodology established by the Energy Efficiency Regulation of Buildings (E.E.R.B.). Afterwards, the results are being thoroughly checked and evaluated in the frame of its energy efficiency, as well as its financial data. The conclusions can be deduced through the exploitation of Internet of Things - IoT technology by evolving the building and thus, expanding the city into a smart city.

AB  - Obsolete Electronic and Electrical Equipment (EEE) contain hazardous substances which are a threat to environmental sustainability and human health. Electronic waste (e-waste) contain minerals worth billions of dollars which, if properly, recovered and managed, can create employment and wealth. While developing countries have recorded double-digit annual growth in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) usage, only a few countries in the sub-Saharan Africa region have enacted policies that enforce management of e-waste, making e-waste one of the emerging solid waste challenges. Data was collected from 17 Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) which revealed that the majority of the participants had no knowledge of the national e-waste policy. The findings revealed that all of the participants were aware of the effects of e-waste yet more than half did not have approved e-waste policies. The results show that all institutions stored obsolete equipment in their storerooms for a while before disposing of them by auctioning to staff members and the public, while some of the e-waste was disposed of in dumpsites. More than half of the institutions disposed of e-waste as ordinary garbage, while only a tenth took e-waste for recycling and one institution got it collected by e-waste collectors. Institutions were fueling e-waste as more than 80% of the participants preferred to replace obsolete electrical equipment with less than a fifth considered repairing. This study could help policy-makers in enacting institutional and national policies, the establishment of appropriate collection and recycling facilities within institutions and nationally, as well as influence future research.

AB  - Researches of the energy efficiency for ventilation systems with vortex regulation devices have been performed. The main schemes of ventilation units are considered: with a vortex regulation device in the pressure line, in a parallel line, in the suction line. The analysis of working processes for the presented schemes of ventilation units is carried out, the differences in the working processes of regulating the parameters of ventilation systems are noted. As the characteristics of the ventilator, the dependences for the total head on the flow rate, as well as the efficiency on the flow rate are used. These dependences are approximated by parabolas. To research the energy efficiency of ventilation systems with vortex regulation devices, the dependence of the relative power for the ventilator unit on the depth of flow rate regulation is considered as the regulation characteristic. The dependencies have been established and the method for calculating the regulation characteristics has been proposed. The example of calculating the regulation characteristics for ventilation system with the ventilator unit based on the industrial ventilator is given. The possibility of increasing the energy efficiency for the ventilation system by reducing the power consumption by ventilator unit is shown. This is achieved by decreasing the energy losses associated with the regulation process, and the amount of power reduction is determined by the installation scheme of the vortex regulation device.

AB  - According to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), higher education institutions (HEI) act as stakeholders in reducing climate change. Some authors identified the lack of general criteria for calculating HEI's Carbon Footprint (CF) and the impossibility of making equivalent comparisons of CF sustainability metrics between HEI in various contexts and countries due to the absence of measurement standardization. Despite several efforts by governments, professors, researchers, students, and communities to improve sustainability in HEI, universities continue to have significant CF. HEI's must quickly standardize and enhance their CF if they are to be taken as models by other institutions to meet the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). This paper presents a systematic review of sustainability actions towards a neutral CF in HEI through a bibliometric analysis. The results showed that the strategies most used to reduce the carbon footprint for sustainable management are based on the Greenhouse Protocol and the ISO 14064, according to the 20 universities analyzed.

AB  - Digital twins are virtual replicas of actual things, processes, or systems that are generated by integrating real-time data, modeling, and simulation. These digital copies allow for the monitoring, analysis, and optimization of their real-world counterparts. This helps to enhance decision-making and performance in areas like as manufacturing, healthcare, and urban planning. Digital twins have the capability to accurately replicate the actions and condition of their physical counterparts, allowing for the anticipation of maintenance needs, monitoring of performance, and analysis of potential scenarios. They utilize technology such as the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, data analytics, and machine learning to consistently enhance their virtual models by incorporating real-time data from linked devices. Digital twins are utilized in several domains, such as predictive maintenance of machinery, optimization of manufacturing processes, simulation of medical operations, and even modeling of entire cities for urban planning. Digital twins improve efficiency, productivity, and creativity by offering insights into intricate systems. They also help reduce expenses and dangers involved with physical experimentation or testing. This paper covers a brief implementation of the technologies Digital Twins (DT) along with the Internet of Things (IoT) in solving the food wastage problem that happens during the post-harvest supply chain. About 30% of food gets wasted globally every year from the time it is harvested till it reaches the customer due to poor supply chain management. There is an urgent need to resolve this issue with the help of cutting-edge technologies. This depicts why it is important to reimagine the existing supply chain with detailed implementation and integration of DT. Also, there are relevant case studies and examples to strengthen the idea behind.

AB  - This research paper explores the design, working principles, and applications of light pipes, which utilize the principle of total internal reflection to channel natural sunlight into building interiors. By efficiently capturing and directing sunlight, light pipes offer a sustainable solution for reducing the reliance on artificial lighting, thus contributing significantly to energy savings. The study examines various configurations and materials used in light pipe construction to maximize light transmission and minimize losses. Additionally, the integration of light pipes with heat management systems is discussed, highlighting their potential to reduce indoor heating loads by dissipating excess thermal energy. This dual functionality not only enhances energy efficiency but also improves thermal comfort within buildings. Through case studies and experimental data, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of light pipes in diverse architectural contexts, underscoring their role in promoting sustainability and reducing the environmental footprint of the built environment. The findings suggest that widespread adoption of light pipe technology could lead to substantial energy savings and contribute to global sustainability goals.

AB  - Higher-strength, longer-lived, and environmentally friendly high-performance concrete (HPC) necessitates advanced formulation of materials and predictive modeling techniques. The traditional designs of high-performance concrete often fail to optimize the mix parameters suitably, mainly from the point of sustainability view, and lack the capacity to model complex nonlinear relationships among material properties and performance metrics. The current paper introduces the integrated framework of nano-engineered materials that comprises nano-silica, graphene oxide (GO), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) along with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods in the predictive modeling and optimization of high-performance concrete (HPC). The Machine Learning (ML) models consisting of Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) were implemented to predict compressive and tensile strengths, elastic modulus, and durability metrics such as chloride penetration and sulfate resistance sets. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS), improved model interpretability and performance sets. Optimization of mix designs was carried out using bio-inspired algorithms, namely Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to balance mechanical performance, material efficiency, and environmental sustainability. The results suggest strength improvement up to 15% and durability up to 30% while reducing cement content and associated carbon emissions. This is the framework, which exploits artificial intelligence techniques in predictive modeling and optimization to achieve scalable and sustainable next-generation high-performance concrete designs. It is at the intersection of theoretical potential and practical application that the work is advancing the role of artificial intelligence in construction material science toward contributing to sustainable infrastructure development process.

Data analysis investigates the trends in the number of published papers, citation numbers and countries to explore the hotspots and frontier topics. The findings showed that it is a current necessity to address this research gap in the Arab countries compared to other countries with good track record therein. It was found that that the definition of an SBR varies according to different contexts, building type and condition as well as the aims and scope of the renovation undertaken. This has received increasing worldwide attention from many research institutions and different proposed approaches, nevertheless, the majority of published papers point to more concern for energy efficiency at the expense of other sustainable parameters. This is particularly important to consider in public buildings with special concerns for educational facilities following the COVID outbreak. Nevertheless, renovation activities may greatly impact occupants’ health in the long and short terms due to excessive pollutants’ release. Eventually, this shall enable better exchange of knowledge and lessons learnt.

AB  - The perception of climate change mitigation efforts goes in wider and different phases, from individual incentives to community as a whole. Paris agreement conferences aim to delineate the climate change problem and strengthen the collaboration between the potential countries and developing countries which facing more challenges in terms of financial resource and socioeconomic. The agreement requires each country to implement their domestic climate policy which covers economic, social, and political issues in responding to climate change such as low carbon emission development plans, mitigation and adaptation measures, and climate resilience development. These climate actions are delivered as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which is a long-term achieving low-emissions plan and reflect the national GHG emission reduction priorities. This research explores the NDC in Thailand context with focus on the development of infrastructure construction sector which is a significant sector contribute to economic growth of the country. Thailand's Nationally Determined Contributions implements 15 climate long-term approaches for year 2021–2030 which covers to 3 categories: Energy and Transportation, Waste Management, and Industrial Manufacture and Product Application. In Thailand, likewise other countries, energy sector is the most contributor to the largest portion of GHG emission as it is interconnected with all activities including the focus area, construction of infrastructure. This research aims to analyze relevant approaches for construction sector indicated in the NDC Roadmap on Mitigation 2021–2030, and the Guidelines for driving and evaluating which includes the mitigation and adaptation measures on climate change. The construction sector by compliance with the NDCs approaches appears to be a potentially significant factor for sustainable development and low carbon future, likewise, building climate resilience through mitigation and adaptation practices, for instance, the application of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EbA), the construction rating system as a guideline for measuring sustainability in both building scale and component scale. In addition, to achieve the long-term goal, the participation and collaboration have to be bonded strongly in all phases to support climate action mechanisms in both domestic and international level.

AB  - Federated learning is presented as an effective solution to train artificial intelligence models on the Internet of Things networks without centralizing data, thus preserving privacy and minimizing security risks. However, its implementation in low-power devices, such as Tiny Machine Learning, faces significant challenges due to the processing, memory, and unstable connectivity limitations that characterize these environments. This study addresses these issues by developing a federated system optimized for Tiny Machine Learning devices, integrating differential privacy and encryption techniques adapted to their constraints. The methodology employed includes the evaluation of model precision and energy consumption in variable communication scenarios, as well as heterogeneous workloads. The results show that federated learning reduces energy consumption by 33% compared to the centralized approach, reaching an average of 100 mW. Furthermore, implementing differential privacy-maintained precision with a loss of only 1.2% demonstrates the feasibility of protecting sensitive data without substantially affecting performance. However, precision dropped by 8% in high communication loss scenarios, underlining the importance of stable connectivity for optimal system performance.

AB  - Environmental impact reduction is crucial for sustainable urban planning, as it mitigates the harmful effects of urbanization on ecosystems, climate, and public health. As cities expand, minimizing environmental degradation through well-planned strategies becomes essential to ensuring long-term sustainability. This paper integrates T-Spherical Fuzzy Sets (T-SFS) to address the inherent uncertainty in evaluating urban development alternatives. T-SFS enables more accurate assessments by capturing expert judgment variability, particularly for complex criteria such as energy efficiency, biodiversity, and land use optimization. In addition, the study employs the CRADIS method alongside the Logarithmic Percentage Change-Driven Objective Weighting (LOPCOW) technique to assign precise weights to evaluation criteria. This integrated approach ensures that each criterion’s significance is accurately represented, supporting robust decision-making. The results provide a comparative analysis of five urban development alternatives, helping urban planners prioritize sustainable options that balance environmental, social, and economic factors. By incorporating fuzzy logic and advanced decision-making techniques, this study offers a comprehensive tool for policymakers to make informed decisions that contribute to sustainable urban growth, ultimately fostering cities that are more resilient, eco-friendly, and beneficial to society.

With the current digital transformation within the biomanufacturing sector, the interest of automating fungi-based systems has intensified. The purpose of this paper was therefore to review the potentials connected to the use of automation and artificial intelligence in fungi-based systems. Automation is characterized by the substitution of manual tasks with mechanized tools. Artificial intelligence is, on the other hand, a domain within computer science that aims at designing tools and machines with the capacity to execute functions that would usually require human aptitude. Process flexibility, enhanced data reliability and increased productivity are some of the benefits of integrating automation and artificial intelligence in fungi-based bioprocesses. One of the existing gaps that requires further investigation is the use of such data-based technologies in the production of food from fungi.

This paper proposes an integrated cooling system for data centers which combines a heat pipe cooling cycle and a vapor compression cooling cycle. The operating mode of the system changes with the outdoor temperature. Key problems of the integrated system were solved such as the mix of the refrigerant and lubricant, the match of heat exchange areas and the durability of valves. A thermal equilibrium test was carried out to evaluate the system performance. Thermodynamic analyses based on experimental data show that the PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) of data centers using the integrated heat pipe system can be 0.3 lower than using the conventional air cooling systems in cold areas like Beijing and Harbin. The energy saving potential of the integrated heat pipe system varies with seasonal and regional climate changes.

AB  - The uncertainties of the crucial parameters have a considerable influence on the supervisory control performance of the water side free cooling system in data centers, especially for the model-based optimal control. To reduce the uncertainty of the key parameters in an operational data center hybrid cooling system, this study proposed an uncertainties self-correction method based on Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BI-MCMC) theory. Four novel enhanced self-correction strategies, including the benchmarks extended, adding sensitivity coefficient, local correction and prior distribution updated, were developed to handle the negative impacts caused by the various uncertain working conditions and complex relationships between parameters. The performance of the proposed method was fully investigated under the cases with single/multiple uncertain parameters with different degrees of uncertainty and deviation. For the uncertainties problem with single parameter error scenario, the basic BI-MCMC method reduced the error by at least 92.5%. For the multiple parameter uncertain scenarios, the designed enhanced strategies can significantly reduce the degree of the uncertainty, i.e. the correction accuracy is up to 98% and the absolute correction deviations are not more than 0.02. Therefore, the proposed method could provide a solution to the current challenges in handling the uncertainties and establishing a reliable model for the supervisory control.

Accurate indoor user positioning is fundamental to realizing occupant-centric controls. However, historic dwellings, with architectural heritage preservation requirements and diverse operational modes, present multiple challenges in terms of occupant monitoring and energy management. This research proposes a BLE positioning system based on the SAE-CNN algorithm to realize the analysis and prediction of occupant locations in a cost-effective and minimally-intrusive manner. The process begins by dividing spaces based on the mapped BIM model and cluster analysis. The RSSI maps of wireless signals collected from the Bluetooth beacons in each space are then preprocessed by Gaussian filter and sliding window techniques. Lastly, a machine learning algorithm refines the prediction model, which is integrated into a digital twin platform designed for energy consumption management. The system was implemented in a traditional Chinese dwelling in Wufu town, Fujian Province. The results are promising, showing that the positioning accuracy reached 1.5–2 m (95 % confidence interval), while the platform effectively presented the real-time positioning results as well as realized occupant-centric energy management. Moreover, the collected location information shed light on occupants' spatial usage habits, offering valuable insights for devising decarbonization retrofit strategies.

AB  - This paper conducts a comprehensive performance evaluation and optimization of single-phase immersion cooling (SPIC) systems to address challenges in data center server cooling. A three-dimensional model of blade servers with different cooling methods is constructed and numerically solved to compare thermal transport performance, flow characteristics, and energy consumption performance. Furthermore, the influence mechanisms of different oil coolants and operating conditions on SPIC system performance are studied. The results indicate that the SPIC scheme exhibits significant advantages in terms of heat transfer capability, heat transfer uniformity, and flow resistance loss. Moreover, the power usage effectiveness (PUE) of SPIC systems decreases by 20.8 % and 17.6 % compared to forced air cooling and water cooling plate solutions, respectively. The dynamic viscosity of oil coolants has the greatest impact on the SPIC performance. Moreover, high-viscosity silicone oil increases the flow resistance of SPIC systems and weakens the convective heat transfer capability between the coolant and components. By ensuring safe operation, increasing the inlet temperature of oil coolants reduces flow resistance losses and enhances heat transfer capacity. Additionally, initially increasing the mass flow rate improves convective heat transfer capacity. However, the heat transfer improvement gradually diminished beyond a certain threshold while flow resistance losses increased significantly.

AB  - Utilizing abundant and eco-friendly biomass is an effective strategy to realize the ‘carbon neutrality’ goal, aligning with contemporary demands for environmental sustainability, energy saving, and a low-carbon economy. Anaerobic digestion stands out as an energy-efficient option to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and the recovery of biofuels from lignocellulosic biowaste. However, the individual fermentation of nitrogen-deficient lignocellulosic biomass might cause process inhibition. Furthermore, the unbalanced microbial metabolic activity and insufficient electron transport can result in the accumulation of inhibitors, reducing the efficiency of anaerobic digestion. Although there have been significant developments in revitalizing strategies for the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass, existing studies often focus on isolated aspects rather than the entire process. Addressing this gap, this work provides a comprehensive overview of the whole-process of anaerobic digestion from design, implementation, and operations management. The comprehensively summarized anaerobic co-digestion feedstock options offer technical guidance for the scheme design of practical anaerobic digestion systems. Several recommendations are provided for the better management of lignocellulosic biomass by coupling anaerobic digestion with conductive materials, micro-aeration, and microbial electrochemical technology. The future research priorities for the optimization of process stability and product yield are discussed from new perspectives of conventional anaerobic digestion model No. 1 and emerging machine learning approaches. This work outlines the latest development in techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment of anaerobic digestion systems to support waste management decisions and improve operational processes along the solid waste production chain.

AB  - The increase in data center operating costs is driving innovation to improve their energy efficiency. Previous research has investigated computational and physical control intervention strategies to alleviate the competition between energy consumption and thermal performance in data center operation. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by proposing a cyber-physical systems (CPS) approach to innovatively integrate building information modeling (BIM) and wireless sensor networks (WSN). In the proposed framework, wireless sensors are deployed strategically to monitor thermal performance parameters in response to runtime server load distribution. Sensor data are collected and contextualized in reference to the building information model that captures the geometric and functional characteristics of the data center, which will be used as inputs of continuous simulations aiming to predict real-time thermal performance of server working environment. Comparing the simulation results against historical performance data via machine learning and data mining, facility managers can quickly pinpoint thermal hot zones and actuate intervention procedures to improve energy efficiency. This BIM-WSN integration also facilitates smarter power management by capping runtime power demand within peak power capacity of data centers and alerting power outage emergencies. This paper lays out the BIM-WSN integration framework, explains the working mechanism, and discusses the feasibility of implementation in future work.

AB  - In light of the growing need to mitigate climate change impacts, this study presents an innovative methodology combining ensemble machine learning with experimental data to accurately predict the carbon dioxide footprint (CO2-FP) of fly ash geopolymer concrete. The approach employs adaptive boosting to enhance decision tree regression (DTR) and support vector regression (SVR), resulting in a robust predictive framework. The models used key material features, including fly ash concentration, fine and coarse aggregates, superplasticizer, curing temperature, and alkali activator levels. These features were tested across three configurations (Combo-1, Combo-2, Combo-3) to determine optimal predictor combinations, with Combo-3 consistently yielding the highest predictive accuracy. The performance of the developed models was assessed based on standard metric indicators like mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual CO2-FP. Results demonstrated that the Adaboost-DTR model with Combo-3 configuration achieved the best performance metrics during testing (CC = 0.9665; NSE = 0.9343), outperforming both standalone and other ensemble models. The findings underscore the value of feature selection and boosting techniques in accurately estimating CO2 emissions for sustainable construction applications. This research offers remarkable benefits for policymakers and industry stakeholders aiming to optimize concrete compositions for environmental sustainability. The results support future integration with IoT systems to enable real-time CO2 monitoring in construction materials. Finally, this study establishes a foundation for developing efficient CO2-FP emission management tools.

AB  - China is a major energy consumer, accounting for 21.5% of the world’s total energy consumption. Therefore, building an energy-saving society is an inevitable development direction. In the “13th Five Year Plan” development goals, China clearly proposed the “green” development concept, with addressing climate change, environmental change, and green sustainable development as the core for research. The construction industry is an industry with high energy consumption, consistent with the national development goals, and advocating “developing green buildings” has become a hot topic and inevitable trend. Previously, in the study of cost effectiveness of green buildings, attention has been paid to the research and application of relevant general specifications and standards, and corresponding green building technologies. More attention has been paid to cost effectiveness evaluation methods. Among the “four savings and one environmental protection” proposed by green buildings, the incremental cost of energy conservation accounted for approximately 47%. However, there are few studies on the direct economic benefits of energy conservation, especially the lack of direct economic accounting and analysis of the increased costs and benefits, making it difficult to fully demonstrate the economic feasibility of green buildings. Therefore, many relevant objects such as governments, developers, and consumers cannot have an objective and accurate understanding of green buildings, which to some extent hinders the development, utilization, and promotion of green buildings in China in the future. In the Apriori algorithm studied in this paper, the incremental efficiency of green building energy conservation has been significantly improved. The maximum increase in revenue per square meter was 24.98 yuan.

AB  - Industrial energy consumption and export value are two important aspects of national economic growth and sustainable development, so understanding the interrelationship between them is of great significance for the government to make policy and enterprise decision-making. In this study, mathematical statistics will be used to establish a comprehensive evaluation model to evaluate the coupling degree between industrial energy consumption and the export value of Jiangsu province. First of all, collect and collate relevant data, including industrial energy consumption data and regional export value data. Finally, a coupling degree evaluation index is proposed to quantify the relationship between industrial energy consumption and regional exports. This indicator will provide decision support for governments, enterprises and research institutions to help them better manage industrial energy consumption and promote the development of export trade. Through this study, it will provide governments, enterprises and research institutions with a powerful tool to help them to better understand and manage the relationship between these two key economic indicators, thus promoting sustainable development and economic growth.

AB  - Nowadays the energy consumption has become one of the most urgent issues for Data center networks. For general network devices, the power is constant and independent from the actual transfer rate. Therefore the network devices are energy efficient when they are in full workload. The flow scheduling methods based on the exclusive routing can reduce the network energy consumption, as the exclusive routing paths can fully utilize all their links. However, these methods will no longer guarantee the energy efficiency of switches, as they handle flows in priority order by greedily choosing the path of available links instantaneously. In a previous work we proposed an extreme case of flow scheduling based on both link and switch utilization. Herein we consider general scenarios in data center networks and propose a novel energy efficient flow scheduling and routing algorithm in SDN. This method minimizes the overall energy for data center traffic in time dimension, and increases the utilization of switches and meet the flow requirements such as deadline. We did a series of simulation studies in the INET framework of OMNet++. The experiment results show that our algorithm can reduce the overall energy with respect to the traffic volume and reduce the flow completion time on average.

During this twenty-year timeframe, the world has experienced several major events, such as the economic crisis and the Paris climate agreement. This has led to significant changes in energy consumption patterns, especially in the context of rapid advances in renewable energy technologies. We looked at how energy usage and other important parameters relate using a large dataset from Kaggle and different linear regression models. The findings reveal a substantial correlation between per capita primary energy consumption and variables including access to electricity, the usage of clean fuels, the percentage of renewable energy consumption, and GDP per capita. These factors are well matched with the linear regression model. These findings not only provide insights into past energy consumption patterns, but also offer valuable suggestions for predicting future trends and formulating relevant policies.

AB  - Security and privacy of wireless sensor networks are key research issues recently. Most existing researches regarding wireless sensor network security consider homogenous sensor networks. To achieve better security and performance, we adopt a heterogeneous wireless sensor network (HWSN) model that consists of physically different types of sensor nodes. This paper presents a secure message distribution scheme with configurable privacy for HWSNs, which takes advantage of powerful high-end sensor nodes. The scheme establishes a message distribution topology in an efficient and secure manner. The sensor node can only generate one signature for all the messages for all the users, which can greatly save the communication and computation costs of the sensor node. On the other hand, the user can only know the messages intended for him based on a pre-set policy, which can meet the requirement of the privacy. We show that the scheme has small bandwidth requirements and it is resilient against the node compromise attack.

The screening of sustainable energy development evaluation indicators and the construction of indicator system are the important precondition for sustainable energy development evaluation. This paper initially establishes an integrative index system which combines such issues as energy, economics and environment. This system can support national strategy of natural resource exploitation to reach four goals, namely, the economic efficiency, energy efficiency, energy conservation and environmental protection, so that the government can carry out sustainable energy development in the policy planning and practice. Moreover, the system takes into account the science factor and energy investment factor, giving high priority to energy security.

AB  - Electricity market development (EMD) emerges to be a current concern following a shift of paradigm from EMD design with focuses upon energy as the key commodity to a need to deliver a sustainable low-carbon generation future. The feasible options of EMD are set to illustrate the interaction of the policy instruments, the market regulation and the sustainable investment environment. The economic benefits and costs have to be realized systematically and in a wide perspective including technical, operational and financial dimensions. The paper suggest that the energy policy of a sustainable electricity market development is set to ensure the energy needs of the community to be met; to maintain the safe, reliable, efficient energy at reasonable prices; to minimize the environmental impact of energy production and use; and to promote the efficient use and conservation of energy. It involves a wide range of complex and interrelated technical, economic and regulatory issues. A dynamic decision making model has been developed to cope with the requirements of the multimarket trading policy framework. Fuzzy Differential Evolution (FDE) algorithm is employed to solve the multi-period stochastic optimization problem and obtain the optimum results for each time interval. Policies defining the interactive markets can accurately reflect the intended goals such as decreasing emissions and promoting renewables.

AB  - In this paper, we build a framework to assess climate-change impacts on a power system. In order to appropriately capture the uncertainty of the climate change's multi-dimensional impacts, we argue that the multiple representative scenarios need to be set. Therefore, we developed a data-driven method to select representative scenarios instead of using the random-sampling method. We explain why the data-driven method is more appropriate for the research on the climate change than the random-sampling method. We adopt our framework to analyze an island nation's micro grid system. The research demonstrates that the climate change can significantly impacts this nation's electricity generation cost, energy security, and environmental performance.

AB  - The concept of circular economy (CE) is to an increasing extent treated as a solution to series of challenges such as waste generation, resource scarcity and sustaining economic benefits. Specific circumstances and motivations have stimulated ideas relevant to circularity in the past through activities such as Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, or Regeneration (4R). This study investigates a CE policy in an imperfect production system with Engineered-To-Order (ETO) component and general component. Keeping all these facts in mind, we propose a CE policy with the optimal production. Finally, we have illustrated our model by numerical example from the bike industry. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to obtain some managerial insights.

AB  - Energy efficiency is an important indicator of the economy of energy storage system, but related research mainly focuses on batteries, converters or energy storage units, and there is a lack of research on the actual energy efficiency of large energy storage system. In this paper, the energy efficiency is tested and analyzed for 20 energy storage system participating in frequency regulation ancillary in Guangdong Province. The results show that the energy efficiency of low power charge-discharge is generally better than that of high power charge-discharge, while the percentage of auxiliary energy consumption of low power and small capacity system is higher; the overall efficiency of energy storage system is affected by the system capacity, charge-discharge rate and auxiliary energy consumption.

AB  - This paper presents a study of the impact of EU battery regulations, specifically Regulation (EU) 2023/1542, on end-of-life batteries, primarily focusing on repurposing within the supply chain. Qualitative data was gathered from stakeholders in the battery supply chain using a combination of surveys and interviews. Interviews provide deeper insights into aspects beyond the survey’s scope, enhancing our understanding of how EU regulations influence the supply chain. The findings reveal a nuanced landscape where EU regulations bring advantages through defined producer responsibilities, improved safety standards, and facilitated data sharing. The study explores various circular business models within this context, emphasizing the need for a functional value network and effective stakeholder coordination. This research contributes valuable insights as the EU pursues circularity in the battery supply chain. By addressing barriers, capitalizing on opportunities, and promoting collaboration, it supports a sustainable and circular future in the EV battery supply chain, optimizing initial investments and aligning with the energy transition goals.

AB  - According to the sustainable development goals, ecoenvironmental quality (EEQ) assessment has become a key issue in response to global climate change. As a national pilot zone for ecological conservation and the free trade zone with a tropical coastal climate in China, Hainan is expected to present distinctive patterns in the ecoenvironment evolution. In this article, with multisource remote-sensing observations, we generated the long-term remote-sensing ecological index to interpret the spatiotemporal patterns and mechanisms for the diurnal and seasonal ecoenvironment, to detect the interaction between the urbanization and ecoenvironment, and to evaluate the development status of EEQ in Hainan. The results showed contrasting evolution of EEQ in the diurnal cycle, especially in the dry season. The improvement of daytime EEQ was primarily influenced by greenness, accounting for a 25% enhancement. On the other hand, the deterioration of nighttime EEQ was mainly driven by heat, explaining a 44% decline. Climate factors had a more significant impact on the evolution of EEQ compared with human activities’ factors. In addition, the mutual influence between the urbanization and ecoenvironment has been enhanced. Thus, the interaction between the contrasting evolution of EEQ and urbanization leads to the opposite development status of EEQ in the diurnal cycle, especially in urban area. Our findings imply that if the contrasting evolution of the ecoenvironment continues, the diurnal difference of the EEQ may be enhanced. The effective action to balance the diurnal difference is rooted in heat control within the context of urban development.

AB  - Scientific assessment of industrial energy efficiency will help explore the potential for energy efficiency improvement and optimize energy use methods. The existing energy efficiency evaluation in the industrial field mainly considers traditional energy efficiency evaluation indicators, which is difficult to meet the development trend of comprehensive customer-side energy efficiency services in energy transformation process. The evaluation dimensions are not clear enough on customer-side economic operation, safe energy use, low-carbon emission reduction, interactive response, etc. This article first analyzes the energy consumption data in the industrial field; then based on data analysis, it studies the development trend of energy use in the industrial field; facing the business needs of multiple types of energy efficiency services, it proposes a comprehensive and systematic energy efficiency comprehensive evaluation index system in the industrial field. This index system can help guide users to optimize energy use methods, fully tap the comprehensive energy-saving potential in the industrial field, and support safe power supply and green energy transformation. A fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method based on the analytic hierarchy process is proposed to solve the problem of comprehensive evaluation, and the feasibility of the evaluation method is verified through examples.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of sustainable development and climate change mitigation efforts by evaluating renewable energy technologies for reducing carbon emissions in residential buildings in Singapore. It begins with an extensive literature review, covering key initiatives such as the Green Mark scheme, household energy consumption patterns, and various government policies including the Carbon Tax, the Mandatory Energy Labeling Scheme (MELS), and the Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS). Additionally, it addresses the embodied carbon emissions associated with residential buildings. The study then examines the existing renewable energy technologies in Singapore, focusing on Solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems, Wind Turbines, Biomass Energy, and Energy Storage solutions. Using HOMER PRO software, the research evaluates these technologies in terms of data on efficiency, costs, Net Present Cost (NPC), and the number of batteries required, incorporating sensitivity data for different sizes of residential flats through Multiple Criteria Data Analysis. Simulations conducted with RETSCREEN software for both single-family homes and multi-unit housing take into account various factors such as weather patterns, energy consumption, and financial implications. These simulations provide a comprehensive assessment of the potential for these technologies to significantly reduce carbon emissions in residential buildings, aligning with Singapore's sustainability goals and contributing to global climate change mitigation efforts.

Then, we use the DEMATEL model to draw a causal relationship diagram and predict the goals for the next 10 years. Finally, the Grey Relational Grade ISD coupling model is used to obtain the development goal with the highest correlation degree with the Sustainable Development Goals. After assuming that the development goals with the highest correlation with the sustainable development goals are achieved, we analyse the relationship network diagram between the remaining SDGs and discuss the top three SDGs with the highest correlation. This paper implements a relationship network graph generated from 17 SDGs, and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the Grey Relational Grade, ISM model, and DEMATEL model, leaving room for further research.

AB  - The smart grid is widely recognized as a highly efficient solution for mitigating carbon emissions and addressing energy crises. Within this framework, the collection of metering data from users is crucial for improving energy efficiency. However, the frequent collection of real-time metering data presents substantial challenges in terms of data privacy and communication overhead. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure scheme that enables the system operator to monitor load and compute bills while preserving the users’ privacy. During the load monitoring phase, our scheme uses certificateless ring signatures and unique random identifiers to ensure the security of electricity data. Additionally, the proposed scheme uses improved function encryption for electricity data in a ciphertext state to protect users’ privacy during dynamic billing. Detailed security analysis demonstrates that our scheme meets the security requirements of the smart grid. Furthermore, we compare our scheme with existing schemes to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in terms of low computational complexity and communication overhead.

AB  - In the era of shifting toward greener and zero-emission energy production and transportation, Electrical Vehicles (EVs) gained substantial attention worldwide owing to their potentiality of the least carbon footprints on the environment. Nowadays, climate change is considered as the principal side effects of using fossil fuels and using conventional transportation systems. Considering the replacement of conventional plants with Renewable Energy (RE), the electrification of energy consumption is one of the key elements of the energy transition, due to the variability of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), and EVs are one of the main ways to increase it. Meanwhile, limited infrastructure for charging and maintenance has made us step forward in battery management, Battery Thermal Management Systems (BTMSs), and predictive maintenance for EVs to optimize energy efficiency, to have a range prediction over the distance these smart vehicles will commute. In this study, we had a comprehensive review of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Twins (DTs), and Metaverse into the EVs sector to anticipate the energy consumption behavior of electric machines and vital factors that affect their distance navigation. Having energy-related insights and also developing a road map for project owners to commence replacing traditional methods with cutting-edge optimizing technologies distinguishes this paper from other studies.

AB  - Building Information Modeling (BIM) is regarded as a potential vehicle to tremendously improve the information flow throughout the life cycle of a building. The integration of BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has potential to reduce the time for life cycle inventory, and at the same time, substantially improve the representativeness of the LCA results for the specific building design. The latter merit is not trivial. For instance, due to time limit, most building LCA studies estimate the building materials and fuels consumed in construction phase quite roughly, which excludes the choices on a wide range of construction techniques, materials, specialties and machines, no need to mention the energy consumption in operation phase, which is usually estimated in an even bolder manner. The roughness of the LCA practice undermines its credibility and hinders its application as a decision supporting tool for low carbon design. Currently, China's Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is undergoing a smart transformation, steered by the increased use of BIM. This paper presents a BIM-enabled LCA method and illustrates how the method can be used to facilitate the low carbon design under the circumstance of the smart AEC transition in China. A case study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building is conducted. In this study, various software tools and data sources are combined to enhance the data flow and interoperability between BIM models and LCA models. BIM tools are used to create the BIM model, calculate the inputs (materials, construction machines, energies, water and so on) of on-site construction process and simulate the energy consumption of building operation. The eBalance, a China's local LCA software tool is applied to build the LCA model. The Chinese Life Cycle Database is used as the main data source (72.73%) to calculate the carbon footprint of the given building while the Ecoinvent database and European Life Cycle Database act as supplementary. The results show that the carbon footprint of the building is 2993 kg CO2eq/m2. The operation phase contributes to 69% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, while the building material production contributes to 24%. Concrete is the most used building material, which accounts for 82% of mass but contributes to only 44% of the material related GHG emission. Although steel and aluminum account for only 2.6% and 1.4% of mass, they contribute to 28% and 17% GHG emission, respectively. Through BIM-enable LCA modeling, the potential life cycle environmental performance of the buildings can be assessed in detail. This makes the LCA not only more accessible but also more credible for the AEC professionals to use it as a guide for the low carbon design of buildings.

AB  - Traffic surveillance cameras are the eyes of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, they are currently isolated and can only extract information from each of their fixed views. To track vehicles across multiple cameras and help public agencies collect link travel time and speed information, an Edge-empowered Cooperative Multi-camera Sensing (ECoMS) System is proposed. ECoMS system presents a novel algorithmic and edge-server cooperative system construct to push edge computing and multi-camera re-identification workflow serving for traffic sensing based on Internet of Things (IoT) architecture. On the algorithm side, ECoMS system proposes a featherlight edge-based computer vision framework for vehicle detection, tracking, and features selection process in a real-time manner. Then, by only sending the objects’ representations to the server, the high-bandwidth data transmission and the heavy post-processing system can be abandoned. Furthermore, a hierarchical clip-based deep vehicle re-identification framework is proposed and integrated into the ECoMS system, and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by 4%–8% on Rank-1 accuracy. Finally, to balance the accuracy level of different camera pairs, a collaborative cross-camera traffic information estimation framework based on kernel density estimation with kernel smoother is implemented, which can get the precise link and region traffic information together with distributions (less than 1.01 KL distance). By maximizing the cooperation of the computational resources, orchestrating the data transmission and integrating road network graph features in the system, the ECoMS can precisely model the network-scale traffic information in a flexible, cost-effective, and scalable workflow. To the author’s best knowledge, ECoMS is the first multi-camera vehicle tracking and traffic monitoring system based on cooperative IoT architecture.

AB  - In exploring carbon neutrality and energy sustainability, little research addresses the seesaw effect between different pollutants. In real-world applications, efforts to reduce wastewater discharge may increase other types of pollution. To capture these substitution effects, we initially develop a theoretical model aimed at maximizing people’s welfare. Our framework extends the neoclassical model beyond the boundary of economics by incorporating energy and environmental constraints. Next, we empirically quantify this intricate interplay through structural equation modeling and explainable AI techniques, which are particularly effective in deconstructing complex systems and addressing multicollinearity. Also, we measure welfare using methodologies from public health and medical literature. Building on the theoretical framework and empirical analysis, we subsequently calculate the substitution elasticity of wastewater, dust, and sulfur dioxide relative to capital, demonstrating its heterogeneity across provinces. Our findings indicate that the substitution elasticity for reducing water pollution and dust by one percent are comparable, whereas mitigating sulfur dioxide proves to be more costly. Lastly, we find that practical plans for pollutant emissions and substitutions do not always align with their substitutability from the engineering perspective, as entrepreneurs tend to prioritize profit maximization over production efficiency. Since the considerations of technology developers and policy-makers are incorporated into the entrepreneurs' decisions, the generality of our analysis integrates the specificity of prior research.

AB  - Digital twin (DT) provides effective pathways to solve issues in the construction industry, particularly smart construction and carbon emissions in prefabrication. Past DT research explored facility management and fault detection, highlighting a knowledge gap on the use of DT for smart construction and emissions monitoring in prefabrication supply chain (PSC). Therefore, the aim of this study is to present a holistic view of DT applications in PSC by exploring real-time smart construction and carbon emissions monitoring. A mixed-method review was adopted in two-steps involving scientometric and qualitative analysis in this study. Findings from the scientometric analysis revealed high interest in research themes such as emissions and energy control, artificial intelligence-based decision-making and blockchain integration in DT for prefabrication. Furthermore, the findings from the qualitative analysis demonstrated how smart technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID), global positioning systems (GPS), laser scanners and sensors have been employed at the production, transportation, and on-site assembly stages of PSC for buildings. For real-time carbon emissions monitoring in DT, this study revealed various smart technologies and their corresponding information requirements for materials/components, machinery, and processes at each stage of the PSC. Five future research directions were provided on effective ways to advance DT in PSC for intelligent building processes and monitor emissions. Therefore, this study not only shows smart technologies suitable for DT in PSC, but also contributes to knowledge on using DT to monitor real-time carbon emissions in PSC for buildings. This study would aid researchers and practitioners with systemic approaches to employ when applying DT in PSC.

AB  - Membrane-based separation processes has been recently of significant global interest compared to other conventional separation approaches due to possessing undeniable advantages like superior performance, environmentally-benign nature and simplicity of application. Computational simulation of fluids has shown its undeniable role in modeling and simulation of numerous physical/chemical phenomena including chemical engineering, chemical reaction, aerodynamics, drug delivery and plasma physics. Definition of fluids can be occurred using the Navier–Stokes equations, but solving the equations remains an important challenge. In membrane-based separation processes, true perception of fluid’s manner through disparate membrane modules is an important concern, which has been significantly limited applying numerical/computational procedures such s computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Despite this noteworthy advantage, the optimization of membrane processes using CFD is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and CFD can result in the creation of a promising hybrid model to accurately predict the model results and appropriately optimize membrane processes and phase separation. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview about the advantages of commonly-employed ML-based techniques in combination with the CFD to intelligently increase the optimization accuracy and predict mass transfer and the unfavorable events (i.e., fouling) in various membrane processes. To reach this objective, four principal strategies of AI including SL, USL, SSL and ANN were explained and their advantages/disadvantages were discussed. Then after, prevalent ML-based algorithm for membrane-based separation processes. Finally, the application potential of AI techniques in different membrane processes (i.e., fouling control, desalination and wastewater treatment) were presented.

AB  - The current work investigated the possibility of employing chicken eggshell-zeolite composite as a cheap and recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for used cooking oil (UCO) conversion into its corresponding methyl ester (UCOME) via methanolysis process. Various catalysts were formulated by loading eggshell on the zeolite and calcined at different temperatures to obtain CaO incorporated zeolite (CaO-Zel) catalyst. The catalyst sample calcined at 800 °C for 4 h (CaO-Zel-800) exhibited best activity for methanolysis process and was analyzed using various techniques, including BET, surface basicity, TPD-CO2, TGA/DTA, SEM, XRD and FTIR. The transesterification process was modeled using artificial intelligence approach viz. artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) while optimization of the operating variables (temperature, catalyst loading, time and molar ratio) was performed by interfacing the developed models with ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. The closeness of coefficient of determination (R2) to unity and low mean square error (MSE) indicated that the methanolysis of UCO was adequately described by the developed models with ANFIS model (R2 = 0.9997 and MSE = 0.1271) superior to ANN model (R2 = 0.9953 and MSE = 2.0762). The highest UCOME yield of 99.45 ± 0.51 wt% was achieved with ANFIS-ACO under the condition; reaction temperature (72.97 °C), methanol/UCO molar ratio (7.14:1), reaction time (131.97 min) and catalyst dosage (5.39 wt%). The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that all the operating variables influence UCOME yield, and none could be discarded. The CaO-Zel-800 catalyst was reused for five consecutive reaction cycles, and its activity only decreased by about 12%.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks are responsible for sensing, gathering and processing the information of the objects in the network coverage area. Basic data fusion technology generally does not provide data privacy protection mechanism, and the privacy protection mechanism in health care, military reconnaissance, smart home and other areas of the application is usually indispensable. In this paper, we consider the privacy, confidentiality, and the accuracy of fusion results, and propose a data fusion algorithm for privacy preserving. This algorithm relies on the characteristics of data fusion, and uses the method of pre-distribution random number in the node to get the privacy protection requirements of the original data. Theoretical analysis shows that the malicious attacker attempts to steal the difficulty of node privacy in PPND algorithm. At the same time in the TOSSIM simulation results also show that, compared with TAG, SMART algorithm, PPND algorithm in the data traffic, the convergence accuracy of the good performance.

Employing fixed effect panel analysis, it is found that GDP as a proxy of economic performance has a significant and positive association with renewable energy, transportation, advanced technologies, and energy efficiency. It is implied that renewable energy consumption and energy efficiency factors enhance resource utilization and reduce economic costs, which ultimately helps countries boost their economic performance. Moreover, it is also argued that efficient transportation and innovative technologies promote renewable energy usage and a green economy. Hence, these factors help countries to achieve economic goals and protect the environment.

AB  - Currently, the conventional mode of power data transaction is mediated by Web pages. Nevertheless, there are challenging issues such as privacy protection, transaction security and data reliability in power data trading. In this paper, we present a novel secure power data trading scheme (SPDTS). Firstly, the zero-knowledge proof is employed to achieve data availability and consistency without revealing the data. Then, SPDTS takes full advantage of the dispersibility and immutability of blockchain to ensure the reliability of data transactions. To keep the transaction process efficient, the processing tasks for power data are performed under smart contract. Meanwhile, a trusted execution environment (TEE) is adopted to guarantee the security of power data. Finally, we present a differential privacy scheme to safeguard the privacy information in the power data. Our study indicates that the proposed scheme can achieve privacy protection, transaction security and data reliability. Also, we conduct security analysis and verify the privacy protection property of the scheme in real cases.

AB  - Privacy preservation and low-cost data processing have become two critical issues in the era of Internet of Things (IoT) due to the widespread deployment of lightweight smart surveillance and sensors. In this article, we propose a multitiered reversible data privacy preservation system based on compressive sensing (CS) and watermarking. The system anonymizes the region of interest (ROI) using an obfuscation matrix while compressing and encrypting the entire document. CS provides the first-tier encryption for data documents, and the obfuscation matrix provides the second-tier encryption for sensitive parts of data documents. The system offers a multitiered privacy protection scheme where restricted-authorized users can only access nonsensitive data while fully authorized users can access the entire document. To implement the reversible elimination of the obfuscation matrix, two watermark embedding methodologies are proposed in the CS domain in order. In both methods, the watermark generated by the obfuscation matrix is embedded in the encrypted CS measurement values, with the first methodology concentrating on the optimal data reconstruction quality and the second methodology working to balance storage space and data restoration quality. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed methodologies over other conventional reversible data privacy preservation schemes.

AB  - Industry 5.0 vision, a step toward the next industrial revolution and enhancement to Industry 4.0, conceives the new goals of resilient, sustainable, and human-centric approaches in diverse emerging applications such as factories-of-the-future and digital society. The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.

AB  - In recent years, with the development of data centers toward high heat flux density, traditional air-cooled has gradually failed to meet the cooling requirements. So the liquid cooling for data centers is an important area for future development, and current research focuses on developing efficient heat sink structures or constructing energy-saving cold source schemes. However, to-date, there has been no integration of these two facets and consequently current results are limited by a lack of comprehensive analysis of the entire cooling system. Consequently, liquid cooling for data centers was developed in this study, and a comprehensive thermal management performance analysis was conducted, including a heat sink and cold source. A minimum energy consumption analysis was performed to determine an optimal thermal management strategy by constructing a 4.8 kW data center cooling system, containing 400 W for each chip, with the aid of TRNSYS software. Taking 70 °C as the safe temperature for the chips, the power consumption of pumps and an air-cooled chiller were explored by analyzing the internal relationships between server inlet temperature, chiller supply water temperature, ambient temperature, and rates of water flow; and optimal thermal management was achieved. In addition, the corresponding fitted correlations for the optimal rates of water flow for different chiller supply water temperatures, are provided to guide the optimal design of cooling systems.

AB  - The limited resources of fossil fuels and bio energies, along with the environmental pollution caused by their combustion, make it necessary to search for renewable and clean alternative sources and to optimize the available current energies specifically for required energy for using in buildings. This is mandatory for a solution of future energy production issues as huge consumption of energy in buildings and structures is unavoidable in buildings for instance China's higher education buildings consume huge amounts of bioenergy. Most of the attention in the production of biofuel has been focused on the use of plant biomass, agricultural waste, solid waste, and sewage treatment sludge. Today, there are renewable resources to replace fossil fuels such as biofuels for usage in buildings required energy; however, in the last decade, the cultivation of microalgae has been proposed as another option for biomass production. Utilization of algae biomass is more cost-effective than vegetable crops in terms of water consumption and cultivated area and reduces costs and greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels. Artificial intelligence is a tool to help for this utilization and becoming much better in recent researches. Many types of microalgae, due to their high ability to consume organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, can grow in different water environments, including urban, industrial, agricultural wastewaters, and wastewaters containing animal waste, which contain large amounts of organic and inorganic carbon. There are nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements that act as a biological filter that with extensive studies and inventing new methods, cost-effective production of algae-biofuels can be achieved. This review goals to run over the latest innovations and artificial intelligence approaches for biohydrogen generation from algal towards sustainable energy optimization and greener environment for buildings required energy. The current state of the art, existing and upcoming challenges, latest technologies, and solutions to overcome existing limitation are presented in details.

AB  - ABSTRACT Background Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is an important imaging modality for the assessment of heart disease; however, limitations of CMR include long exam times and high complexity compared to other cardiac imaging modalities. Recently advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have shown great potential to address many CMR limitations. While the developments are remarkable, translation of AI-based methods into real-world CMR clinical practice remains at a nascent stage and much work lies ahead to realize the full potential of AI for CMR. Methods Herein we review recent cutting-edge and representative examples demonstrating how AI can advance CMR in areas such as exam planning, accelerated image reconstruction, post-processing, quality control, classification and diagnosis.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has showed powerful capacity in detecting and diagnosing faults of building energy systems. This paper aims at making a comprehensive literature review of artificial intelligence-based fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods for building energy systems in the past twenty years from 1998 to 2018, summarizing the strengths and shortcomings of the existing artificial intelligence-based methods, and revealing the most important research tasks in the future. Challenges in developing FDD methods for building energy systems are discussed firstly. Then, a comprehensive literature review is made. All methods are classified into two categories, i.e. data driven-based and knowledge driven-based. The data driven-based methods are abundant, including the classification-based, unsupervised learning-based and regression-based. They showed powerful capacity in learning patterns from training data. But, they need a large amount of training data, and have problems in reliability and robustness. The knowledge driven-based methods show powerful capacity in simulating the diagnostic thinking of experts. But, they rely on expert knowledge heavily. It is concluded that new artificial intelligence-based methodologies are needed to be able to combine the advantages of both kinds of methods in the future.

AB  - With the rapid development of machine learning, it has been applied to solve various problems in social life because of its unique advantages. To address the current new energy consumption prediction and access planning methods of peak shifting capacity is insufficient. Particle swarm optimisation algorithm and mixed integer linear programming algorithm are proposed and applied to the models of new energy consumption prediction and photovoltaic access planning respectively. The new energy consumption prediction model based on particle swarm optimisation is applied for comparative analysis, and the results show that its average prediction accuracy and precision rate are 94.7% and 95.8%, respectively, which are significantly better than the comparison model. The mixed-integer linear programming-based PV access model is used for comparative analysis, and the results show that it is significantly better than the comparison model in terms of comprehensive cost and PV access volume dimensions, which is practical. The above results show that the two models proposed in the study have good performance and practicality, which are conducive to maximising the consumption of new energy and saving costs.

AB  - Smart home applications require automatic energy management and control of unwanted energy consumption prices using Artificial intelligence techniques. Previously, there were more studies on price forecasting. However, efficient results are still under research. This study introduces real-time residential energy management systems based on the Internet of Energy with a scheduling strategy. The proposed method employs a Gated Recurrent Unit and Bird Swarm Optimizer (GRU-BSO) along with Real-Time Electricity Scheduling (RTES) based on Price Forecasting (PF) for efficient residential energy management. The research emphasises the optimisation algorithm’s ability to minimise energy costs and promote energy conservation, significantly contributing to the field. Price forecasting (PF) is the central objective in distributed energy production. By forecasting the optimal price, this approach can improve the efficiency of power grids and solve issues with microgrid management and planning. It is suggested that the tariffs for shoulder-peak and on-peak hours be determined using the Time of Use (ToU) model. The proposed method also predicts the energy price used in home energy management. The cloud server and MATLAB-implemented microgrid system are linked via a two-level communications network. The current communications level uses the local communication level as a protocol, which uses IP/TCP and MQTT. The study’s proposed scheduling controller successfully achieved energy savings of 17 kW and 47 cents by utilising the proposed method.

AB  - Free cooling is regarded as the most effective way to reduce the energy consumption of the cooling system in data centers. This study proposes a novel water-medium indirect evaporative cooling (IEC) chiller used in a data center to achieve free cooling throughout the year as an alternative to electrical chillers. Field tests and numerical modeling of the IEC water chillers are both reported to evaluate the performance and efficiency. This paper first-time reports on the application of IEC water chillers to deliver year-round free cooling for a data center in Changji, China. The wet-bulb efficiency of the tested chiller is measured as 120% to 152.8% and the dew-point efficiency is 27% to 62.7%. A numerical model is established to verify the operating conditions, and some common operational optimizations are pointed out in this test for energy savings. PUE can be reduced to 1.212 after the optimization. More future performance predictions of the IEC water chillers are studied when the data center load rate increases and when the local weather changes in a year to discuss the year-round availability. For further study, the performance of IEC water chillers in different climate regions is also forecasted. The results indicate that it’s an effective way for IEC to achieve free cooling in regions where natural cold resources are abundant. In this study, the field test performance and prediction of IEC water chillers are provided as a typical and practical application as the natural cooling source in data centers in hot and dry areas.

AB  - With the serious threat of global climate change and the increasing demand for sustainable energy sources, the renewable and clean nature of new energy sources (such as wind and solar energy) has attracted widespread attention. However, the instability and unpredictability of new energy sources pose a significant challenge to the operation and planning of the power system. In this study, a new energy consumption optimization algorithm and model based on demand side response is proposed to realize the efficient consumption of sustainable energy and the stable operation of power system. In this study, a power system model includes traditional generating sets, wind power and solar power station. Then, demand side response is introduced as a key flexibility resource to adjust power demand to achieve more efficient consumption of new energy. The availability of the demand-side response is monitored and controlled through smart meters and smart home devices, enabling the power system to respond more flexibly to new energy fluctuations. In order to realize optimal consumption, this study proposes a multi-objective optimization algorithm to maximize the utilization of new energy, minimize the operating cost of the power system and ensure the stability of the power system. The algorithm takes into account the spatial-temporal characteristics of new energy and the potential of demand side response, and optimizes the operation of the power system through collaborative dispatching. This study verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and model through simulation experiments on real power system datasets. The results show that the new energy absorption strategy based on demand-side response can not only significantly reduce carbon emissions, but also reduce the operating cost of the power system and improve the reliability of the system.

AB  - Industrial Seedling Raising (ISR) is increasingly becoming an important part of Modern Agriculture because of its efficient utilization of land, water, and fertilizer as well as its advantages of being not easily affected by the weather. However, the high cost and high energy consumption of light sources for plant growth is limiting the popularization of ISR technology. Phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (pc-LEDs) make use of relatively affordable red phosphor and blue light chips, providing an adjustable spectrum to optimize plant growth. To identify the energy-saving light quality of pc-LEDs, we investigated the effects of a variety of light qualities on the growth of tobacco seedlings. Y3Al5O12:Ce3+, CaAlSiN3:Eu2+, KAl11O17:Eu2+ phosphors were combined with the blue light chip according to different proportions to produce the following light sources: CK (white light), T1 (blue light), T2 (red light), T3 (red: blue light ratio = 1:4), T4 (red: blue light ratio = 4:1). The tobacco variety Xiangyan7 grown continuously under T1, T2, T3, and T4 significantly increased the leaf area, stem length, biomass, root area and main root length compared with those grown under white light. Among the five kinds of light qualities tested, T4 treatment exerted the best effect on leaf development and biomass increase, while T2 exerted the best effect on stem elongation. The cytological analysis demonstrated that the promotion of the cell size and cell number of leaf epidermal cells by T1-T4 might contribute to the leaf expansion. Further analysis at the molecular level suggested that the light quality affected the RNA levels of the genes involved in cell division and expansion. When tobacco seedlings reached the same biomass, T1-T4 light sources saved 71%, 86%, 80% and 89% of electric energy respectively compared with white light. Therefore, the application of specific pc-LEDs not only reduces the cost of light source production, but also saves energy consumption, offering great potential for ISR technology to cut costs and increase efficiency.

AB  - Digital transformation has the potential to significantly impact household energy consumption (HEC) by promoting the adoption of energy-efficient technologies. This paper utilizes the time-varying Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to evaluate the causal effect of digital transformation on HEC within China's households. We find that HEC is positively impacted by digital transformation, as embodied by the "Broadband China" strategy; and the results remain reliable when many robustness tests are taken into account. Specifically, digital transformation has the potential to indirectly increase HEC by consumption upgrade and internet development mechanisms. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of digital transformation on HEC varies significantly across different household and regional. High-income, low skilled, rural areas, as well as households in areas with higher levels of development and marketization, are more likely to be affected by the digital revolution in production and consumption, which will inevitably lead to an increase in HEC. These insights are crucial for developing effective strategies to reduce HEC and promote sustainable development.

AB  - The current base station management faces challenges such as imprecise information perception, a lack of precise prediction techniques for load and energy consumption, and the absence of refined optimization methods for multi-source comprehensive scheduling. It can only achieve a quantitative complementarity of energy on the supply side, the grid side, and the load side, without considering the differences in energy quality of various forms of energy and their optimal scheduling in conversion, transmission, storage, and utilization. Simultaneously, there is a severe deficiency in cross-temporal and spatial allocation and utilization of energy, as well as the use of edge computing and big data analytics for precise prediction and optimization scheduling. This has resulted in low overall energy utilization efficiency, high carbon emissions, and other issues. There is an urgent need to break through the key technologies of accurate perception, precise prediction, precise scheduling, and fine control in the energy Internet of Things system for base stations. The project team has put forth a scientifically sound solution, addressing issues related to precise perception of base station status, accurate load prediction, fine optimization of energy management, and precise control of comprehensive energy systems. They have proposed the "Uncertain Data Processing Algorithm for Base Station Energy Consumption" to tackle and solve the challenge of precise load prediction in energy IoT based on high-noise, low-quality data.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goal 7 emphasizes the need for affordable and sustainable modern energy. Wood-fuel is not a significant part of debates surrounding this goal despite its importance as a major energy source in developing countries. Policies concentrate on alternative sources of fuels, but these are often expensive to a majority of the populations in developing countries. This is coupled in some areas with charcoal bans as well as tough restrictions on wood fuel harvest in forests. This disproportionately affects the poor segment of the community who are not able to afford alternative sources of energy. More attention should be focused on biomass fuels such as wood fuel to make them renewable sources. This can be done through community-based forest management. The Plantation Establishment and Livelihood Improvement Scheme (PELIS) in Kenya is practiced through Participatory Forest Management (PFM) where forest adjacent communities are allocated forest land for three years where they grow trees and food crops. This scheme can be utilized for sustainable charcoal production by setting aside a piece of the land for growing trees suitable for charcoal production. This would provide the communities with viable sources of energy as well as income through the sale of wood fuel. There is potential in utilizing existing community-based management institutions to implement sustainable wood fuel production strategies. This will contribute to bridging the gap between wood fuel demand and supply, as well as complement livelihoods.
