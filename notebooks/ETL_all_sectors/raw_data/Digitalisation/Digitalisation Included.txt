AB  - E-waste policies and regulations form the basis of E-waste management in a country. The evolution of policy and regulatory regime in this context is driven by a number of drivers both at local and international level. In this context, analysis of the existing policy and regulations and emergence of future trends has been carried out for E-waste management in India. Further, major drivers, which are expected to form basic elements for development, institutionalization and implementation of future regulatory interventions have been identified.

AB  - The domain of smart home environments is viewed as a key element of the future Internet, and many homes are becoming “smarter” by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to improve home security, energy efficiency and comfort. At the same time, enforcing privacy in IoT environments has been identified as one of the main barriers for realizing the vision of the smart home. Based on the results of a risk analysis of a smart home automation system developed in collaboration with leading industrial actors, we outline the first steps towards a general model of privacy and security for smart homes. As such, it is envisioned as support for enforcing system security and enhancing user privacy, and it can thus help to further realize the potential in smart home environments.

AB  - Discussions in Latvia are ongoing regarding the optimum solution to implementing Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency. This study analyses a scenario where a significant fraction of target energy efficiency is achieved by obliging energy utilities to implement user-end energy efficiency measures. Investment related costs are likely to be included in the energy prices and service tariffs therefore gains for the users are under question. The authors analyze ways to achieve a balance between user gains from energy end-use savings and increased energy prices and tariffs as a result of obligations imposed upon energy utilities including the energy supply sectors where supply tariffs are regulated. Authors also have assessed the disadvantages of the current Latvian district heating regulation and have marked the next steps for a transition from hard regulation towards the approximation of benchmarking and market principles.

AB  - After decades of developing corporate sustainability in Taiwan, the ICT sector has assumed the most important role in promoting corporate sustainability. Of the 13 corporations in the DJSI, nine are in the ICT sector. The corporate sustainability programs of such companies should be reevaluated in terms of their contributions to global sustainable development. This study analyzes whether the practices of Taiwanese ICT firms truly respond to global sustainability trends. This study is divided into two parts. First, an evaluating framework based on SDGs is developed using the documents published by SDG Compass and SDG Industry Matrix. The framework is identified from the aforementioned analysis, followed by the application of context analysis. The 9 corporate sustainability reports published by Taiwanese ICT sector firms of DJSI members in 2015 and 2016 are selected from the CSRone platform, which is a local database for sustainability reports in Taiwan. The sustainable actions in the 9 sustainability reports are subsequently assessed by the evaluating framework to demonstrate the corporations' efforts in responding to global sustainable goals. The outcomes of this research provide Taiwanese ICT sector firms with a broad understanding of global sustainable trends and integrate novel concepts into the decision-making process. This study also improves the sustainability of corporate activities or projects for the benefit of global citizens.

AB  - Due to the ever-increasing consumption of resources, various materials and raw materials have become increasingly scarce and consequently expensive. At the same time, energy demand has dramatically increased in global mining operations also intensifying economic pressure. Surprisingly, the recapturing of important raw materials at the end of the product life cycle through recycling is still insufficiently implemented in the supply chain. Recycling is not only a sink for unwanted materials it can become an urban mine. This is especially relevant in Europe, where in comparison to other continents primary raw material mining of bulk materials is rather low. In a situation of scarcity, the exact planning of raw material and material flows for the following months (and sometimes years) has become ever more vital to ensure their timely and sufficient availability for production. A missing piece is the necessary transfer of production information (like bill of materials, BOM) to the recycler because information is typically kept inside the production supply chain. Digital technologies such as Digital Twins can help provide this information to the End-of-Life (EoL) stakeholders (recycling industry) as a means to increase the potential of circular economy. This paper establishes urban mining as an important concept of life cycle management in the circular economy. It uses a case study approach to explore the potential of urban mining for resource savings. The authors demonstrate that urban mining represents a high-impact application of sustainable engineering within life cycle management where Digital Twins help increase impact on sustainability.

AB  - Passing to a new era, the era of Smart and Sustainable Cities (SSC), has been widely related with the development of 5G networks in a mass scale. It is not only a matter of academic research but moreover a matter of successful implementation in order to achieve wide usage from the public and sustainable revenues for the companies. While the concept and the applications of SSC is widening, the more important the role of 5G networks seem to be. Current paper investigates the transformation of a city to a smart and sustainable city (SSC) as an opportunity for facilitating the deployment of 5G via sharing of infrastructures and as a factor of increasing demand for services. 5G is presented as an end-to-end communication system enabling a smart interconnected city with new business models evolving a variety of partners. Also, the variety of the partners and the stakeholders are presented, and the role of regulation is indicated for the implementation of SSC and 5G projects.

AB  - With our increasing reliance on technology, the amount of e-waste generated after their life cycle ends is increasing at an exponential rate. Going by this rate, we'll have an equivalent amount of carbon footprint as the transportation industry, only by the smartphone segment by 2035. We can imagine the total carbon footprint if we extend this to all the other numerous electronic gadgets we use. With the increasing volume of e-waste, the chances of these toxic non-biodegradable elements polluting the environment are astronomical. This problem is being addressed by various nations and laws to regulate the waste have been passed in recent years. The Indian Government has placed E-Waste (Management and Handling) Rules in 2011 which forms a part of the Environment Protection Act to ensure coherent disposal of e-waste. However, a rather large percentage of e-waste in India is still not regulated and it runs vastly by unorganized sectors. We provide a solution to the above problem by proposing an efficient e-waste management technique by using blockchain in the 5G scenario. Our solution keeps track of the e-waste generated and we provide an incentive-based system where users are encouraged to channelize their e-waste through government regulated agencies which efficiently dispose of them in an environment-friendly manner. We propose a public-private partnership (PPP) model for implementing this, which can generate thousands of jobs by organizing this unregulated sector with huge underlying potential.

Everyday life is now intertwined with digital tools and platforms such as mobile (smart) phones, high-powered personal computers, cyber-physical gadgets, etc. These tools rely on data centers. In the modern digital society, the concept of sustainable development includes energy-efficient, energy waste recovery, and climate aware process of digitization. Modern and digital power system operations would rely more on the data centers. This is a conceptual paper that discusses socio-techno-economic aspects to better utilize the data centers in a sustainable way. Broad guidelines are provided on the key features to be considered to build novel decision-support system tools for the optimal integration of data centers within power systems.

AB  - This paper provides details on a case study conducted into the upcycling of e-waste. E-waste is a global problem that is becoming an increasing burden on low-to-middle income countries. These low-to-middle income countries are the recipients of large volumes of e-waste per annum from higher income countries. In certain countries, precious metals are extracted from e-waste, however, this only marginally reduces the stockpiles of waste material, rendering much of it unusable. The objectives of this paper are to highlight the feasibility of re-engineering and upcycling e-waste as a workable route to waste management, using robotics as an example application area. Our methods included sourcing e-waste, identifying and isolating different usable parts from the waste, and re-engineering these into a flexible end effector with complete, coupled, rotational and translational freedom. We further develop active alternative control systems with passive elastic recovery. Our work shows there is feasibility in re-engineering e-waste to manufacture functional electro-mechanical products and devices, and that upcycling e-waste in this way is a step towards responsible e-waste management through engineering knowledge and practice. Our work also highlights some of the impracticalities and challenges involved in e-waste upcycling.

AB  - Improving the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) is of paramount importance, given the impact of AFSC on the survival of mankind and of the planet. Data analytics, and the digital technologies supporting collection and analysis of the (big) data produced within and outside AFSCs, represent potentially powerful tools to improve such sustainability. However, how these new technologies can support AFSCs in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations is still under-explored. This paper aims, through a systematic literature review, to provide an answer to such question. To this goal, 50 papers were analysed. Results suggest that digital technologies can support ASFCs in reaching SDGs by supporting real time monitoring, sharing of data across the supply chains, improving decision making by performing scenario analyses and by enabling automation of some activities. These contributions call for the building of a Decision Support System for AFSCs. Finally, directions for future research are presented.

AB  - There is an exponential increase in research seeking sustainability in the supply chain design since 2010, emerging the called sustainable supply chain design (SSCD). Furthermore, new approaches consider sustainability integrates governmental and technological aspects to the classic assessment including economic, environmental, and social dimensions. This research tendency has implied a broad and diverse set of metrics and resolution method approaches to address each sustainability dimension in the search for an optimal design. This implies new significant problems to be considered. It implies several possible metrics combinations for the SSCD since there is no agreement among researchers on which metrics represent better, or to a greater extent, each sustainability dimension sustainability and even how to depict the concept of sustainability itself in the supply chain design. Considering the new approaches and social dimension is underrepresented in the majority of literature cases, we want to contribute the understanding of how social, governmental, and technological dimensions have been assessed in optimal SSCD. Our proposal is based on an extensive literature review from a total of 541 analyzed articles, which allows us to represent and identify the different metrics. We distinguish nineteen metrics from the different sustainability dimensions.

AB  - In their transition to smart cities, an increasing number of cities are pursuing strategies to improve efficiency of transport. One strategy is to achieve smart mobility, for which cities implement intelligent transport systems (ITS). Simultaneously, municipalities recognize their responsibility for creating a sustainable environment for citizens in the face of challenges like overpopulation, land shortage, and climate change. Interestingly, many ITS initiatives mainly focus on technical outcomes and overlook their impact on sustainability despite its key benefit for smart mobility. To fill this gap, we develop a framework for assessing the sustainability impact of ITS initiatives in this paper. We analyze the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations and relate them to various concepts of ITS to derive our framework. Thereby, our work bridges two fundamental perspectives for further research and supports decision-makers in choosing ITS initiatives that contribute to both smart mobility and sustainability.

AB  - In a broader sense, the term “green computing” refers to techniques and guidelines for creating, utilizing, and decommissioning computer resources in a way that is ecologically beneficial while still preserving overall computing performance. To do this, it is necessary to utilize less hazardous materials, use products as efficiently as possible while using the least amount of energy, and increase the reusability, recyclable content, and biodegradability of trash. Many businesses are making efforts to lessen the negative effects of their activities on the environment. An international environmental treaty known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) aims to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere at a level that would stop harmful anthropogenic interference with the eco system. Sustainable development entails growth that doesn't jeopardize the needs of coming generations. It is achieving human development goals while protecting the ecosystems and natural resources that are essential to society. The importance of green computing for sustainable development is emphasized in this paper's assessment of several significant recent studies in the subject. The use of computers and other computing devices in ways that are both energy-efficient and ecologically friendly is known as green computing also referred to as green technology. Energy-efficient servers, peripherals, power systems, and central processing units (CPUs) are frequently used in green computing firms. They underline the necessity of conserving resources and properly disposing of physical and electronic trash (e-waste).

AB  - Under the "dual carbon" goal, the large-scale grid connection of new energy poses great challenges to the safety and reliability of the power system. Faced with the goal of sustained growth in new energy, whether the carrying capacity of the power grid can meet the requirements, and how to evaluate the new energy consumption capacity have become key issues currently faced. In order to fully tap into the new energy consumption capacity of the power grid, improve computational efficiency and accuracy, this article first constructs an evaluation model for the new energy consumption capacity of the power grid; Then, taking into account the internal and external units of the target power grid, a new energy consumption capacity evaluation method based on unit regulation capacity constraints is proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed evaluation method can effectively evaluate the new energy consumption capacity of the power grid while ensuring the security constraints of the power grid.

AB  - One of the seventeen goals of sustainable development is responsible consumption and production. Lighting is one of the major consumers of electricity. Smart lighting can enhance energy efficiency and cut down on the wastage of electric energy. One such way to smart lighting is to use the smart lighting app to control switching actions with ease. Moreover, the adoption of these apps is determined by user satisfaction. Thus, the smart lighting app ‘Philips Hue’ was chosen to investigate user satisfaction with such an app. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), this study proposes nine e-satisfaction determinants of smart lightning apps. The dominance analysis showed update, device connection, and smart hue experiences are major determinants of user satisfaction with the smart lightning app. Smart hue experience is rated 5 based on correspondence analysis, whereas update and device connection are rated 1.

AB  - The need of taking concrete actions for a Europe’s Green Transition is evident, and in this direction clear objectives have been set through the European Green Deal. In this context, quantifiable and tailored information is needed to allow conscious decisions and support advocacy. Space datasets and tools enabling their processing represent empowering solutions for delivering suitable actionable information; however, in several cases this potential has not been fully exploited yet, or not completely understood or even known. The Space for a Green Future (S4GF) Accelerator, one of the three thematic areas identified by the European Space Agency (ESA) in need for action to accelerate the use of space for solving wider societal issues, precisely addresses this objective. Here we describe the Green Transition Information Factories (GTIF) element, which has been developed to provide interactive tools enabling conscious use of data and tools in support to decision making. Specific attention is given to Sustainable Cities enablers, since urban planning plays a pivotal role in bridging the Green Transition.

AB  - As we move into the digital era, there is a pressing need for the correct management of e-waste. Nevertheless, firms are more concerned with increasing profits than with upgrading and recycling obsolete gadgets. Due to a trade-off between security performance and recycling costs, even the most recent version of the software does not support older devices. E-Waste is a broad and expanding category of electronic garbage that includes big residential products such as abandoned refrigerators, air conditioners, mobile phones, mobile stereos, consumer electronics, and Computers. Electronic equipment contains thousands of harmful metals and compounds, including chromium, lead, phthalates, cadmium, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), beryllium, antimony, brominated flame retardants, and mercury, making it substantially more hazardous than other municipal wastes. These substances cause damage to the nervous, renal, skeletal, reproductive, and endocrine systems after prolonged exposure. Few of these chemicals are neurotoxic and cancer-causing.

AB  - In 2015, more than 150 world leaders formally approved the plan called Transforming Our World: 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development until 2030. Climate action is a global goal for our lives to be sustainable. For responsible investors, public companies are to be required to disclose the information based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, strongly focusing on risks and opportunities related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy. To promote adaptation and mitigation for climate change, not merely depending on voluntary efforts by companies, an entrepreneur’s creative ideas should be leveraged. ESG entrepreneurs, who are augmented by digital technologies, are expected to challenge other SDGs such as biodiversity in addition to deriving the energy source transition. To encourage social entrepreneurship, this paper proposes a data-driven framework for entrepreneurs executing technology transition. In this framework, the sustainability-related disclosed information, which is mainly targeted at investors, is integrated with complementary information unique to local communities. This paper analyses the benefits of this proposal by applying it to a previous renewable energy field project which faced difficulties in improving profitability.

AB  - Renewable energy significantly reduces carbon emis- sions, combats climate change, and paves the way for a sustainable future for generations to come. In alignment with other countries' efforts towards climate change mitigation and sustainability, Denmark is committed to achieving a 70% reduction in emissions by 2030 and ultimately reaching zero emissions by 2050 within its borders. While solar and wind power are the primary sources of renewable energy, their intermittent nature poses challenges when energy demand is high. Consequently, energy storage emerges as a critical concern. To address this, sector coupling and an efficient energy trading system are pivotal, as they interconnect energy- consuming sectors with power-producing sectors to maximize the efficient utilization of renewable energy. This paper delves into the potential benefits of integrating digital twin and blockchain technology into renewable energy trading and sector coupling.

AB  - This paper explores the potential of leveraging data science to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data. The SDGs are 17 interrelated goals designed to promote sustainable development and eradicate poverty. The paper discusses how data science techniques can be applied to each of the 17 SDGs and also mentions the role of AI in achieving the SDGs. While data science presents a tremendous opportunity to advance the SDGs, it poses challenges like data privacy or quality. The paper reviews several examples of how data science has been used to address specific SDGs, such as ending hunger, promoting health and well-being, and reducing inequalities. The paper also discusses some of the challenges and opportunities for leveraging data science in the context of the SDGs, including issues related to data quality, privacy, and equity. Overall, the paper argues that data science has the potential to be a powerful tool for advancing the SDGs, but that careful attention must be paid to the ethical and social implications of data-driven approaches.

AB  - Industry 4.0 requires digital twins (DTs), a potential technology in the transition. By offering current operational statistics visualizations of physical assets, assisting in decision-making, and mitigating possible hazards in electronic manufacturing environments, DTs are essential to the improvement of distributed consumer electronics. DTs must also work with blockchain technology in dispersed consumer electronics systems to anticipate data privacy and access control. Unfortunately, the single failure of DT collaboration is caused by centralized attacks and data interoperability, authentication, scalability, and connectivity issues. This paper provides the secure architecture for the DTs’ collaboration in consumer electronic devices. Next, we have created an access control mechanism based on a consensus model that combines blockchain, digital twin, and real-time monitoring of consumer devices. The proposed framework uses blockchain technology to empower digital twin-based consumer electronic devices. Specifically, we created a collaborative blockchain architecture based on manufacturer, retailer, and device users, emphasizing a distributed chain code model and real-time access control. The experimental results show that the proposed system integration performs better than the baseline digital twin architecture.

AB  - The emergence of the sustainable development has encouraged manufacturers and scientific researchers to adopt new economic models such as the “circular economy”. This new strategy targets the efficient and sustainable management of resources as well as the reduction and elimination of waste. Researches on circularity in business models has recently increased but few researchers have studied the link between sustainability and circular economy in the context of Industry 4.0. To fill this gap, this paper conducts a bibliometric analysis to identify and discuss the existing literature. This review, based on the Scopus database, identified a literature survey of 77 documents published from 2017 to 2023. The paper begins by defining the different concepts related to our studies. Thereafter, it highlights our research methodology steps, followed by descriptive analysis. The findings indicate that there is a clear orientation of sustainability to improve manufacturing system and supply chain management throughout the product life cycle. Also, the industry 4.0 technologies are necessary to implement the circular economy strategies. Thus, organizations will be able to build a cleaner-intelligent processes.

AB  - Addressing the challenges of climate change on agriculture necessitates innovative approaches. This study introduces a Renewable Energy-based Smart Agriculture System (RESAS), a paradigm shift designed to enhance climate change predictions and assess their impacts on agriculture. Traditional agriculture systems (TAS) are limited by their dependency on non-renewable energy sources and lack of precision in climate impact forecasting. These limitations contribute to inefficient resource use and inadequate adaptation strategies to climatic changes. RESAS leverages solar and wind energy to power an array of sensors and IoT devices, facilitating real-time data acquisition and analysis. By incorporating AI algorithms for predictive analytics, RESAS outperforms TAS in forecasting climate-related agricultural impacts with greater accuracy and efficiency. Unlike TAS, which relies on historical data and manual interventions, RESAS offers a dynamic, datadriven approach, enabling proactive and precise agricultural management.

AB  - Sustainable development has emerged as a global priority, and industries are increasingly striving to align their operations with sustainable practices. Parallel machine scheduling (PMS) is a critical aspect of production planning that directly impacts resource utilization and operational efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the application of metaheuristic optimization algorithms to address the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem (UPMSP) through the lens of sustainable development goals (SDGs). The primary objective of this study is to explore how metaheuristic optimization algorithms can contribute to achieving sustainable development goals in the context of UPMSP. We examine a range of metaheuristic algorithms, including genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, and more, and assess their effectiveness in optimizing the scheduling problem at hand. The evaluation of the algorithms focuses on their ability to improve the optimization of job-to-machine assignments, enabling industries to efficiently minimize the overall makespan of scheduling tasks. This, in turn, leads to waste reduction and enhanced energy efficiency. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we consider UPMSP instances that incorporate sustainability-related constraints and objectives. We assess the algorithms’ performance in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, robustness, and scalability, while also examining their implications for sustainable resource allocation and environmental stewardship. The findings of this study provide insights into the efficacy of metaheuristic optimization algorithms for addressing UPMSP with a focus on sustainable development goals. By leveraging these algorithms, industries can optimize scheduling decisions to minimize waste and enhance energy efficiency. The practical implications of this research are valuable for decision-makers, production planners, and researchers seeking to achieve sustainable development goals in the context of unrelated parallel machine scheduling. By embracing metaheuristic optimization algorithms, businesses can optimize their scheduling processes while aligning with sustainable principles, leading to improved operational efficiency, cost savings, and a positive contribution to the global sustainability agenda.

AB  - The paper presents an approach towards optimizing energy management in industrial complexes using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and Digital Twin technologies, contributing to SDG 9 and SDG 11. Industrial complexes, characterized by diverse energy infrastructures including distributed energy resources (DERs), backup generators, combined heat and power systems, and energy storage units, face significant challenges in ensuring reliable and efficient energy supply while minimizing costs and emissions. To address these challenges, we employ the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm that enables decentralized decision-making for energy management. The Digital Twin of the industrial complex serves as a real-time simulation model, capturing dynamic changes in load demand, renewable generation levels, storage states, market prices, weather forecasts, and grid parameters. The proposed system utilizes a well-defined state space comprising this data to optimize the action space, which includes adjusting loads, scheduling generation units, controlling storage systems, and facilitating energy trading. A Unit Commitment Agent is developed to ensure reliable supply by effectively scheduling generation units. Furthermore, we propose strategies for effective economic dispatch aiming to reduce operational costs and enhance energy efficiency. The results demonstrate the potential of integrating RL and Digital Twin technologies to create smart, adaptive energy management systems that align with the goals of advancing industrial innovation, infrastructure, and sustainable urban development.

AB  - Tracking carbon emissions from both vehicles and humans is crucial for understanding and mitigating climate change. Accurate prediction models are essential to address the diverse nature of carbon emission datasets. An ensemble regression model combining Random Forest, CatBoost, and Deep Neural Networks has been proposed to effectively handle various types of datasets. Evaluations showed that the model achieved an $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ score of 99.717% on the CO2 Emission (Vehicles) dataset with a 70–30 train-test split and an $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ score of 98.425% on the Carbon Footprint (Humans) dataset with an 80–20 split. These results underscore the model's capability to provide robust and accurate predictions across different carbon emission contexts, enhancing environmental analytics.

AB  - The impact of climate change on the security and well-being of citizens is increasingly recognized as a threat multiplier, with consequences that can have a local, regional and global impact. A major consequence of this new security paradigm is the so-called Climate Security, which refers to how climate change related events amplify existing risks in society, endangering the safety of citizens, key infrastructures, economies or ecosystems. Earth Observation (EO) has long been regarded as a critical resource for understanding Climate Security scenarios. Together with technologies such as Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as the emergence of the Digital Twins concept, these technologies are providing a key framework for a holistic advanced analysis. The present work aims to present the European Union Satellite Centre (SatCen) approach to better understand Climate Security issues, displaying its different activities in Research and Innovation (R&I) as well as an example of an operational use case, where the construction of a water canal in the Amu Darya river basin could have significant consequences on the access to water for the whole region, leading to possible security concerns.

AB  - The economics of privacy examines the policy implications of the interaction between people's decisions to expose personal data and corporations' strategies for implementing innovation using this information. The law and policy program (D-DCRCLPP) of the data-to-decisions cooperative research center provides examples of the various ways that regulation affects the economy and, in turn, living standards. As a result, only a limited amount of capital, labor, and technology may be used in the production process. Regulation, when done incorrectly, has the potential to stifle innovation and learning while also limiting opportunities for everyone. Big Data technology (BDT) has been studied, with a focus on privacy and data protection techniques, which led to the formulation of this policy proposal based on privacy law (PL). Several perspectives are provided, each with benefits and weaknesses. These perspectives come from the domains of governance, law, economics, and information science. Enormous, linked, and information sharing are multifaceted ways that necessitate the use of a variety of technologies to promote and protect people's economic and political rights. Existing and emerging rules of international economic law have an indirect impact on such projects. New regulations for digital commerce are meant to ensure global data mobility. At the same time, international investment law will most likely be used to defend governments attempting to compel data sharing from private data holders. For these reasons, international economic law limits governments' ability to cope with asymmetric data ownership while promoting information holders' right to preserve control over data placement and utilization. Finally, recommendations are offered to foster a broader conversation, resulting in an overall performance of 96.7%.

AB  - Intelligent applications have become essential for effectively managing energy consumption in public buildings. Energy management, especially for critical infrastructure buildings and public buildings, often serves as an example of sustainable practices since it tries to increase energy resilience through backup power systems. These structures were dealing with more difficulties, such as tight budgets, complicated regulations, behavioral issues, and others. Managing energy consumption in buildings is a multifaceted undertaking that entails grappling with non-uniform energy usage and a lack of established design guidelines for implementing energy-efficient and sustainable solutions. Consequently, analyzing energy utilization trends in public buildings and projecting future energy requirements is of paramount importance. This comprehension is indispensable to the identification and acknowledgment of energy consumption patterns in commercial and institutional buildings. Our research is highly significant for optimizing energy usage, reducing environmental impact, and making informed decisions in building management. We emphasize the importance of our predictive capabilities, sustainability, and life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques in achieving these objectives. Our hybrid model improves energy efficiency while also making a significant contribution to the larger objective of meeting sustainability standards in the built environment through thorough analyses of real-world data. The goal of this study is to determine the most sensible classification and forecasting scheme for the energy usage rates of public structures. The goal of this study is to determine the most sensible classification and forecasting scheme for the energy usage rates of public structures. In order to determine the number of energy consumption pattern clusters, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) model was utilized in conjunction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The determination of clustering levels for each structure was executed by utilizing K-means in conjunction with a Genetic algorithm (GA). This approach enabled the identification of optimal clustering levels for the given structures, thereby facilitating effective analysis and interpretation of the data. The GA was specifically employed to determine the optimal centroid points for each cluster, thus optimizing the performance of the fitting model. Cluster analysis pattern extraction has made determining which buildings consume the most energy easier. As intelligent models for predicting energy usage, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and CNNs paired with a GA have also been used. The application of a GA to modify multiple settings of a CNN was conducted at this stage. The CNN model using a GA shows the method that was used provides higher accuracy and standard error compared to the conventional approach. It achieves a 94.01% accuracy on the training dataset and a 93.74% accuracy on the validation dataset with an error rate of 0.24 and 0.26 respectively. On the training dataset, the accuracy is 89.03% with a standard error of 0.3, whereas on the validation dataset, the accuracy is 88.91% with a 0.33 standard error. This research can help policymakers in the energy sector make better decisions regarding the timing of energy supply and demand for public buildings.

AB  - Traditional manufacturing systems face a major transition challenge toward intelligent and sustainable manufacturing systems. Energy-efficient manufacturing has become one of the main focuses of this transition because of the high and critical consumption of energy for the production of many industrial sectors. To this aim, modeling Energy Consumption (EC) behavior is a primary step to monitor and reduce consumption. However, it requires a deep understanding of the system’s kinematic and dynamic behaviors. Hence, creating a model from scratch can be challenging, which may result in a model that does not correctly represent the real system. With the advancement of digital technologies, it is now possible to collect and analyze data from manufacturing systems in real-time. This opens the door to the possibility of modeling the energy consumption behavior of different machine states based on a data-driven approach and keeping the current energy consumption under control and monitored using real-time data from the equipment. Prior research has been conducted in the literature incorporating EC modeling into a Digital Twin (DT). However, the addressed issue remains an open challenge due to its complexity. The proposed methodology solves the lack of literature by proposing a methodology that makes the EC modeling within the reach of any researcher or practitioner in the field. The current paper proposes a data-driven methodology for integrating the EC model into Digital Twins. The methodology is based on measurements to identify different segments and sub-states of EC of production equipment, using techniques such as segmentation and regression. It relies on power absorption measurement of industrial equipment to generate EC related-parameters to be fed into the DT model to monitor the current operating condition of the physical system. This work contributes to the DT-based sustainable transition by allowing to monitor and quantitatively measure those parameters which could be controlled to reduce EC. A case study on an industrial robot is used to validate and assess the performance of the approach in a laboratory environment.

AB  - Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading has gained much attention recently due to the advanced development of distributed energy resources. P2P enables prosumers to trade their surplus electricity and allows consumers to purchase affordable and locally produced renewable energy. Therefore, it is significant to develop solutions that are able to forecast energy consumption and generation toward better power management, thereby making renewable energy more accessible and empowering prosumers to make an informed decision on their energy management. In this paper, several models for forecasting short-term renewable energy consumption and generating are developed and discussed. Real-time energy datasets were collected from smart meters that were installed in residential premises in Western Australia. These datasets are collected from August 2018 to Apr 2019 at fine time resolution down to 5 s and comprise energy import from the grid, energy export to the grid, energy generation from installed rooftop PV, energy consumption in households, and outdoor temperature. Several models for forecasting short-term renewable energy consumption and generating are developed and discussed. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the optimised deep learning-based Long Term Short Memory (LSTM) model in forecasting both energy consumption and generation and outperforms the baseline model as well as the alternative classical and machine learning methods by a substantial margin.

AB  - ABSTRACT With the increased and rapid development of artificial intelligence-based algorithms coupled with the non-stop creation of material databases, artificial intelligence (AI) has played a great role in the development of high-performance electrochemical energy storage systems (EESSs). The development of high-performance EESSs requires the alignment of multiple properties or features of active materials of EESSs, which is currently achieved through experimental trial and error approaches that are tedious and laborious. In addition, they are considered costly, time-consuming and destructive. Hence, machine learning (ML), a crucial segment of AI, can readily accelerate the processing of feature- or property–performance characteristics of the existing and emerging chemistries and physics of active materials for the development of high-performance EESSs. Towards this direction, in this perspective, we present insight into how feature engineering can handle multiple feature/descriptor families of active materials of EESSs.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term for a wide range of machine intelligence systems that can replicate the behavior of humans. AI and Big Data have emerged as defining characteristics of the fourth industrial revolution (IR). AI has developed tools. Because of the novelty, the investigation of IR, AI, and their environmental effects is still in the early stages of exploration. This study investigates how IR and AI affect human and environmental health and also discusses IR, AI, machine-human ideas, innovation, and AI's environmental benefits, further examines the challenges of these innovations, and recommends additional studies to explain their progress. As a result, the application of AI technology in environmental management, particularly concerning pollution, has become a significant advancement in reshaping our approach to monitoring the environment. Numerous countries are reaping substantial advantages by integrating AI in creating, executing, and assessing measures to address environmental degradation. These innovations can yield societal advantages and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030; unfortunately, it is important to acknowledge that these benefits may not align well with environmental sustainability objectives, and the increasing number of electronic gadgets presents an additional concern. Conducting future research is crucial to investigate the growing prevalence of electronic devices utilized for AI, its potential ramifications for the future trajectory of climate change, and the approaches being taken to address the issue. Future research should prioritize conducting lifecycle environmental impact analyses, developing sustainable AI hardware, optimizing renewable energy usage, advancing climate modeling techniques, finding effective solutions for managing e-waste, utilizing AI for environmental monitoring and protection, conducting socio-environmental impact studies, developing policies and regulations, creating energy-efficient AI algorithms, and integrating circular economy principles to ensure that AI advancements align with environmental sustainability.

AB  - The adoption of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is expected to grow exponentially, especially as it offers efficient and cost-reducing options in an increasingly competitive business environment. The emergent business environment is facing increasing scrutiny and new regulations pertaining to sustainability. Hence, manufacturing in I4.0 is expected to contribute significantly to upping the sustainability quotient of businesses. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based regime, articulated by the United Nations, provides directions for assessing business performance on the sustainability yardstick. It is therefore imperative to understand and delineate the implications of I4.0 in the attainment of specific SDGs. The current research explores extant literature on this theme along with interaction with expert focus groups, composed of practitioners and researchers. An Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach has been used to identify eight key SDGs relevant and applicable to manufacturing. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), was applied thereafter, using the Super-Decisions software to understand the relationships between the I4.0 technologies (I4.0T) and the SDGs. The final synthesized outcome from AHP prioritized eight I4.0 building blocks. Digitalization of processes and systems; additive manufacturing; big data analytics; cloud computing and artificial intelligence; and machine language were identified as the top five drivers facilitating sustainable manufacturing. Together they account for 80 percent of the sustainability effort in manufacturing. The study proposes a metric called the Technology Driven Sustainability Index (TDSI) for measuring and tracking the progress of the impact of I4.0 on sustainability in the organization's I4.0 transformation journey.

AB  - Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly gaining interest in supply chain management due to the incorporation of digital technology in a range of operations. It facilitates the movement of commodities and data efficiently. However, despite the numerous benefits associated with BDA, there has been limited research on the extent to which BDA can improve environmental sustainability in supply chains. In an attempt to assess the depth of our knowledge, this study undertakes a bibliometric analysis in which 155 relevant articles are retrieved. The assessment discloses the various factors driving, limiting, and stimulating the adoption of BDA in the digital supply chain through analysis and discussion. Additionally, it suggests a framework linking the factors to achieve environmental sustainability. The outcomes of the evaluation indicate that the adoption of BDA could help in realizing an eco-friendly supply chain by reducing the carbon footprint, increasing product life cycles, minimizing the cost of transportation, and reducing transport-related emissions. This research suggests that policymakers should support BDA technology adoption for the reasons identified - it assists in boosting innovation and resilience in the increasingly competitive, ever changing market and the chaotic economic conditions of some industries. Many decisions made regarding environmental sustainability call for policies that will encourage BDA use to address climate, resources, energy management and sustainability factors.

AB  - Industrial development with the growth, strengthening, stability, technical advancement, reliability, selection, and dynamic response of the power system is essential. Governments and companies invest billions of dollars in technologies to convert, harvest, rising demand, changing demand and supply patterns, efficiency, lack of analytics required for optimal energy planning, and store energy. In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to play a major role in the energy market. Recognizing the importance of AI, this study was conducted on seven different energetics systems and their variety of applications, including: i) electricity production; ii) power delivery; iii) electric distribution networks; iv) energy storage; v) energy saving, new energy materials, and devices; vi) energy efficiency and nanotechnology; and vii) energy policy, and economics. The main drivers are the four key techniques used in current AI technologies, including: i) fuzzy logic systems; ii) artificial neural networks; iii) genetic algorithms; and iv) expert systems. In developed countries, the power industry has started using AI to connect with smart meters, smart grids, and the Internet of Things devices. These AI technologies will lead to the improvement of efficiency, energy management, transparency, and the usage of renewable energies. In recent decades/years, new AI technology has brought significant improvements to how power system devices monitor data, communicate with the system, analyze input–output, and display data in unprecedented ways. New applications in the energy system become feasible when these new AI developments are incorporated into the energy industry. But on the contrary, much more investment is needed in global research into AI and data-driven models. In terms of power supply, AI can help utilities provide customers with renewable and affordable electricity from complex sources in a secure manner, while at the same time providing these customers with the opportunity to use their own energy more efficiently. Moreover, policy recommendations, research opportunities, and how industry 4.0 will improve sustainability have been briefly described.

AB  - Since industrial development and globalization of the world, fossil fuels remain a major source of energy for almost all sectors of life. Fossil fuels, without doubt, play a vital role in the development of today’s world. However, there are increasing reservations about the consumption of fossil fuels due to their detrimental impact on our ecosystem. In recent decades, biodiesel has attracted much attention as a promising replacement for fossil fuel-based diesel, especially in the transportation sector. Biodiesel is a non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and carbon-free fuel that can be made from any kind of vegetable oil or fat. In recent developments, numerous techniques have been developed to efficiently prepare biodiesel from oil/fats. Therefore, in this paper, we cover a new advancement in techniques used for the conversion of oil/fat to biodiesel and the role of artificial intelligence (AI). AI approaches help predict the effectiveness of biodiesel production techniques and optimize the process, in addition to minimizing the cost of the process. The AI-enabled biodiesel prediction methods consist of several stages, i.e., biodiesel data collection, biodiesel data preprocessing, developing, and tuning machine learning (ML) algorithm on biodiesel data, and predicting unknown biodiesel properties. Therefore, the main purpose of applying AI to the biodiesel production process is to improve the process optimization and to develop AI models for fuel properties measurements and ultimately reduce the cost of the product. Because these problems have not been addressed previously, we hope that our analysis will help future researchers identify the appropriate technique and feedstock to produce high-quality biodiesel.

AB  - The challenges posed by both climate change and population expansion are unlike anything agriculture has ever seen, and in order to sustain and boost agricultural output, new and creative technology must be used. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one such exponent of change that offers possible solutions in a number of agricultural production fields. Emphasis will be placed on robotic automation, machine learning applications, and the concept of precision farming. This research explores how integration in agriculture has made AI an excellent support for decision processes in crop management, providing real-time monitoring and predictive analytics. Higher agricultural yields and resilience are made possible by genetic advancements and AI in resource optimization. However, due to technological, societal, and legal obstacles, the promise for AI in agriculture has not yet materialized. Against this background, this study requires holistic policy frameworks, education, and stakeholder engagement as countermeasures to such challenges. The future potential applications of AI in agriculture continue to change the sector on behalf of improving global food security and sustainability; this concludes the study. This paper tries to bring to light the critical role that AI is most likely to play in shaping future agricultural practices based on an in-depth analysis of the current state of technology and upcoming opportunities.

AB  - The last several years have seen unprecedented strain on food systems as a result of pandemics, climate change, population growth, and urbanization. Thus, academic and scientific communities now view global food security as a critical issue. However, food loss and waste are a major challenge when adopting food security and sustainability strategies, since a large proportion of food is lost or wasted along the food supply chain. In order to use resources efficiently and enhance food security and sustainability, food waste and by-products must be reduced and properly valorized. Plant-based food production generates various by-products which are generally rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds. Emerging technologies have been effectively employed to extract these valuable compounds with health benefits. Recently, Industry 4.0 technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, blockchain, robotics, smart sensors, 3D printing, and digital twins have a great deal of potential for waste reduction and by-products valorization in food industry. Reducing food waste not only benefits the environment, but also reduces greenhouse gas emissions and thus contributes to sustainable resource management. This review provides up-to-date information on the potential of Industry 4.0 for converting plant-based waste and by-products into valuable products. Recent studies showed that innovations in Industry 4.0 provide attractive opportunities to increase the effectiveness of manufacturing operations and improve food quality, safety and traceability. By leveraging Food Industry 4.0, companies can transform plant-based waste and by-products into valuable products and contribute to a more sustainable and efficient food production system.

AB  - Internet data centers have received significant scientific, public, and media attention due to the challenges associated with their greenhouse gas, water, and land footprint. This resource greedy data services sector continues to rapidly grow driven by data storage, data mining, and file sharing activities by a wide range of end-users. A fundamentally important question then arises; what impact does data storage have on the environment and is it sustainable? Water is used extensively in data centers, both directly for liquid cooling and indirectly to generate electricity. Data centers house a huge number of servers, which consume a vast amount of energy to respond to information requests and store files and large amounts of resulting data. Here we examine the environmental footprint of global data storage utilizing extensive datasets from the latest global electricity generation mix to throw light on this data sustainability issue. The analysis also provides a broad perspective of carbon, water, and land footprints due to worldwide data storage to through some light on the real impact of data centers globally. The findings indicate that if not properly handled, the annual global carbon, water and land footprints resulting from storing dark data might approach 5.26 million tons, 41.65 Gigaliters, and 59.45 square kilometers, respectively.

AB  - Integrating circular economy practices into supply chains is hailed as an effective pathway towards addressing pollution and resource depletion. However, implementing circular supply chains (CSCs) requires major shifts in current organizations' systems, processes, and competencies. Therefore, the successful implementation of CSCs depends largely on organizations' innovative and adaptive activities and capabilities; however, the role of such in the implementation of CSCs has largely been overlooked in the extant literature. To address this, this study investigates the impact of organizational ambidexterity activities (exploration and exploitation) on frugal innovation and, in turn, on the CSC. The study further examines the moderating role of artificial intelligence capabilities regarding the impact of frugal innovation on CSCs. We carried out a structured survey of textile manufacturing firms operating in Jordan, from which we gained 210 responses. The responses were analyzed using the SmartPLS software suite to assess the veracity of the measurement and test the hypothesized relationships. The analysis demonstrated that organizational ambidexterity activities (i.e., exploration and exploitation) positively influence frugal innovation. Additionally, the analysis uncovered that frugal innovation exerts a positive impact on the CSC, which is further enhanced when firm develop artificial intelligence capabilities. This provides valuable insights into the theoretical discourse and managerial practice on innovation and supply chain management.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) products play a significant role in achieving environmental sustainability. These products can save various resources (e.g., energy, water), achieve cost savings, and manage waste better. However, understanding the determinants affecting the use of AI products and their impact on environmental sustainability is relatively low, specifically in developing countries. To fill this gap in the literature, this study develops a theoretical model by integrating two well-known theories, UTAUT and PMT, to explain the determinants influencing Generation Z use of AI products and their impact on environmental sustainability. The developed model was then evaluated using the PLS-SEM approach based on data collected from 562 respondents in Malaysia and Turkey. Although effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, perceived severity, response efficacy, and response costs are significant drivers of green behavior among Malaysian individuals, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, perceived severity, response efficacy, and response costs are essential determinants among Turkish individuals. Interestingly, there is no significant difference between the importance of coping appraisals (i.e., self-efficacy, response efficacy, and response costs) among these two populations. The outcomes provide several contributions to the literature on AI and environmental sustainability and offer valuable insights for the practitioners, policymakers, and AI product developers.

AB  - This study aims to propose and investigate the key factors that predict the Utilization of Green Internet of Things (U-GIoT) applications by business organizations. This study will also look at the effect of using GIoT applications on energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction, which in turn, contributes to the sustainable green performance. Therefore, value-belief-norm theory (VBN) was chosen as the theoretical basis for this study's conceptual model. Two constructs derived from VBN (i.e. biospheric value and ecological worldview) are suggested as key predictors for the use of GIoT applications. The conceptual model is extended by considering the role of green marketing orientation (GMO); green energy awareness; and energy knowledge/technical capabilities. The current model also suggests that the utilization of GIoT applications would impact both energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. Online questionnaires are used to gather data from a purposive sample (n = 500) of managers and employees at different levels in different service organizations. Statistical results show strong evidence demonstrating the significant effect of biospheric value; ecological worldview; green marketing orientation (GMO); and energy knowledge/technical capabilities with GIoT. This study presents a valuable contribution that helps researchers; policy-makers, and practitioners to identify and understand the most important antecedents and consequences of U-GIoT. It is also worth noting for future studies looking at different applications of pro-environmental behaviour such as sustainable practices, green mobility and transportation, paperless work; recycling; reducing waste levels; and smart green solar. Policy-makers, decision-makers, practitioners and specialists in green energy systems (i.e. GIoT) will be able to use this information for future improvement.

AB  - Optimizing domestic energy use and increasing the efficiency of residential power supply chains depend much on home energy management (HEM) systems. This paper examines the utilization of advanced meta-heuristics, namely the Siberian Tiger Optimization (STO) and Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithms, for developing HEM systems. The paper presents an integrated STSC algorithm, enhanced by artificial intelligence, that monitors and optimizes household energy usage. To optimize electricity distribution, this algorithm seeks a compromise between reducing costs and lowering the peak-to-average proportion of power. After extensive simulations, the STSC algorithm outperforms previous meta-heuristics in Peak Average Ratio. It demonstrates the possibility of substantial cost reductions in residential settings, reaching up to 8.5%. This improves the overall efficiency of households’ power supply chains. In addition to reducing costs, the STSC algorithm contributes to sustainability objectives by utilizing AI to minimize carbon emissions, including renewable energy sources, and facilitate adaptable demand solutions. This highlights its role in promoting sustainable supply chain practices in energy efficiency. The combined use of STO and SCSO algorithms in the STSC method is a new and innovative development in HEM systems. This study highlights the capacity of AI-driven technologies to effectively and environmentally optimize household energy consumption.

AB  - Microgrid cost management is a significant difficulty because the energy generated by microgrids is typically derived from a variety of renewable and non-renewable sources. Furthermore, in order to meet the requirements of freed energy markets and secure load demand, a link between the microgrid and the national grid is always preferred. For all of these reasons, in order to minimize operating expenses, it is imperative to design a smart energy management unit to regulate various energy resources inside the microgrid. In this study, a smart unit idea for multi-source microgrid operation and cost management is presented. The proposed unit utilizes the Improved Artificial Rabbits Optimization Algorithm (IAROA) which is used to optimize the cost of operation based on current load demand, energy prices and generation capacities. Also, a comparison between the optimization outcomes obtained results is implemented using Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The results prove the applicability and feasibility of the proposed method for the demand management system in SMG. The price after applying HBA is 6244.5783 (ID). But after applying the Whale Optimization Algorithm, the cost is found 4283.9755 (ID), and after applying the Artificial Rabbits Optimization Algorithm, the cost is found 1227.4482 (ID). By comparing the proposed method with conventional method, the whale optimization algorithm saved 31.396 % per day, and the proposed artificial rabbit's optimization algorithm saved 80.3437 % per day. From the obtained results the proposed algorithm gives superior performance.

AB  - The metaverse is a nascent concept that envisions a virtual universe, a collaborative space where individuals can interact, create, and participate in a wide range of activities. Privacy in the metaverse is a critical concern as the concept evolves and immersive virtual experiences become more prevalent. The metaverse privacy problem refers to the challenges and concerns surrounding the privacy of personal information and data within Virtual Reality (VR) environments as the concept of a shared VR space becomes more accessible. Metaverse will harness advancements from various technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Extended Reality (XR) and Mixed Reality (MR) to provide personalized and immersive services to its users. Moreover, to enable more personalized experiences, the metaverse relies on the collection of fine-grained user data that leads to various privacy issues. Therefore, before the potential of the metaverse can be fully realized, privacy concerns related to personal information and data within VR environments must be addressed. This includes safeguarding users’ control over their data, ensuring the security of their personal information, and protecting in-world actions and interactions from unauthorized sharing. In this paper, we explore various privacy challenges that future metaverses are expected to face, given their reliance on AI for tracking users, creating XR and MR experiences, and facilitating interactions. Moreover, we thoroughly analyze technical solutions such as differential privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, and Federated Learning and discuss related sociotechnical issues regarding privacy.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are two of the fastest-growing technologies in the world. With more people moving to cities, the concept of a smart city is not foreign. The idea of a smart city is based on transforming the healthcare sector by increasing its efficiency, lowering costs, and putting the focus back on a better patient care system. Implementing IoT and AI for remote healthcare monitoring (RHM) systems requires a deep understanding of different frameworks in smart cities. These frameworks occur in the form of underlying technologies, devices, systems, models, designs, use cases, and applications. The IoT-based RHM system mainly employs both AI and machine learning (ML) by gathering different records and datasets. On the other hand, ML methods are broadly used to create analytic representations and are incorporated into clinical decision support systems and diverse healthcare service forms. After carefully examining each factor in clinical decision support systems, a unique treatment, lifestyle advice, and care strategy are proposed to patients. The technology used helps to support healthcare applications and analyze activities, body temperature, heart rate, blood glucose, etcetera. Keeping this in mind, this paper provides a survey that focuses on the identification of the most relevant health Internet of things (H-IoT) applications supported by smart city infrastructure. This study also evaluates related technologies and systems for RHM services by understanding the most pertinent monitoring applications based on several models with different corresponding IoT-based sensors. Finally, this research contributes to scientific knowledge by highlighting the main limitations of the topic and recommending possible opportunities in this research area.

Consequently, various initiatives have emerged to promote what is termed "green artificial intelligence," aiming to mitigate these environmental impacts. Nevertheless, research discussing these initiatives remains scarce. Hence, this study aims to identify green artificial intelligence initiatives that contribute to environmental friendliness. This paper has comprehensively reviewed the existing literature, professional websites, and expert blogs to identify and analyze available green AI initiatives. This paper has identified 55 such initiatives, broadly categorized into six themes: cloud optimization, model efficiency, carbon footprinting, sustainability-focused AI development, open-source initiatives, and green AI research and community. This study discusses the strengths and limitations of each initiative to offer a comprehensive overview. The findings provide valuable insights, particularly for industries interested in green artificial intelligence and green technology in general. While some tools have been recognized and studied, comprehensive research and analysis are still required to empirically evaluate the majority of other tools due to their early stages of development in this field.

AB  - Novel biomass bioenergy-bioexergy analyses via thermogravimetry analysis and artificial intelligence are employed to evaluate the three biofuels from wood wastes (softwood-SW, hardwood-HW, and woods blend-WB). The chemical characterization of SW has the highest bioenergy (higher heating value – HHV: 18.84 MJ kg−1) and bioexergy (specific chemical bioexergy – SCB: 19.65 MJ kg−1) with the SCB/HHV ratio of wood waste as about 1.043–1.046. The high C-element has a significant influence on the HHV-SCB. The three distinct zones of wood waste combustion are identified: moisture evaporation (Zone I, up to 110 °C), combustion reaction – degradation of three major lignocellulosic components (hemicelluloses, cellulose, and lignin) at Zone II, 110–600 °C, and ash remains (Zone III, 600–800 °C). The ignition (Dig = 0.01–0.04) and fuel reactivity (Rfuel = 3.82–6.97 %·min−1·°C−1) indexes are evaluated. The comprehensive combustion index (Sn:>5 × 10−7%2 min−2 °C−3) suggests that wood waste has a better combustion performance than bituminous coal. The statistical evaluation presents that the highest HHV-SCB values are obtained by performing combustion for SW-250 μm at 15 °C·min−1. The S/N ratio and ANOVA results agree that the wood waste type and particle size denote the most influential parameters. The artificial neural network prediction shows an excellent result (R2 = 1) with 1 hidden layer and 5 neuron configurations.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of effective vaccines, yet their development is a challenging and demanding process. It requires identifying antigens that elicit protective immunity, selecting adjuvants that enhance immunogenicity, and designing delivery systems that ensure optimal efficacy. Artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate this process by using machine learning methods to analyze large and diverse datasets, suggest novel vaccine candidates, and refine their design and predict their performance. This review explores how AI can be applied to various aspects of vaccine development, such as predicting immune response from protein sequences, discovering adjuvants, optimizing vaccine doses, modeling vaccine supply chains, and predicting protein structures. We also address the challenges and ethical issues that emerge from the use of AI in vaccine development, such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and health data sensitivity. We contend that AI has immense potential to accelerate vaccine development and respond to future pandemics, but it also requires careful attention to the quality and validity of the data and methods used.

AB  - In the fight against climate change, and to improve its sustainability standards, the building sector is trying to reduce its energy consumption and environmental footprint. Leveraging digitalization, in the wake of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, holds immense potential in revolutionizing the buildings and construction sector. Digitalization is transforming buildings throughout their life cycle encompassing design, construction, operation, and retrofitting/decommissioning stages. This study aims to analyze the role of digital technologies in sustainable buildings. In doing so, a systematic literature review is conducted to examine the current landscape of the application of 13 key digital technologies - sensors, Building information modeling (BIM), Building Management Systems (BMS), smart meters, 3D printing/additive manufacturing, robotics, big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, artificial intelligence, digital twin, blockchain, and cyber security - in terms of their scope and prospects in the building sector. These technologies have been discussed considering their functions, applications in buildings, adoption and market trends, challenges, and the way forward. The findings of the study reveal that digital technologies are making buildings more integrated, flexible, energy-efficient, smart, and sustainable by optimizing resource utilization, enhancing operational efficiency, and minimizing environmental impact. For instance, sensors enable real-time data collection, BIM facilitates sustainability assessments, and AI enhances energy management. Further, digital technologies can lead to a 30%–50% improvement in energy intensity in the building sector by 2040. While digital technologies offer promising solutions in terms of improving sustainability standards in buildings, they also face several challenges such as high initial cost, privacy and security risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks, and lack of customer awareness and a skilled workforce. Conducive policies and regulations are critical for creating an enabling environment that supports the adoption of digital technologies.

AB  - The global consumer market demands personalized products and it is quite challenging for the manufacturing industry to address the consumer requirements along with optimal production. In order to curb customization and production challenges, emerging industrial technologies (EIT) are adopted by the industries such as artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), autonomous robots (AuR), and mobile technologies (MT). However, this technological transformation may impact organizational sustainability due to EIT's higher capital investment, lack of skilled personnel to operate EIT, and EIT dependency on extensive energy consumption. In addition, EIT must resonate with the sustainable ways of production and consumption which again brings in another challenge of balancing sustainability and production. Ambidextrous practices may enable industrial stakeholders to explore and exploit this disparity. Therefore, it is required to explore the impact of EIT on organizational sustainability along with the mediation of ambidextrous practices which is a notable gap in the existing literature. The sample is taken from Pakistani textile industry to estimate the relationship between the research variables while a quantitative survey approach was adopted to collect data from textile industry professionals. The collected data from 192 respondents was analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method in SmartPLS 4.

AB  - Concerned by the continuous decline in the quality of life, poverty, environmental degradation, and escalated war and conflicts, the United Nations in 2015 instituted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets. Access to clean, modern, and affordable energy, also known as SDG 7, is one of the goals. Universal access to clean, modern, and affordable electricity is one of the metrics for measuring a good life as it fundamentally affects education, healthcare, food security, job creation, and other socioeconomic indices. To achieve this goal and targets, there has been increased traction in research, development, actionable plans, policies, and other activities by governments, the scientific community, environmentalists, development experts, and other stakeholders in achieving the goal. This review presents the various avenues by which AI and digitization can provide impetus to achieving SDG 7. The global trends in attaining clean electricity, clean cooking fuel, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and international public financial flows between 2005 and 2021 are reviewed while the contribution of AI and digitization towards meeting SDG 7 are highlighted. The study concludes that the deployment of AI and digitization into the energy sector will catalyze the attainment of SDG 7 by 2030, provided ethical issues, regulatory concerns, manpower shortage, and other shortcomings are effectively handled. The study recommends adequate infrastructural upgrades, modernization of data collection, storage, and analysis capabilities, improved awareness and education, professional development, collaborative innovation, and promotion of legal and ethical issues as ways of advancing universal access to energy by 2030. Going forward, more collaborations between academic and research institutions and energy producers will help produce experts and professionals to propel innovative deployment of digital technologies in the energy sector.

AB  - A hydrogen economy services a substantial portion of its energy requirements from hydrogen, as an energy carrier. This is essentially a circular low-carbon economy that is characterized by low levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The vision to attain a low-carbon economy would become a reality if only hydrogen fuel itself can be produced in an economical and eco-friendly manner. Current hydrogen energy production processes are characterized by high costs and high carbon emissions and other challenges that arises as a result of these. To address these challenges, various routes to hydrogen energy production are currently being explored by the research community. The immense benefits to be derived from application of machine learning (ML) and associated artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in the design and delivery of low-carbon hydrogen production processes are obvious, given the success of AI/ML in the domain of materials discovery for energy systems in general. This chapter discusses therefore, the current and emerging challenges for low-carbon hydrogen production with practical insights into how current mainstream low-carbon hydrogen production methods and high-throughput but high carbon footprint techniques can be improved by leveraging current advances in AI/ML for accelerated attainment of hydrogen economy.

A partner in this supply chain can be a sub-contractor to whom work is outsourced. Each partner in a supply chain uses data, generates data and shares data with other partners, and all this collaboration contributes to producing and delivering the product(s) or service(s). The main security challenge in supply chains is the unauthorized disclosure and data leakage of information shared among the partners. Current approaches for protecting data in supply chain rely on the use of standards, service level agreements, and legal contracts. We propose an auditing based approach for protecting shared data in digital supply chains.

AB  - Electronic garbage, or “e-waste,” is becoming a major environmental issue, especially in the wealthiest countries. Although there are technical alternatives for processing e-waste, the high cost of execution makes them difficult to apply. As a result, a lot of wealthy countries choose to export a large amount of their e-waste to less developed countries, which is a financially cheaper option. Complete implementation is still elusive despite the existence of several laws and policies at all levels of government, such as the regional Bamoko Convention, the international Basel Convention, and numerous national rules. Financial strains to maintain employment in the processing of e-waste make matters more difficult. Numerous management strategies are available to lessen the negative effects, including implementing the circular economy idea, encouraging urban mining, plugging gaps in the system, improving current laws and rules, and tackling economic inequality in the hierarchy of e-waste disposal management. The main point of the message is that rich countries should help developing countries deal with the e-waste issue rather than shifting their environmental issues on these underdeveloped areas.

AB  - The rising volume of waste generated by electrical and electronic equipment is a significant global environmental concern. The effective management of electronic waste (e-waste) is now a crucial issue for socio-economic and environmental sustainability. This study aims to develop a predictive model using the Fourier series method to estimate the daily per capita production of electronic and solid waste. The study area was divided into three categories: administrative and office buildings, classroom buildings, and student lounges. Each category included four specific floors where bins were placed for data collection. The bins were emptied in the mornings on thirty consecutive weekdays over four weeks, and the waste was quantified using suitable equipment for analysis. The bins were serviced in the mornings on thirty consecutive weekdays over four weeks, and the waste amounts were measured using appropriate equipment to provide data for analysis. The results indicate a positive trend in the e-waste data for office, laboratory, lecture, and lounge rooms concerning the time and e-waste office data. However, the stationary assumption is not met, and a negative trend is observed. It is anticipated that e-waste from the lounge room will increase over the next 5 days, as evidenced by the rising blue curve. Model 1, applied to forecast e-waste for office rooms, predicts a decreasing trend in e-waste following the initial 30-day data. Model 2, using only one lag variable, suggests a constant trend for e-waste from the lecture room, with consistent forecasts for the next 5 days. Model 3, also utilizing a single lag variable, shows nearly constant observed data for e-waste in the laboratory room, indicating that the expected quantity of e-waste from the laboratory will remain unchanged. Finally, Model 4, with only one lag variable, predicts an increase in e-waste from the lounge room over the following 5 days, as indicated by the rising blue curve. Initiating waste reduction is often considered a rational initial step in establishing sustainable solid waste management practices. Reducing the quantity of waste that needs to be collected and disposed of is essential. Sanitation officers are advised to adopt the following strategies to decrease the per capita production of solid waste and enhance its disposal methods.

AB  - As the usage of information and communication technology (ICT) solution have been exploded in the last decades, the research community exhibits a deficiency in terms of methodologies for accurately quantifying the energy consumption of individual ICT components. This paper presents a novel methodology aimed at addressing the existing research gap by offering a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption ranges for ICT components, measured in Watt. The methodology being proposed involves the classification of ICT components into distinct classes, namely sensors, gateways, servers-platforms, and databases, while these classes are further subdivided into sub-classes. The calculation of energy consumption places emphasis on particular components within each sub-class, encompassing CPUs, RAM, GPUs, hard drives, network switches, cooling systems, and communication units. Compared with existing green ICT standards where mainly focused on strategy-related recommendations, the methodology utilises manufacturers’ specifications for standard operational procedures in order to compute energy consumption. The objective of the methodology is to extend the current research and provide countable energy consumption attributes of various component types, that are used in the ICT architecture, supporting the decision-making process of architects regarding environmentally sustainable and high-performance device selection. This study concludes with the development of a tree diagram for calculating the energy consumption of an ICT system.

AB  - This paper describes applications of artificial intelligence to estimate indoor carbon dioxide levels, even in the absence of a direct CO2 sensor, based on simply obtained indoor parameters. The aim is to develop a novel universal model that is easy to use in a wide range of applications and easy to replicate. The presented predictive models are based on experimental data collected via affordable microclimate stations. They are built with Wi-Fi-enabled microcontrollers similar to Arduino, designed to monitor environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, human presence, atmospheric pressure, and carbon dioxide levels. The experimental dataused to train and test the models are specifically collected for this analysis in a primary school classroom in Bialystok, Poland, through the homemade stations that gather data minute-by-minute. Linear and non-linear modelsinclude machine learning models such as SVM, random forest, decision tree, and neural networks. Among the various models tested, the random forest method, which relied solely on temperature, humidity, and human presence measurements, produced the most accurate results, achieving an R-squared value of 0.89. The use of temperature, humidity, and presence sensors, which are more affordable than CO2 sensors, highlights the novelty of the present analysis and the cost-effectiveness of predictive modelling in environmental monitoring.

AB  - Since the Industrial Revolution, the globe has witnessed several challenges, and environmental degradation (ED) has become prominent. Thus, to deal with such environmental issues, the world has introduced several initiatives, including the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In such environmental conditions, energy resilience (ER) is performing well in boosting the energy supply, energy transition, and sustainable growth. Conversely, it also needs help with the optimum utilization of green energy in human and economic activities. Therefore, this study focuses on the green role of supply chain digitization via Artificial Intelligence (AI) in energy transition that may bring a new perspective to energy-environment research. As a result, the present study covers income, urbanization, artificial Intelligence, energy transition, financial development, and green innovations as environmental factors in 32 OECD economies covering the period of 2005–2022. The Quantile Generalized Method of Moment (Q-GMM) estimator is utilized to investigate the study’s objectives. Investigated results describe the significant contribution of income, urbanization, green technology, and financial development to ED. In contrast, energy transition and AI support the sustainability theme. Besides, most nations have faced numerous problems regarding ER and have tried to solve this issue by helping other sectors. This study introduces the mediating role of energy transition via green technology, AI, and heterogeneous financial sector measures and obtains exciting connections. Under this theme, green technology, AI, and financial loans to the private sector describe a significant decline in emissions via energy transition. Conversely, the mediating role of bank loans and financial depth on energy transition shows a negative but insignificant impact on sustainability. Moreover, the mediating role for financial efficiency and stability describes the positive but insignificant effect on emissions levels. However, under the comparative analysis, the financial sector shows a positive and significant connection with emissions by loans to the private sector and financial depth. Few policy implications are suggested for environmental and ER challenges.

AB  - The digital technologies are transforming the financial markets and may prove to be a game-changer in terms of attaining SDG objectives over time. As a result, UN agencies have begun to prioritize the utilization of the digital revolution to advance SDGs. There is a growing body of literature on the use of digital money to achieve sustainability objectives. As businesses commit to protecting the environment, natural systems, and society, consumer eco-awareness has elevated the importance of the issue in the field of sustainable digital finance. The rationale behind this study is to unify the fragmented literature on digital money and to present a clear conceptual framework for sustainable digital finance in order to advance sustainability goals. Specifically, the study aims to investigate the evolution of sustainable digital finance through analyzing publication and citation trends, developing an author-country-keyword framework, and exploring the significant themes and subjects emerging from the field of sustainable digital finance. Additionally, the study examines ongoing shifts in the digital finance sector and the digital sustainable revolution, which can help us harness technology for social good (Grand Challenge: social work) and move closer to achieving sustainable development goals. We employ a two-tiered analytic strategy, comprising of bibliometric analysis and an integrated literature evaluation of 168 publications from the Web of Science database. In addition to descriptive and thematic analysis, the findings provide us with seven relevant themes (financial involvement and participation, sustainable financial development, green finance, digital venture capital, fintech, financial performance, and digital strategy) and four prominent aggregate dimensions (digital financial inclusion, digital sustainable revolution, digital financial transformation, and harness technology for social good), which will be included in the conceptual framework for future research endeavors. The paper concludes with the policy implications of the findings.

AB  - Prior research has primarily concentrated on non-digital and process-oriented methods for achieving carbon neutrality (CN) in the context of mitigating climate change (CC), while the potential of digital technology (DT) has hardly been investigated. This study addresses this gap by answering four research questions: How are firms utilizing DT to achieve CN? What drives the adoption of DT for achieving CN? What are the barriers that prevent the adoption of DT for achieving CN? What risk mitigation strategies can be adopted by firms to overcome these barriers? An inductive method using open-ended essays has been adopted to gather data from firms that have already implemented DT for CN. The findings revealed four distinct dimensions. Utilization of DT for CN includes enhancing business value, managing one's carbon footprint, enabling smart solutions, and enhancing efficiency. The drivers for adopting DT for CN included driving business growth, external pressures, competitive advantage, and environmental consciousness. Key barriers included financial barriers, technological barriers, human resource barriers, and external barriers. Risk mitigation strategies included pre-implementation strategies, detailed planning and evaluation, ensuring employees' buy-in and readiness, and external stakeholder engagement. This study offers a broad-based foundation for designing DT strategies for achieving CN.

AB  - Efficacy of the traditional individualistic viewpoint towards mental health is questionable, particularly in the context of the Global South countries. Past works in psychology have rarely incorporated people’s background and surroundings in dealing with mental health. In contrast, we argue that many mental health problems of people living in the Global South countries are rooted in underdevelopment. Analyzing 1,000 call data of a telephone crisis helpline in Bangladesh, we found that 91% of the cases where callers shared their problems were impacted by failure to meet one of the 17 sustainable developed goals proposed by United Nations. Challenges towards ensuring gender equality, good health and well-being, quality education, and decent work and economic growth among a few others were causing mental health problems among callers. Our findings demonstrate the need to revise support behavior models followed by helplines in the Global South and advocate for a shift in viewing mental health problems from an individualistic to a social approach.

AB  - The recent advancements made in the realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) have unveiled transformative prospects and opportunities to enhance and optimize the environmental performance and efficiency of smart cities. These strides have, in turn, impacted smart eco-cities, catalyzing ongoing improvements and driving solutions to address complex environmental challenges. This aligns with the visionary concept of smarter eco-cities, an emerging paradigm of urbanism characterized by the seamless integration of advanced technologies and environmental strategies. However, there remains a significant gap in thoroughly understanding this new paradigm and the intricate spectrum of its multifaceted underlying dimensions. To bridge this gap, this study provides a comprehensive systematic review of the burgeoning landscape of smarter eco-cities and their leading-edge AI and AIoT solutions for environmental sustainability. To ensure thoroughness, the study employs a unified evidence synthesis framework integrating aggregative, configurative, and narrative synthesis approaches. At the core of this study lie these subsequent research inquiries: What are the foundational underpinnings of emerging smarter eco-cities, and how do they intricately interrelate, particularly urbanism paradigms, environmental solutions, and data-driven technologies? What are the key drivers and enablers propelling the materialization of smarter eco-cities? What are the primary AI and AIoT solutions that can be harnessed in the development of smarter eco-cities? In what ways do AI and AIoT technologies contribute to fostering environmental sustainability practices, and what potential benefits and opportunities do they offer for smarter eco-cities? What challenges and barriers arise in the implementation of AI and AIoT solutions for the development of smarter eco-cities? The findings significantly deepen and broaden our understanding of both the significant potential of AI and AIoT technologies to enhance sustainable urban development practices, as well as the formidable nature of the challenges they pose. Beyond theoretical enrichment, these findings offer invaluable insights and new perspectives poised to empower policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to advance the integration of eco-urbanism and AI- and AIoT-driven urbanism. Through an insightful exploration of the contemporary urban landscape and the identification of successfully applied AI and AIoT solutions, stakeholders gain the necessary groundwork for making well-informed decisions, implementing effective strategies, and designing policies that prioritize environmental well-being.

AB  - Advancements in smart devices, wearable gadgets, sensors, and communication paradigm have enabled the vision of smart cities, pervasive healthcare, augmented reality and interactive multimedia, Internet of Every Thing (IoE), and cognitive assistance, to name a few. All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing. State of the art literature on edge computing domain is included in the survey to guide readers towards the current trends and future opportunities in the area of edge computing.

AB  - Sustainable economic development is the need of the current era which is not possible without the environment friendly energy consumption. Digitalization which is the major part of economic life also has a major role in determining the level of clean energy in an economy. Therefore, this study investigates the nonlinear relationship between digitalization and renewable energy consumption with particular focus on the role of human capital as a moderating factor. This study has developed a panel of the countries that are part of the One Belt One Road project from 1996 to 2019. The results of augmented system GMM show that, initially, digitalization adversely effects the renewable energy consumption, however; after specific threshold value, the impact of digitalization convert from adverse to beneficial for the renewable energy development. This study also shows that human that capital moderates the relationship between digitalization and renewable energy in a positive way showing a good human capital helps countries to early ending the negative impact of digitalization on renewable energy. The study also offers the policy implications that BRI countries should set energy efficiency standards for digital infrastructures, offer incentives for green data centers and simultaneously invest in human capital development.

AB  - The increase in demand due to scientific innovation and economic expansion raises challenges linked to environmental impact and sustainable market development. This study analyzes the role played by Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading in system operation. Several case studies with four distinct prosumer models, each fitted with diverse Energy Storage Systems (ESS), photovoltaic (PV) systems, and responsive demand technologies such as Electric Vehicles (EV), are examined. An economic analysis is conducted using the developed interface. An energy management system establishes a dynamic market framework, enabling energy trading via P2P market operators and distribution system operators. The implemented trading platform is chosen depending on pricing variations across different time intervals for home models. The P2P energy trading system employs mathematical modeling via deep learning to achieve an optimal solution that minimizes costs. The study uses other domestic models and optimization techniques to explore the amount of energy traded across households and timeframes. Additionally, it investigates the accomplishment of two-way energy transfer in electric cars, the importance of energy storage and photovoltaic systems, and various housing scenarios concerning peer-to-peer energy trading. Additionally, the system's advantages are demonstrated to participants beforehand by validating and presenting data through an input and output system that accepts these instances.

AB  - We introduce a new conceptual approach to green data centers through the use of multiple, distributed networked data centers that are co-located with renewable energy. While green data centers are a well-established objective, conventional approaches have focused on either high efficiencies and/or the use of renewable energy. This model extends and innovates both approaches with three key design aspects. First, it emphasizes the use of many small, geographically distributed mini data centers. Second, such data centers can operate with the option of being dislocated from the electrical grid via a mini-grid, or behind the meter. Third, the approach enhances the use of renewable energy via the ability to transfer computing load from one mini data center to another as renewable supply or market contexts dictate. This paper introduces the conceptual approach, outlines the research broadly, and examines potential technical, economic, and policy constraints for the establishment of this approach on a broad scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of this model for the developing world, particularly in areas without substantial electricity transmission infrastructure.

AB  - This paper presents the assessment and management of emissions of pollutant gases at telecommunication base stations (BSs) due to the operations of diesel generators. A model combining the source testing method with an artificial neural network (ANN) technique and the Internet of Things (IoT) system is proposed in this paper. The actual concentration of gases and particles like carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter in the atmosphere due to the operation of base stations in Abuja, Nigeria is studied. The results show that measured emission of CO2 gas was the highest; ranging from 1976 to 4498 ppm at the BS sites and exceeding the normal outdoor level and maximum permissible safety level. Generally, all gases and particles measured at the generator sites exceeded the acceptable limit, thereby exposing workers at these BSs to health hazards. Measured emissions for NO2 at locations away from the BS sites surpassed the set limits, which highlights the need for cleaner sources of energy to power the BSs especially given the toxicity of this gas. Furthermore, about 48% of the measured data for SO2 gas exceeded the recommended limit. The values measured for PM2.5 and PM10 also exceed the recommended 150 µg/m3 limit, thereby posing health risks to the site workers and residents in the neighbourhood. The ANN technique is employed to analyse the data and ensure that future emissions from base stations can be predicted with a degree of accuracy, and to assess the factors that affect these emissions. The result shows that the proposed ANN model efficiently predicted the emissions of the pollutant gases with an overall correlation coefficient value of 0.93719, thus making it a good fit in forecasting. An IoT-based system is also proposed as a solution to reduce these greenhouse gases.

AB  - As part of global climate action, digital technologies are seen as a key enabler of energy efficiency savings. A popular application domain for this work is smart homes. There is a risk, however, that these efficiency gains result in rebound effects, which reduce or even overcompensate the savings. Rebound effects are well-established in economics, but it is less clear whether they also inform smart energy research in other disciplines. In this paper, we ask: to what extent have rebound effects and their underlying mechanisms been considered in computing, HCI and smart home research? To answer this, we conducted a literature mapping drawing on four scientific databases and a SIGCHI corpus. Our results reveal limited consideration of rebound effects and significant opportunities for HCI to advance this topic. We conclude with a taxonomy of actions for HCI to address rebound effects and help determine the viability of energy efficiency projects.

With the growing interest of customers, employees, and investors in societal challenges, as well as the availability and affordability of digital technologies, DSI gains importance for organisations to achieve long-term success. Although DSI has evoked increasing interest, research and practice are far from realising the potential of DSI as guidance on its successful development is missing. To minimise the risk of failure and fully exploit the benefits of DSI, this research explores DSI success factors based on a systematic literature review and explorative interview. Building on these valuable insights, we present the DSI success factor framework (DSF) consisting of 18 DSI success factors in three categories, moderating factors, and the DSI success. The DSF contributes descriptive knowledge on DSI development and is a foundation for further research while inspiring practitioners to successfully develop DSI.

In parallel, existing industry regulations, such as GDPR, MIFID II or SM&CR, are being “retrofitted” and reinterpreted from the perspective of AI. In this paper we identify and analyze ten novel, “second generation” themes which are likely to become regulatory considerations in the near future: non-personal data, managerial accountability, robo-advisory, generative AI, privacy enhancing techniques (PETs), profiling, emergent behaviours, smart contracts, ESG and algorithm management. The themes have been identified on the basis of ongoing developments in AI, existing regulations and industry discussions. Prior to making any new regulatory recommendations we explore whether novel issues can be solved by existing regulations. The contribution of this paper is a comprehensive picture of emerging regulatory considerations for AI in investment management, as well as broader financial services, and the ways they might be addressed by regulations – future or existing ones.

The next evolution after wearable devices are Point-Of-Care (POC) devices, which provide more vital parameter analyses for everyone. The electrification of POC devices is required to simplify the process and to increase the accuracy of measurement results. In this work, we focus on POC devices in combination with smartphones. Of Ten, these devices are measuring and processing very sensitive data, which underlie a high privacy restriction. Therefore, it is required to provide an architecture and security issue analysis of POC devices. The outcome of this research contribution provides a sensitization for the requirement of enhanced security features. Especially, to fulfill the need for a power-aware security concept for a POC system architecture, which underlies limited resources like power consumption.

AB  - Circular electronics is an emerging solution to the environmental issue linked to e-devices. This concept maximizes the life cycle of a product by reusing, refurbishing or recycling it as much as possible, with disposal to landfills as the last resort which eventually help reduce e-waste generation and carbon emissions over time. In this study, we developed a Multi-Agent based Model and used this to analyze the emerging trends in circular electronics. We utilized the data available for iPhone 11 and results showed that circular processes–reduced by design, reuse, refurbishment, and recycling–significantly lower carbon emissions and e-waste generation. These findings showcase the many benefits circular electronics holds and its potential as an economic strategy in the near future–specially to developing countries. Other advantages of circular electronics and some challenges with this concept are also discussed.

AB  - Mitigating climate change and its impacts is one of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) required by United Nations for an urgent action. Increasing carbon emissions due to human activities is the root cause to climate change. Telecommunication networks that provide service connectivity to mobile users contribute great amount of carbon emissions by consuming lots of non-renewable energy sources. Beyond the improvement on energy efficiency, to reduce the carbon footprint, telecom operators are increasing their adoption of renewable energy (e.g., wind power). The high variability of renewable energy in time and location; however, creates difficulties for operators when utilizing renewables for the reduction of carbon emissions. In this paper, we consider a heterogeneous network consisted of one macro base station (MBS) and multiple small base stations (SBSs) where each base station (BS) is powered by both of renewable and non-renewable energy. Different from the prior works that target on the total power consumption, we propose a novel scheme to minimize the carbon footprint of networks by dynamically switching the ON/OFF modes of SBSs and adjusting the association between users and BSs to access renewables as much as possible. Our numerical analysis shows that the proposed scheme significantly reduces up to 86% of the non-renewable energy consumption compared to two representative baselines.

AB  - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have brought new opportunities for interaction between municipalities and their citizens. In this sense, it is appropriate to understand how digital platforms, such as the ODSlocal, are being used for reporting on projects and good practices that contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the municipal level in Portugal. Through the application of non-parametric tests, it was possible to determine that the reporting of these practices is not uniform between municipalities, since it varies according to their location, dimension and adherence to sustainable networks or programs. Thus, a more robust focus on ICT and promotion of local community participation is suggested for the SDGs achievement.

AB  - In the face of multiple global crises such as climate change, a transformation towards sustainable development is more urgent than ever. Digitalization, as a fundamental change in society and the economy, offers great opportunities for sustainable development, but also poses its own threats, as evident in the immense resource consumption and growing surveillance tendencies. To leverage digitalization for sustainability transformation without compromising it, software engineering requires a significant shift in practices and structures. However, research in this area is still immature, lacking a deeper understanding of sustainability, its application in practice and solid engineering approaches. To bridge these gaps, this thesis aims to operationalize sustainability by proposing sustainability goals for software engineering, followed by the development of novel assessment methods and appropriate tool support.

AB  - Mobile communication — fueled by continuous technology innovation over several decades — is anchoring ever deeper into the heart of our society. It can contribute to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by offering pervasive connectivity to improve human society efficiency in an increasingly sustainable manner. Because carbon emissions is a major cause of global warming and climate change, it is crucial that, with the future expected data growth in mobile communications, services can also be provided in a sustainable manner, forging a path toward carbon neutrality. Therefore, the development of new technologies natively designed for carbon footprint reduction is a key objective. This article focuses on two directions for a sustainable 6G system design: energy efficiency and carbon-awareness. Energy efficiency ultimately aims at minimizing the overall electricity needs of the 6G system, and thus, also the related carbon emissions from power plants. Additionally, carbon-awareness could enable reducing and limiting the carbon footprint of the 6G system.

AB  - Due to the electrification and digitization of things such as public services, communication systems, and transport systems, data centers have become part of the critical infrastructure of today's society. The data centers as a resource-intensive industry, perturbates the energy and spatial systems where established. Currently, municipalities as the main entities responsible for local resource management, often lack the power and/or determination to plan spatial and energy aspects cohesively. Consequently, municipalities encounter resource management issues when planning for data center locations; high resource demand (water, electricity, land) and high resource waste (excess heat). This research aims to support urban planners, municipal energy companies, politicians, and other relevant decision-makers, in developing municipal energy and spatial systems that account for data centers' resource demand as well as using their resources produced in the form of excess heat for the community's benefit. This study compares energy and spatial aspects in relevant data center locations in Stockholm and Luleå municipalities from an urban planning perspective. The results suggest that municipalities' energy and spatial systems can increase their adaptive capacity towards data center establishment by considering certain resource planning determinants: electricity and water infrastructure availability, heat producers and users' diversity, land use diversity, and property fragmentation.

AB  - This study uses the dynamic capabilities view (DCV) as the theoretical framework to explore how servitization, service innovation, and technology platforms can reduce carbon emissions in Africa’s agri-food industry. The agri-food sector, which plays a significant role in global carbon emissions, is under pressure to make sustainable changes. This study investigates servitization, which integrates services with traditional products to enhance environmental sustainability. The study shows how dynamic capabilities help adjust to environmental and technological changes for sustainability. Employing a natural experiment methodology, we analyzed data on African agri-food firms from 2020 to 2022, comparing those that have implemented servitization strategies against those that have not. The findings reveal that servitization, mainly supported by service innovation and technology platforms, significantly contributes to lowering carbon emissions, leading toward sustainable agricultural practices. The findings broaden the DCV to include environmental sustainability in the agri-food sector, offering practical tips on leveraging servitization to decrease carbon footprints in emerging markets.

AB  - The global increase in greenhouse gas emissions presents an urgent environmental challenge, demanding innovative strategies for emission reduction and a fundamental shift in energy consumption practices. Co-processing biogenic feedstocks, such as used cooking oils and biocrudes derived from forest and agricultural residues, within existing oil refineries has been demonstrated as a cost-effective, scalable approach to producing low-carbon fuels, quickly helping the oil refiners to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions, leveraging the existing infrastructures. Despite its potential, monitoring the ”green” CO2 emissions originating from biogenic feedstocks during co-processing remains challenging. The molecular structure of biogenic components becomes indistinguishable from fossil-based molecules, necessitating costly, labor-intensive, and time-consuming sample collection and testing procedures, often involving isotope carbon analysis. This work proposes a new approach by applying artificial intelligence to model green CO2 emissions in real-time. By analyzing over 102,000 samples of industrial data from a commercial FCC unit, a robust machine learning framework is developed to provide continuous, cost-effective, and accurate green CO2 monitoring. The methodology encompasses a comparative analysis of ten input analysis techniques and five regression models to model emissions, achieving an average error margin of just 2.66% compared to traditional laboratory measurements. This AI-driven approach offers refiners and policymakers a practical tool for assessing the environmental performance of biogenic feedstock co-processing, facilitating informed decision-making in renewable fuel production.

AB  - Edge Computing (EC) is a recent architectural paradigm that brings computation close to end-users with the aim of reducing latency and bandwidth bottlenecks, which 5G technologies are committed to further reduce, while also achieving higher reliability. EC enables computation offloading from end devices to edge nodes. Deciding whether a task should be offloaded, or not, is not trivial. Moreover, deciding when and where to offload a task makes things even harder and making inadequate or off-time decisions can undermine the EC approach. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, such as Machine Learning (ML), have been used to help EC systems cope with this problem. AI promises accurate decisions, higher adaptability and portability, thus diminishing the cost of decision-making and the probability of error. In this work, we perform a literature review on computation offloading in EC systems with and without AI techniques. We analyze several AI techniques, especially ML-based, that display promising results, overcoming the shortcomings of current approaches for computing offloading coordination We sorted the ML algorithms into classes for better analysis and provide an in-depth analysis on the use of AI for offloading, in particular, in the use case of offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing Networks, actually one technology that gained more relevance in the last years, enabling a vast amount of solutions for computation and data offloading. We also discuss the main advantages and limitations of offloading, with and without the use of AI techniques.

AB  - Digital technologies are considered enablers of circular economy implementation in the built environment. Literature mainly focuses on conceptual or review studies examining the role of digital tools (e.g., material passport and building information modelling) to close the material loops. There is a lack of understanding of how digital technologies are implemented in real-life and whether they offer value to the industry actors. This study conducted a multiple-case study to collect empirical evidence from Dutch social housing organizations actively applying circular principles in new construction, renovation, maintenance, and demolition projects. Our findings suggest that artificial intelligence, digital twins, and scanning technologies support data collection, integration, and analysis for slowing the loops strategies (i.e., maintenance), while digital marketplaces facilitate material reuse, enabling narrowing and closing the loops. This study identified 12 challenges that hinder the broader adoption of digital technologies that are associated with the technological, cultural, market, and regulatory factors.

AB  - Passports for circularity, e.g., digital product passports and material passports (MPs), have gained recognition as essential policy instruments for the Circular Economy goals of the European Union. Despite the growing number of approaches, there is a lack of knowledge about the data requirements and availabilities to create MPs for existing buildings. By deploying a mixed-method research design, this study identified the potential users and their data needs within the context of European social housing organisations. Three rounds of validation interviews with a total of 38 participants were conducted to create a data template for an MP covering maintenance, renovation, and demolition stages. This data template was then tested in a case study from the Netherlands to determine critical data gaps in creating MPs, including, but not limited to the composition of materials, presence of toxic or hazardous contents, condition assessment, and reuse and recycling potential of a product. Finally, an MP framework is proposed to address these data gaps by utilising the capabilities of enabling digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and scanning systems) and supportive knowledge of human actors. This framework supports further research and innovation in data provision in creating MPs to narrow, slow, close, and regenerate the loops.

Thus it is crucial to research if decreasing energy use can genuinely boost green total factor productivity (GTFP) and how to reconcile the link between reducing energy consumption and GTFP using various technical approaches. This study proposes the two-way influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and natural resources market on GTFP. It comprehensively evaluates the effects of AI on green economic development using the instance of China and a pertinent mathematical model. We found that the impacts of AI on carbon intensity vary between industries and developmental phases. Compared to the 11th Five-Year Plan, AI significantly reduced carbon intensity during the 12th. Compared to capital-intensive businesses, labor- and technology-intensive industries likely have a more significant drop in carbon intensity due to AI and natural resources market.

AB  - The rapid growth of global energy demands and heightened environmental concerns highlight the critical need to transition to renewable energy sources. Identifying the influence of digitalization of ICT and global supply chains on sustainable practices to mitigate environmental impacts is crucial. This study aims to fill the research gap by examining the effects of manufacturing, digitalization of ICT, supply chain globalization, trade, and GDP on renewable energy consumption in the ASEAN countries. Utilized the Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR) and Prais-Winsten regression with Panel-Corrected Standard Errors (PCSEs) to analyze data from 1995 to 2023. The MMQR results show that manufacturing has overall positive effects at lower quantiles, while digital ICT and supply chain globalization have negative effects across all quantiles. Trade shows an insignificant impact on renewable energy, while economic growth shows a negative effect at higher quantities. The PCSEs model shows stronger negative effects of supply chain globalization and trade on renewable energy consumption. Such effects highlight the need for policy efforts to target the incorporation of renewable energy because of the manifold impacts of economic processes and technology developments.

AB  - This forward-looking perspective introduces the current applications of AI in sustainable energy systems, focusing on machine learning (ML) in three key areas: (i) system modeling and prediction, (ii) energy operation and management, and (iii) anomaly detection and diagnostics. For future low-carbon, decentralized and multi-energy systems, increasing complexity and communication pose challenges for system forecasting, operational control, grid planning, and energy security. AI offers revolutionary solutions by enhancing renewable energy integration, optimizing energy storage, and improving fault detection and cybersecurity. However, AI methods face limitations, including dependence on extensive data, lack of physical interpretability, and issues of transferability and robustness, hindering broader adoption in the energy sector. Therefore, perspectives are offered on four aspects: (1) developing generative AI to provide synthetic energy data, (2) adopting physics-informed AI to mitigate inherent AI limitations, (3) utilizing AI-based control and energy planning to address multi-energy complexities, and (4) implementing layered AI-based cybersecurity measures to defend smart energy systems. Overall, this perspective provides insights into the evolving role of AI in future energy systems.

AB  - The development and expansion of the digital economy, including the internet, big data, and cloud computing, provide a new impetus to reaching peak carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality. However, the impact and mechanism of the urban digital economy on carbon intensity are still insufficiently characterized. This study confirms a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between them by adding a quadratic term and conducting a U test. When the index of the digital economy exceeds 0.419, it reduces carbon emissions intensity. The empirical results indicate that the digital economy has a nonlinear spatial spillover effect on the carbon emission intensity of adjacent cities presenting a U-shape. The digital economy can not only directly affect carbon emission intensity, but also indirectly affects it by optimizing industrial structure and promoting scientific and technological innovation. The methodology of this paper can be used for future research, and the findings can support the regional development of the digital economy and the formulation of carbon reduction policies.

AB  - This study contributes to the existing literature by investigating and confirming a range of diverse outcomes related to the interplay of factors shaping the global energy transition (ET). Employing advanced methodologies, including the extension of the QVAR technique to short-term (SR), medium-term (MR), and long-term (LR) connectedness analysis, as well as the application of the CQ method to explore relationships within varying market conditions and timeframes, the study examines the interconnectedness of critical variables: artificial intelligence (AI), the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Paris Agreement (PA), green technologies (GT), geopolitical risk (GPR), and ET. The findings highlight several crucial insights. Firstly, all selected variables demonstrate substantial interconnectedness across different time horizons, except for MR, which exhibits comparatively weaker connectedness than SR and LR. Secondly, independent series reveal diverse impacts on ET across various market conditions and periods. For example, in SR, most series produce mixed effects on ET, with BRI having primarily adverse consequences and GPR predominantly yielding positive impacts. In MR, the influence of AI, PA, and GT on ET varies, while BRI enhances ET, and GPR essentially hampers it. Notably, in LR, AI, BRI, PA, and GT significantly promote ET, while GPR disrupts its progress. Additionally, the study underscores the dynamic and time-varying nature of the relationships between AI, BRI, PA, GT, GPR, and ET across different market conditions, thus holding essential implications for shaping global policies to foster sustainable energy transitions.

AB  - Pollution control and carbon emission reduction pose significant challenges for developing countries, and achieving synergistic reductions in pollution and carbon emissions (SRPCs) has emerged as the optimal choice. Digitization, a prevailing trend in the current era, presents new opportunities for realizing the SRPC. We utilize data from Chinese A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2022 to investigate the impact of corporate digital transformation on the SRPC. The research reveals the following. (1) Enterprise digital transformation significantly promotes the SRPC, a conclusion validated through a series of robustness tests. However, the SRPC resulting from digital transformation is characterized by weak synergy, which is primarily observed in the coordinated reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions. (2) This effect is notably stronger for companies near environmental regulatory authorities, those receiving government environmental subsidies, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). (3) Enhancing managerial collaborative management capabilities, promoting corporate technological innovation capabilities, and alleviating financing pressure are the primary mechanisms at play. This research provides important policy and practical insights for promoting the SRPC in the context of digitization, fostering sustainable development.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly adopted within Human Resource management (HRM) due to its potential to create value for consumers, employees, and organisations. However, recent studies have found that organisations are yet to experience the anticipated benefits from AI adoption, despite investing time, effort, and resources. The existing studies in HRM have examined the applications of AI, anticipated benefits, and its impact on human workforce and organisations. The aim of this paper is to systematically review the multi-disciplinary literature stemming from International Business, Information Management, Operations Management, General Management and HRM to provide a comprehensive and objective understanding of the organisational resources required to develop AI capability in HRM. Our findings show that organisations need to look beyond technical resources, and put their emphasis on developing non-technical ones such as human skills and competencies, leadership, team co-ordination, organisational culture and innovation mindset, governance strategy, and AI-employee integration strategies, to benefit from AI adoption. Based on these findings, we contribute five research propositions to advance AI scholarship in HRM. Theoretically, we identify the organisational resources necessary to achieve business benefits by proposing the AI capability framework, integrating resource-based view and knowledge-based view theories. From a practitioner’s standpoint, our framework offers a systematic way for the managers to objectively self-assess organisational readiness and develop strategies to adopt and implement AI-enabled practices and processes in HRM.

AB  - Corporate energy transition is crucial for long-term sustainable development. The widely discussed Artificial Intelligence (AI), as a disruptive technological innovation, is highly potential for enhancing environment performance. However, the specific impact of AI on the process of corporate energy transition and its underlying mechanisms have not been fully explored. This study focuses on A-share listed corporates in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets in China spanning from 2011 to 2021. Based on corporate annual report information and information from over 200,000 patent application texts, we innovatively construct indicators for corporate energy transition and AI technology application. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the impact of AI technology on corporate energy transition and its potential mechanisms through combining information asymmetry theory and institutional theory. The empirical results indicate that: 1) AI can drive corporate energy transition and the promoting effect of AI collaborative innovation on corporate energy transition should not be ignored. 2) AI can help corporates achieve energy transition through pathways such as mitigating information asymmetry, reducing financing constraints, adjusting sustainable development concepts and practices. 3) The driving effect of AI on corporate energy transition varies depending on the characteristics of different types of corporates, industries, and regions. This study provides strategic guidance and decision support for business managers and policymakers, assisting both corporates and governments in better utilizing AI technology during the social energy transition process to achieve a dual optimization of environmental and economic goals.

AB  - The urgency of addressing global challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, and environmental degradation has positioned the Circular Economy (CE) as a crucial strategy for sustainable development. Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies have been recognized as key enablers of CE. However, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding how organizations can effectively integrate these technologies with CE strategies. Existing integration frameworks often focus narrowly on specific industries, technologies, or the traditional 3R model, neglecting the broader 10R framework and, hence, offering limited guidance. This paper addresses these gaps by developing a comprehensive 10R-based integration framework, providing practical guidance on how I4.0 technologies can support the full range of CE strategies. Using a literature review based on keywords’ clusters analysis, this study explores how I4.0 can support both implementation and decision-making in the CE 10Rs, providing a practical guide for businesses and supporting a broader shift towards sustainable business models. The results show that IoT, Big Data, and Digital Twins effectively support Rs related to smarter product use and manufacturing processes. Additive Manufacturing, Augmented/Virtual Reality, and Cognitive Twins are crucial in extending the lifespan of products or components. IoT, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and human-robot collaboration can improve recycling practices and material recovery. The study reveals that while ’Reduce’ and ’Recycle’ dominate the literature, integrating I4.0 technologies with lesser-explored strategies like ’Reuse,’ ’Repurpose,’ ’Refurbish,’ and ’Remanufacture’ offers significant potential for future research. It also stresses the need to assess the energy and environmental impacts of I4.0 technologies themselves in the CE context.

AB  - This chapter will focus on the area of human emotion as the field of emotional AI or empathic AI is emerging and creating new possibilities—and ethical issues. Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved into multiple spheres of everyday life and is quickly proving capable of affecting how we live, work and play in the world—with sometimes severe differences in usage, acceptance, legalities, and ethical practices both between countries and within countries. These discrepancies and ethical debates are only going to become more complex. Intelligence is no longer unique to the human species, therefore challenging the definition of what it means to be human. Our chapter uses three cases studies to illustrate how empathy is germane to intimacy, planetary survival, and recognition. Apart from the need to find the right amount and approach of empathy within AI systems to mitigate detrimental emotional effects on humans, there should also be an approach to bring empathy across all AI technologies, irrespective of having Emotional AI (EAI) as a focal point. In addition, there is reason to believe that adding empathy as an extra layer of ethics into official guidelines is not only necessary but desirable, ensuring that the increase of standardization and generalization in the AI field does not invalidate individuality. A lack of empathy could be considered as unethical in itself, so the ongoing developments in the field of empathy and AI and the link between both is to be welcomed.

AB  - In this paper, we develop the optimal minimum-energy scheduler for the dynamic online joint allocation of the task sizes, computing rates, communication rates and communication powers in virtualized Networked Data Centers (NetDCs) that operates under hard per-job delay-constraints. The referred NetDC’s infrastructure is composed by multiple frequency-scalable Virtual Machines (VMs), that are interconnected by a bandwidth and power-limited switched Local Area Network (LAN). Due to the nonlinear power-vs.-communication rate relationship, the resulting Computing-Communication Optimization Problem (CCOP) is inherently nonconvex. In order to analytically compute the exact solution of the CCOP, we develop a solving approach that relies on the following two main steps: (i) we prove that the CCOP retains a loosely coupled structure, that allows us to perform the lossless decomposition of the CCOP into the cascade of two simpler sub-problems; and, (ii) we prove that the coupling between the aforementioned sub-problems is provided by a (scalar) constraint, that is linear in the offered workload. The resulting optimal scheduler is amenable of scalable and distributed online implementation and its analytical characterization is in closed-form. After numerically testing its actual performance under randomly time-varying synthetically generated and real-world measured workload traces, we compare the obtained performance with the corresponding ones of some state-of-the-art static and sequential schedulers.

AB  - This study investigates the interconnectedness of Digital Sustainability (DS) and Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR), through a dual-track systematic literature review, analyzing 202 scholarly works from Web of Science and Scopus. The review is based both on bibliometric and content analyses in order to map current knowledge on these two theoretical constructs. By collecting and comparing definitions and key topics, the review revealed that DS and CDR are treated separately in the current literature, missing their potential synergies—DS often overlooks ethical implications, while CDR neglects broader sustainability impacts. However, notable convergences emerged, leading to the development of an integrated Corporate Digital Sustainability (CDS) framework. This framework leverages digital technologies as a cross-cutting enabler and systematizes values, objectives, dimensions, practices, and aspects to guide corporations in navigating the complexities of digital sustainability while achieving responsible digital progress. The study concludes by proposing a research agenda to guide future explorations in this promising direction.

AB  - Economies are struggling to achieve a low-carbon transition while also fostering increased digitalisation. EU-level targets for renewable generation, emissions reduction and energy efficiency present a unique challenge for Ireland which features substantial intermittent renewable generation, limited district heating and data centres forecast to consume 37% of national electricity demand by 2028. This study quantifies the key private and public benefits associated with large-scale adoption of energy efficiency technology for data centre cooling. It considers technology that provides cooling to data centres, surplus hot water supply and electricity storage. A unique plant-level model informs a national forecast of data centre energy savings and estimates of hot water supply for use in district heating. National public benefits of adoption are quantified using a power systems model (ENGINE) of the Irish transmission system, subject to 2030 climate policy constraints. Results show that technology adoption could lower sectoral energy use by 26% and supply 12.40 TWh of hot water for a 4th generation district heating network. Technology adoption could reduce renewable electricity generation requirements by 6.92% and lower system-wide emissions by 3%. Results highlight the potential for technology adoption to deliver multiple benefits to private and public stakeholders.

AB  - Many policy makers and corporate leaders are adjusting their strategies to harness the power of GenAI. There are numerous debates on how GenAI would fundamentally change existing business models. However, there is not much discussion on roles of generative AI in the domain of social good. Broader views covering potential opportunities of GenAI to enable diverse initiatives in the social good space are largely missing. We intend to reduce the gap by developing a classification framework that should allow researchers gauge the potential impact of GenAI for social good initiatives. Through case analysis, we assess how value-added abilities of GenAI may influence various social good initiatives. We adopt/develop two loosely connected classification frameworks that are grounded in task-technology fit (TTF) theory. Subsequently, we investigate how our analyses of GenAI initiatives utilizing different dimensions of these two frameworks may be synthesized to provide appropriate explanation for potential success of GenAI for social good. We develop five propositions that will provide guidance to practitioners and researchers. The theoretically grounded analysis of 21 GenAI for social good use cases based on the two classification frameworks, and the resulting propositions are the original contributions of this paper to the AI for social good literature.

The future of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in green analytics is bright. Ongoing advancements in NIR technology, coupled with increased accessibility and integration with advanced multivariate data analysis such as machine learning and artificial intelligence will further amplify the impact of NIRS across food, agricultural, environmental, and renewable energy domains. The miniaturization, increased portability, and enhanced affordability of NIR instruments, coupled with its integration into emerging technologies, will empower a diverse range of industries and researchers to address pressing global challenges with unprecedented precision and efficiency. The implementation of NIR technology in process analytical technology will enable the transition to future digitalized and sustainable food production. In a future circular economy, where waste streams, co-products and water are reclaimed and valorized, continuous measurements are necessary and in many cases, there are no sensor alternatives to NIR technology.

In the last years, there has been an increasing interest in how CS can contribute to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that aim to reach a sustainable future. Research about data quality has taught us that through using an appropriate methodology, CS can foster scientific knowledge and promote specific actions to achieve accomplish goals. However, there is not much information about the SDGs that CS is more interested in. This paper presents a long-term study on how CS discuss about SDGs in Twitter, aiming to classify the discussion around the SDGs. The paper reports on a variety of topics such as open science, innovation and biodiversity, among others, but the results show that the most addressed topic in CS discussions in Twitter is about climate change, with corresponds to the SDG 13. Based on these findings, it is possible to affirm that climate change is a hot topic in CS in Twitter. However, there are also other SDGs that although underrepresented, are also discussed in CS.

AB  - E-waste is one of the most pressing concerns confronting the push toward a greener economy. Recycling is the only known solution to the E-Waste problem. However, global recycling rates remain dismal. Even in the EU, which is the world leader in E-Waste recycling, only 35% of E-Waste is officially recognized as collected and recycled. The global average is 20%; the remaining 80% is undocumented, with much ending up buried under the ground for centuries as a landfill. The existing systems attempt to solve the problem of E-Waste Disposal effectively with the help of smart bins, smart contacts, and other Blockchain technology that work effectively on an industry scale, but when E-Waste management is considered for retail consumers and households, numerous issues remain unsolved. The proposed approach includes Smart contracts to personalize E-Waste pickup. Hyperledger Blockchain is used as a framework for a single organization to establish a network into which several organizations can join and participate. Blockchain provides various benefits, including immutability and transparency, which are taken advantage of in the suggested approach. Tokens are used as the method of compensation.

AB  - In today’s digital era, access to technology and internet connectivity is vital for socioeconomic progress. Despite significant progress in technical methods of providing connectivity, a digital divide persists, hindering equal access to digital resources. Second hand or refurbished mobile phones offer a solution by providing affordable access to technology to economically disadvantaged people. Through refurbishment, used phones are restored to like-new condition, reducing e-waste and extending their lifespan. This aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting responsible consumption and reducing inequalities. Environmental assessments show significant benefits, with refurbished phones reducing up to $87 \%$ of environmental impact. However, concerns remain about performance and reliability. This research aims to address these concerns by analyzing refurbishment processes and establishing trust standards. It explores the potential of the refurbished phone market for digital inclusion, discussing regulatory considerations and role of government in stimulating market growth. The paper examines benefits for companies and consumers, along with challenges and proposed solutions, ultimately aiming to enhance digital inclusion.

AB  - Amidst the ongoing climate crisis, there is a pressing need to reduce energy consumption - especially in industrial settings, as recognized by the United Nations Sustainability Goals (in particular, 9 and 12). To mitigate energy usage in production, strategically grouping compatible jobs and processing them together in batches, as captured by batch scheduling problems, is often beneficial. The Oven Scheduling Problem (OSP), is an NP-hard real-world parallel batch scheduling problem that arises in the electronic component industry. The goal of the OSP is to schedule jobs on ovens while minimizing total oven operating time, job tardiness, and setup costs. To reduce oven runtime, compatible jobs can be processed simultaneously in batches. The schedule must respect oven eligibility and availability, job release dates, setup times between batches, and oven capacity constraints.We propose and fine-tune a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm that uses three different destroy operators and a repair operator based on an exact method (a Constraint Programming model). Our findings demonstrate that LNS significantly enhances the solution quality for many large instances compared to existing exact methods from the literature. Furthermore, we develop a user-friendly dashboard to facilitate decision-makers in the navigation of the optimization tool.

AB  - The burgeoning capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) have prompted numerous local governments worldwide to consider its integration into their operations. Nevertheless, instances of notable AI failures have heightened ethical concerns, emphasising the imperative for local governments to approach the adoption of AI technologies in a responsible manner. While local government AI guidelines endeavour to incorporate characteristics of responsible innovation and technology (RIT), it remains essential to assess the extent to which these characteristics have been integrated into policy guidelines to facilitate more effective AI governance in the future. This study closely examines local government policy documents (n = 26) through the lens of RIT, employing directed content analysis with thematic data analysis software. The results reveal that: (a) Not all RIT characteristics have been given equal consideration in these policy documents; (b) Participatory and deliberate considerations were the most frequently mentioned responsible AI characteristics in policy documents; (c) Adaptable, explainable, sustainable, and accountable considerations were the least present responsible AI characteristics in policy documents; (d) Many of the considerations overlapped with each other as local governments were at the early stages of identifying them. Furthermore, the paper summarised strategies aimed at assisting local authorities in identifying their strengths and weaknesses in responsible AI characteristics, thereby facilitating their transformation into governing entities with responsible AI practices. The study informs local government policymakers, practitioners, and researchers on the critical aspects of responsible AI policymaking.

AB  - The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector faces severe sustainability and efficiency challenges. The application of artificial intelligence in green building (AI-in-GB) is an effective solution to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the sector. While studies have been conducted in the AI-in-GB domain, an in-depth study on the state-of-the-art of AI-in-GB research is hitherto lacking. To provide a better understanding of this underexplored area, this study was initiated via a bibliometric-systematic analysis method. The study aims to reveal the synthesis between AI and GB, as well as to highlight research trends along with knowledge gaps that may be tackled in future AI-in-GB research. A quantitative bibliometric analysis was conducted to objectively identify the major research hotspots, trends, knowledge gaps and future research needs based on 383 research publications identified from Scopus. A further qualitative systematic analysis was also conducted on 76 screened research publications on AI-in-GB. Through this mixed-methods systematic review, knowledge gaps were identified, and future research directions of AI-in-GB were proposed as follows: digital twins and AI of things; blockchain; robotics and 4D printing; and legal, ethical, and moral responsibilities of AI-in-GB. This study adds to the GB knowledge domain by synthesizing the state-of-the-art of AI-in-GB and revealing the research needs in this field to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the AEC sector.

AB  - In recent years, there have been many fundamental changes in the architecture of modern data centers. New applications have emerged, including cloud computing, big data analytics, real-time stock trading, and more. Workloads have evolved from a predominantly static environment into one that changes over time in response to user demands, often as part of a highly virtualized, multitenant data center. In response to these new requirements, data center networks have also undergone significant change. Conventional network architectures, which use Ethernet access, aggregation, and core tiers with a separate storage area network, are not well suited to modern data center traffic patterns. This chapter reviews the evolution from conventional network architectures into designs better suited to dynamic, distributed workloads. This includes flattening the network, converging Ethernet with storage and other protocols, and virtualizing and scaling the network. Effects of oversubscription, latency, higher data rates, availability, reliability, energy efficiency, and network security will be discussed.

AB  - Energy poverty is a global challenge that constrains economic development, jeopardizes people's health, and impedes the improvement of people's lives. Artificial intelligence (AI) could be an important tool to reverse this dilemma. We utilize a panel data covering 64 countries during 2000–2019 to examine AI's impact on energy poverty. The findings reveal that the application of AI effectively alleviates energy poverty. After a series of robustness checks, this conclusion remains valid. Moreover, heterogeneity tests show that AI significantly alleviates energy poverty in high-income countries and lower-middle-income countries, but this positive influence is not found in upper-middle-income countries. Mechanism tests indicate that the application of AI can generate economic effects, driving technological progress and enhancing human capital, thereby easing energy poverty. Further discussion reveals AI's impact on energy poverty is long-lasting. In addition, its effects are more prominent in countries that do not participate in cooperative organizations. Our findings offer a fresh perspective and approach to improving the global state of energy poverty. Based on these conclusions, we provide relevant policy implications.

AB  - Recent substantial advancements in computational techniques, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), have raised the demand for smart self-powered devices. But since energy use is a worldwide issue that needs to be resolved immediately, cutting-edge technology should reduce energy consumption without affecting smart applications. Energy harvesting technology convert mechanical vibrations from the environment into electrical energy. Emerging AI technology which intends to meet the challenges of real world applications has open an interesting platform for some energy harvesting technologies, particularly piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENG) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). In this context, advancements in AI technologies for data processing in PENG and TENG are discussed. A brief discussion about the combination of NG output with machine learning algorithms applied to a range of applications, such as robotics, intelligent security systems, medical systems, sports, acoustic sensors, and object recognition, is provided. The primary challenges and potential alternatives of these technologies are also discussed.

AB  - Studies have shown that much of today’s data centers are over-provisioned and underutilized. Over-provisioning cannot be avoided as these centers must anticipate peak load with bursty behavior. Under-utilization, to date, has also been unavoidable as systems always had to be ready for that sudden burst of requests that loom just around the corner. Previous research has pointed to turning off systems as one solution, albeit, an infeasible one due to its irresponsiveness. In this paper, we present the feasibility of using new Storage Class Memory (SCM, which encompasses specific developments such as PCM, MRAM, or FeRAM) technology to turn systems on and off with minimum overhead. This feature is used to control systems on the whole (in comparison to the previous fine-grained component-wise control) in finer time scale for high responsiveness with minimized power lost to idleness. Our empirical study is done by executing real trace-like workloads on a prototype data center of embedded systems deploying FeRAM. We quantify the energy savings and performance trade-off by turning idle systems off. We show that our energy savings approach consumes energy in proportion to user requests with configurable quality of service. Finally, based on observations made on this data center, we discuss the requirements for real deployment.

AB  - Hong Kong has planned to achieve zero-carbon emissions before 2050. Hong Kong's building sector is responsible for approximately 60 % of carbon emissions, while its evolutionary trajectories and neutrality pathway remain unclear. To this end, we adopt the STIRPAT model and machine learning approach to identify the most relevant factors and determine their historical correlation with building energy consumption. Then, the out-of-sample prediction is conducted to explore the energy pathway and carbon footprint towards 2050 in the Hong Kong building sector under various assumptions and scenarios. The predicted results suggest that electricity consumption and carbon emissions will continue to increase following current trends. In a moderate scenario, if 2.2 % and 1.6 % of residential and commercial buildings are replaced annually with 2.75 % better energy-performance construction, their electricity consumption is likely to reach 30 %–40 % and 20 %–30 % from the 2015 level as the HK2050 required. With lower electricity emission intensity, the Hong Kong building sector could achieve near zero emissions. Our projection is valuable for developing energy-saving and emission-mitigation strategies towards various carbon neutrality goals in the building sector.

AB  - The global burden of skin diseases affects over 3 billion individuals, posing important public health challenges worldwide, with profound impacts in both high-income and low-income and middle-income countries. These challenges are exacerbated by widespread disparities in access to dermatologic care and the prevalence of misinformation. This article, derived from the Skin and Digital Summit at the International Master Course on Aging Science critically evaluates how digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, teledermatology, and large language models can bridge these access gaps. It explores practical applications and case studies demonstrating the impact of these technologies in various settings, with a particular focus on adapting solutions to meet the diverse needs of low-income and middle-income countries. In addition, the narrative highlights the ongoing conversation within the dermatologic community about the role of digital advances in health care, emphasizing that this discussion is dynamic and the one that is continuously evolving. Dermatologists play an essential role in this transition, integrating digital tools into mainstream care to complement a patient-centered, culturally sensitive approach. The article advocates for a globally coordinated digital response that not only addresses current disparities in skin health care but also promotes equitable access to digital health resources, making dermatologic care more representative of all skin types and accessible worldwide.

AB  - Energy efficiency improvements leading to cleaner output have recently emerged as a hot topic in sustainable development research. At this time, OECD nations are not generating enough money to guarantee that energy efficiency measures can be purchased. Artificial intelligence (AI) is causing a revolution in optimizing energy efficiency by allowing for sophisticated analysis and management of energy systems. Thus, in this stage of digital economic growth, energy resilience might be impacted by the fast development of AI technology, the energy internet, and other emerging forms of the network economy. This study aims to analyze the effects of digitalization in the supply chain, artificial intelligence, and finance on energy resilience (ENR) in seventeen OECD countries by using panel data from 2006 to 2021. Three dynamic panel data models are employed: one-step difference GMM, one-step system GMM, and two-step system GMM. The findings show that population growth and tax environmental regulations decrease energy resilience in OECD countries. On the other hand, digitalization of the supply chain, advancements in finance, and AI have increased energy resilience. Moreover, the study uses SQR and panel quantile regression (PQR) tests to ensure that the dynamic panel model is robust. Based on the findings, significant policy implications are proposed to enhance energy quality in OECD nations. Finally, AI has enormous potential to improve energy efficiency by facilitating more innovative optimization and management of energy systems. Organizations may save much money, cut expenses, and help build a better energy future by using AI to save energy.

AB  - Water pollution traceability is a critical component of environmental management, essential for ensuring the safety of water supplies and maintaining ecological balance. Although many countries have established relatively mature water environment quality monitoring (WEQM) systems, these systems often face limitations such as inadequate professional sensing equipment, insufficient model stability, and high technical expertise requirements. Monitoring, early warning, and traceability of water pollution in complex watersheds remain challenging tasks. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data is driving the digital transformation of traditional WEQM systems, significantly enhancing their capabilities in digitalization, intelligence, and networking. This perspective paper examines the potential impacts of emerging technologies such as AI and big data on water environment monitoring and pollution traceability in watersheds. It identifies innovation barriers and the transformation potential of WEQM systems from various perspectives, including monitoring and early warning systems, pollution location and tracking, fingerprint spectroscopy technology, and the detection of new pollutants. This exploration aims to provide insights and inspiration for the accurate diagnosis of water pollution and the enhancement of global environmental monitoring systems.

AB  - The concept of sustainable development assumes a holistic approach to the development of the economy, society, and the biosphere. Many scientists and politicians today consider the regional level the main one in the implementation of sustainable development goals since any region is characterized by the interconnection of economic, social, and natural indicators that form a single system. Therefore, today the regions are becoming significant objects of economic and political relations. Determining the specifics and priorities of their development are urgent problems. The use of statistical methods and models is one of the tools for making informed decisions on a scientific basis in solving this problem. Correlation, regression, and factor analysis of the Lipetsk region's socio-economic indicators made it possible to identify the main trends and determine their compliance with the sustainable development goals.

AB  - The digital transformation of society presents potential solutions to achieve goals, such as ending poverty, mitigating climate change impacts, promoting human equality, and other challenges identified in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. At the same time, the digital transformation is responsible for new challenges—such as fake news, Internet addiction, and cyberbullying—and for potentially promoting new sources of inequality and discrimination. For its complex, uncertain and evaluative nature, the digital transformation is one of the “grand challenges” of our time. Robust actions are lines of action that allow organizations to tackle grand challenges and formulate specific robust strategies (Ferraro et al., Organization Studies, 2015). This article investigates the practices and mechanisms included in the robust actions and strategies to improve information society assessments (ISA), i.e., measurements of the digital transformation of society. We investigated Cetic.br, a Brazilian ISA organization, to learn how ISA contributes to respond to the grand challenge of digital transformation from a management perspective. Beyond the measurement processes that represent a robust action to tackle the grand challenge of the digital transformation of society, the study of the Cetic.br case help us to improve the understanding on robust strategies implementation to the level of practices and mechanisms comprising them.

AB  - Both the pandemic and the global climate changes accelerate the need for urgent solutions to guarantee humanity's sustainable and prosperous future. Remarkably, at the 10-year mark of introducing Industry 4.0, the adverse effects arising from adopting absolute technocentric perspectives are now evident. Scholars and practitioners claim new plans for a future where technology empowers people and innovation works for business and society. Humans and machines are expected to reconcile and work in symbiosis, supporting the emergence of Super Smart Societies (S5.0), the last ones based on human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience. Despite the mentioned, guidelines on how technocentric and human-centric innovations should combine to trigger S5.0 are still missing. Depending on the above, this article aims to design a comprehensive framework based on the Quintuple Helix Model, supporting the design and the implementation of S5.0. In doing so, several prescriptions on how Government, University, Industry, Civil Society, and Environment may address the goals of S5.0 are provided.

AB  - In response to the growing emphasis on sustainability in federated learning (FL), this research introduces a dynamic, dual-objective optimization framework called carbon-conscious federated reinforcement learning (CCFRL). By leveraging reinforcement learning (RL), CCFRL continuously adapts client allocation and resource usage in real time, optimizing both carbon efficiency and model performance. Unlike static or greedy methods that prioritize short-term carbon constraints, existing approaches often suffer from either degrading model performance by excluding high-quality, energy-intensive clients or failing to adequately balance carbon emissions with long-term efficiency. CCFRL addresses these limitations by taking a more sustainable method, balancing immediate resource needs with long-term sustainability, and ensuring that energy consumption and carbon emissions are minimized without compromising model quality, even with nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) and large-scale datasets. We overcome the shortcomings of existing methods by integrating advanced state representations, adaptive exploration and exploitation transitions, and stagnating detection using t-tests to better manage real-world data heterogeneity and complex, nonlinear datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCFRL significantly reduces both energy consumption and carbon emissions while maintaining or enhancing performance. With up to a 61.78% improvement in energy conservation and a 64.23% reduction in carbon emissions, CCFRL proves the viability of aligning resource management with sustainability goals, paving the way for a more environmentally responsible future in cloud computing.

AB  - The environmental impact of digital advertising is the subject of debate. Effective media planning and content management are crucial for capturing audience attention and achieving objectives such as brand recognition, increased traffic, user engagement, and loyalty building. However, few studies highlight the risks of prioritizing economic gains over ecological sustainability and the massive tons of CO2 emissions that an average digital ad campaign generates. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature by introducing the novel framework of emission-smart advertising that balances the performance of digital advertising and CO2 emissions reduction. A two-phase methodology combined a qualitative study and the Delphi method. Based on our findings, we elaborate on innovative and rarely discussed theoretical, managerial, and community contributions. These contributions concern solutions merging media performance evaluation and reduction of CO2 emissions of digital ad campaigns, as well as the optimization process at all stages, including energy saving, choice, formats, data, and key performance indicators.

AB  - The field of smart cities has seen significant advancements in recent years to improve citizens' quality of life. Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing (EC), along with Artificial Intelligence (AI), are being utilized to achieve this goal. This study focuses on a specific branch of IoT known as Visual IoT, which uses digital cameras as sensors and relies on visual data. Advances in AI have enabled researchers to integrate AI models into camera-based edge devices, increasing the use of AI-powered Visual IoT systems in smart cities. However, since the energy consumption in battery-powered systems is naturally a concern, being deployed outdoors for visual data gathering with the integration of AI-based processing raises a significant challenge. This paper examines AI-powered Visual IoT systems in smart cities with a special emphasis on energy efficiency. Our goal is not only to evaluate how AI is used in Visual IoT systems in the context of smart cities but also to evaluate the level of consideration given to the energy efficiency aspect in the reviewed studies. Furthermore, we explore all of the methods used to address it. Through our work, readers will gain insights into the current landscape of Visual IoT in smart cities and an understanding of how much importance is placed on energy consumption in AI-integrated solutions.

AB  - Renewable energy consumption (REC) is not the only potent tool that can ameliorate the difficulties associated with rising CO2 emissions and ecological distortions. Besides, the role of ICT penetration and education on environmental quality cannot be overshadowed by their contributions to economic growth and improved human well-being. This study scrutinizes the effects of ICT, education, and REC on the ecological footprint (EF) and CO2 emissions in the IMF-selected emerging economies. The study utilizes three variables for the ICT index, computed through principal component analysis. The augmented mean group estimator results suggest that ICT, education, and REC reduce the EF, whereas FDI contributes significantly to environmental degradation. On the flip side, ICT reduces CO2 emissions and EF in both the medium and upper quantiles. It suggests that ICT penetration heals the environment and that a higher level of ICT consumption could be a panacea for sustainable development in emerging economies. The causality results show evidence of a feedback causality between economic growth, REC, and CO2 emissions. However, a unidirectional causality flows from economic growth and FDI to EF. Finally, to maximize the benefits associated with the positive effects of REC and ICT on environmental betterment, several renewable energy and ICT policies have been mentioned and discussed.

AB  - With the growing urbanized population, vertical farming becomes indispensable in eradicating hunger and ensuring food security for the future. Food security has become a major challenge for the future owing to the scarcity of land, rising global population, urbanization, and polluted soil and water resources. In this scenario, vertical farming as an innovative food production technology caters increased productivity with limited resources and improved carbon footprint. The review begins with a brief introduction to the concept of vertical farming, its opportunities and implications on the economy, environment, and society as a whole, following with an in-depth qualitative analysis of the cutting-edge innovations/technologies are presented in detail. Contrary to the numerous research focusing on mere analysis of economic viability and statistical analysis, the aim is to introduce real cutting-edge technologies that address the challenges of vertical farms such as lack of technical skills or energy requirements. The recent advances of vertical farms includes construction of outer vertical structure and growing shelves using light weight and transparent polymer composites, engineered and tunable LEDs lightings, 3-D printed and recyclable growing substrates, AI-integrated IoTs for environment control, harvesting materials for renewable energy storage etc. Such material innovations with inclusion of AI and robotics transform automated vertical farming into ‘state of the art’ agricultural technology. Production shelf fabricated using UV cured GBOV-glass fiber composite with 60% transparency can overcome the material weight limitation, corrosion, light obstructions etc. associated with the conventional steel shelves. Replacing non-renewable fossil fuels using renewable energy harvested by carbon dots, fluorescent materials, and perovskite solar cells is recommended to minimize the high capital investments associated with energy as well as to reduce the environmental impact. Smart materials such as phase change materials and thermoresponsive windows control the amount of energy expended whereas smart substrate promotes resource management. Application of the newest technology AI in vertical farming facilitates precise control of environment, early pest detection, automation of farming processes, data-driven decision making and precision agriculture. In short, vertical farms utilizing modern innovations of science and technology caters enhanced productivity, improved quality, reduced cost, resource management and sustainability. Hence, automated and sustainable vertical farms promoting global food security and circularity have the potential to transform into burgeoning technology of future.

AB  - We promote a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental costs associated with AI and “clouds” by raising awareness about the resource and emission-intensive nature of Artificial Intelligence through the use of data centres. While acknowledging the potential sustainability benefits of a green digital transformation, we challenge perceptions of a virtual and dematerialised industry often reinforced through the cloud metaphor. Using the planetary boundary (PB) framework, we go beyond conventional assessments of carbon emissions during a data centre's operational state to train AI and explore their multiple impacts on different Earth systems throughout the entire hardware lifecycle. For each stage of AI's hardware lifecycle, it is necessary to ascertain whether the environmental impacts associated with that stage can be quantified in a manner that allows for comparison with the control variables defined in the PB framework. In a second phase of the study, we examine the geographical distribution of individual lifecycle stages in order to assess the relative vulnerability of countries to the environmental harms associated with AI development stages. By mapping the lifecycle stages around the world, it becomes evident that the extraction, manufacturing, and disposal of AI hardware have a significant detrimental impact on the environment and populations in the Global South (the Majority World), while the benefits of AI development and use are largely concentrated in the West (the Minority World). Our findings underscore the need to scrutinize the benefits and costs associated with AI. To address the issue, it is proposed that more robust environmental policy obligations be introduced for electronic products throughout their entire lifecycle.

AB  - In light of the challenges posed by depleting energy resources and environmental degradation, the effective use of renewable energy is becoming ever more crucial. This study mainly investigates the role of ICT as a driver of renewable energy consumption in Africa. Furthermore, the study aims to emphasize the moderating effects of economic growth and structural transformation. To achieve this, the study employs the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) estimator on a panel of 45 African countries over the period 2000–2019. The findings show that internet and ICT service export promotes the use of renewable energy consumption, suggesting that the African nations examined have realized improvements in their energy mix as a result of ICT development. The moderating effects reveal that upgrading the energy consumption structure affected by digitalization is more significant in countries with high economic growth and more service-oriented. Our findings lead to a discussion of policy implications in relation to sustainable development goals (SDG).

AB  - Alongside many studies on greening efforts for supply chain activities, there is a research gap in understanding the emergence and adoption of green supply chain innovation (GSCI) in this digital-enabled Industry 4.0 era. This study defines GSCI as innovation practices by manufacturers that apply emergent digital technologies to integrate environmental concerns into supply chain management activities. GSCI is evolving as a new paradigm of green supply chain management (GSCM) to elevate its five underlying implementation dimensions. Manufacturing enterprises can benefit from digital technology applications to enhance efficiency of environmental outcomes of their GSCM activities, including internal environmental management, green purchasing, customer cooperation, inventory recovery, and eco-design. The GSCI concept gains growing attention in research and practice with popular digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data analytics increasingly adopted by manufacturers to improve their GSCM. So far, the literature lacks studies on GSCI to examine the concept, investigate the practices, explain the adoption motivations, consolidate and extend the knowledge on its adoption and diffusion. Based on a comprehensive review of GSCM literature, we explain the innovation for GSCM, and discuss the GSCI concept and practice focusing on digital technology applications with examples, and identify the challenges and opportunities for GSCI adoption and diffusion. We extend knowledge for this emerging GSCM field on digital technology applications.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proved to be an important engine of green economic development, yet how it will affect the internal structure of green economy is unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the impact and its mechanism of AI on green total factor productivity (GTFP) from the internal-structure perspective, by using provincial panel data of China from 2009 to 2021 and global Malmquist index. The main research results show that: (1) the development of AI contributes to China's GTFP growth. And this effect is more significant in undeveloped areas; (2) AI promotes China's GTFP growth mainly by improving resource allocation efficiency, while it exerts little impact through the paths of technological progress and scale efficiency; (3) the transmission mechanism of AI on GTFP varies greatly among China's three main regions. In the eastern region, AI improves GTFP mainly by both advancing technological progress and improving resource allocation efficiency, while in central region AI contributes to GTFP growth mainly through technological progress. Compared with the eastern and central regions, AI in the western region plays a stronger impact on GTFP through the channel of improving scale efficiency. This study helps to understand the pathways of artificial intelligence affecting the transformation of green economic growth and formulate differentiated regional policies in light of local conditions.

This study aims to investigate the antecedents (both drivers and barriers) of smart city system adoption, specifically those that incorporate artificial intelligence, and to analyse their effects on behavioral outcomes—more specifically, well-being and individual impact. The proposed model was tested using structural equation modelling with data from a survey of 211 individuals in Portugal. The main findings indicate that ubiquity and gamification were the most influential drivers of smart city system adoption. Conversely, perceived risks associated with these systems hindered their adoption. Additionally, our study demonstrated that trust significantly interacts with empowerment, perceived risk, and usage intention. Finally, usage intention was found to have a positive impact on well-being and individual outcomes in daily life.

AB  - Digital fabrication with concrete has been touted as an avenue to more sustainable construction through more material efficient design, but notably has produced materials with higher carbon footprints and a strong likelihood of reduced durability compared to standard construction. In this short article, a relationship to give a sense of the environmental impact of a structure is introduced, and it is emphasized that shape efficiency is the only unique environmental benefit that digital concrete brings. However, efforts should still continue to bring digital concrete more in line with standard concrete, especially through incorporation of large aggregates and better characterizing the durability. Finally, it is shown that while most 3D printed concretes appear to be overdesigned due to processing requirements, the use of aluminum based accelerators in a 2K system can be beneficial in decoupling buildability from structural strength, allowing greater freedom to lower carbon footprints in mix design.

AB  - This paper presents an idea analysis of AI in the policy documents and reports of the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Economic Forum. The three organisations expect AI to contribute to sustainability and a prosperous future with better data analysis, greater amounts of quantitative knowledge, and by making economic and social activities less wasteful and more energy efficient. Several challenges are also named: ethics, human rights, cybersecurity, access to reliable data, transparency, and the digital gap. The solutions presented are multi-stakeholder collaboration, cohesive but flexible governance frameworks, but also taking the lead to push for ethical and value-based AI and making sure AI is sustainable. Ideas about AI appear to stem from discourses of ecological modernisation and green governmentality. This framing turns political and structural challenges into technical issues to be solved with more data, greater collaboration, and technical progress. The similarities in ideas between the EU, the UN, and the World Economic Forum also suggest that ideas about AI and sustainable development have reached discourse institutionalisation. Ideas about AI are therefore likely to reinforce already existing institutional and discursive settings.

AB  - Summary In this paper, we critique ICT's current and projected climate impacts. Peer-reviewed studies estimate ICT's current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.8%–2.8% of global GHG emissions; adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we find that this share could actually be between 2.1% and 3.9%. For ICT's future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts' projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of policy mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that, without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector's footprint aligned with the Paris Agreement.

AB  - In this rapidly evolving era of smart city initiatives, the need for innovative, inclusive, and sustainable solutions is paramount. Existing approaches often prioritise technology over social, economic, and environmental factors, limiting their ability to tackle critical challenges in urban, regional, and rural environments. To address these limitations, a collaborative and participatory approach to smart city design has gained momentum, emphasising inclusivity and shared ownership. This workshop seeks to establish best practices for evolving human-computer interaction design, aligning with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. It explores the implications of technological advancements such as AI and the metaverse, aiming to ensure their integration supports principles of fairness, transparency, and social equity. Furthermore, it addresses the importance of "designing over a distance" to promote global collaboration and problem-solving. We are specifically interested in ways of “designing smart” by engaging and working with communities to address complex challenges, such as social inequality, economic disparity and environmental degradation, to build more sustainable, resilient and socially “just” communities.

AB  - Meeting the targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, which focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, poses significant challenges. Overcoming these hurdles requires innovative solutions that can bridge the gap between current capabilities and future needs. Swarm electrification emerges as a promising concept that could accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 7 goals by leveraging the collective power of decentralized energy resources. This paper presents a literature review on swarm electrification and related insights from case studies. The study delves into the concept of swarm electrification, placing it within the context of the prevailing trends in the power system sector: decentralization, decarbonization, and digitalization. It examines the role of digital technologies in enhancing swarm electrification and categorizes application areas according to the phases of swarm electrification. Particular attention is given to the technologies underpinning Deep Digitalization, such as distributed ledger technology, notably blockchain, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on machine learning. These technologies play pivotal roles in advancing swarm electrification. The review demonstrates how deep digitalization can facilitate the improvement of swarm electrification and ultimately support the integration of bottom-up initiatives with top-down grid expansion efforts over time.

AB  - Digitalization and Sustainability emerge as pivotal forces shaping contemporary society. While their convergence presents remarkable prospects, critical challenges and disconnections persist, necessitating a comprehensive exploration. This study addresses a significant gap in the literature by examining the intricate understanding and assessment of sustainable and regenerative digital transformation, currently navigated independently. Society remains unaware to the potential pitfalls associated with digitalization, often presented as a panacea for unrealistic expectations and green hypocrisy narratives. Despite the transformative potential, systematic interdisciplinary efforts in digital transformation with and for sustainability are deficient. This research advocates for a holistic conception of the enabling and systemic impacts of digital paradigms on society and the environment. Taxonomies have proven instrumental in unravelling intricate sustainability aspects, providing structured frameworks for clearer comprehension and categorization. In addressing extant caveats, our study proposes a taxonomy of key dimensions and topics defining digital transformation with sustainability and regeneration lens, to enabling the triple transition (digital, ecological, and socially just). The methodology encompasses: 1) an in-depth literature review and desk research on the convergence of digitalization and sustainability; 2) qualitative analysis supported by text mining and visualization; 3) forthcoming expert elicitation to refine and validate findings. To our best knowledge, this is the first 360-degree taxonomy covering the hallmarks of sustainable and regenerative digital transformation. The results provide a more holistic understanding of this promising nexus between digital transformation and regenerative sustainability for navigating the triple transition and opening hopeful future research and policy avenues.

Several demonstrators have been carried out to test the feasibility of implementing this new security architecture. These demonstrators need to be improved and tested on different platforms to optimize the final architecture. This new generation is based on two key paradigms: 1. The development of a new generation of low-cost, energy-efficient HSMs, enabling all smart devices to be equipped with them. 2. The establishment of a federated blockchain based on HSMs embedded in the network. Finally, the article outlines how these two paradigms can be used to implement a security technology for large networks, such as 6G, through micro-segmentation and security protocols capable of managing access to segments, all with the aim of providing high-level security at a low cost.

AB  - Significant investment is driving the essential modernization and digitization of U.S. energy infrastructure, but the United States faces a key challenge in this grid transformation: our renewable and clean energy supply chains have limited capacity to source necessary digital assets through U.S. or allied sources. Batteries and their associated power electronic interfaces are key components to delivering clean and more resilient energy delivery, providing much-needed fast ramping, emergency discharge, generation, and operations support to the electric grid. These services have grown to be invaluable over the past 10 years and will soon be an irreplaceable component of energy delivery. While there have been significant strides to move supply chains for raw and critical materials to U.S. and allied nations, the control and power electronic industry has lagged, in part because of lower cost margins. For example, the United States now has growing capacity to manufacture solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, but 90% of the inverters—which are essential to the conversion of DC to AC for grid connection and controls—are made in or source parts from the People’s Republic of China (PRC). While a global supply chain is beneficial for many economic and supply diversification reasons, presence of foreign entities of concern (FEOC) in a dominant role in this supply chain brings additional concerns for national security of infrastructure. The BESS relationship and new clean energy have features that warrant discussions and additional focus on impact for technology security, given their critical role. This review considers the impact and solutions for complex business and policy landscapes in clean energy supply chain, and the benefit trade-offs, focusing on the Battery Energy Storage System case study, and its complex organizational relationships across both the US, Allied countries and Foreign Entities of Concern. While many examples in this paper are presented on PRC focused manufacture, this could apply to any potentially adversarial relationship.

AB  - The need to ensure food security and promote environmental sustainability has led to a transformative period in agriculture. This period is characterized by the use of novel technology, which provides solutions that effectively address ecological concerns while also ensuring economic viability. Emerging technologies, such as precision farming enabled by drones, sensor-based monitoring systems and genetic editing techniques that result in drought-resistant crops, are significantly changing the agricultural sector. The integration of data analytics and machine learning algorithms is transforming supply chain management and enhancing the capabilities of predictive analytics in the context of crop diseases. Technological interventions serve to optimize efficiency and minimize the adverse ecological effects associated with farming, promoting the goals of sustainable agriculture. However, it is important to carefully address ethical and socio-economic considerations, including accessibility and data privacy, to manage these effects effectively. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the contributions of emerging technology to sustainable agriculture, evaluate its constraints, and suggest a comprehensive framework for its ethical and equitable integration. Communication technology has also impacted the agricultural sector, particularly with the increased use of connected devices. Artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements make processing collected data faster and more efficient, leading to more sustainable agricultural production using free, open-source software and sensor technology solutions.

AB  - This paper explores the interconnections among oil, artificial intelligence (AI), clean technology, and traditional markets. We apply a novel generalized quantile-on-quantile connectedness method that assesses variable cross-quantile interdependencies, analyzing data from 2018 to 2023. Our study provides a detailed examination of risk transmission dynamics between oil, AI, clean technology, and major markets including equity, debt, and currency. Our findings indicate that tail risk spillovers are more pronounced than median quantiles. In contrast, the analysis shows negative spillovers across these tails in markets for U.S. government debt, the U.S. dollar, and gold. The dynamic risk transmission analysis reveals that while the stock and AI markets generally act as net transmitters of risk across all quantiles, the crude oil and USD index markets consistently receive net risk spillovers, particularly in the right tail of the distribution. Our results suggest that, on average, AI, and clean technology markets, along with the stock markets, are more likely to transfer risk spillovers compared to debt, currency, or other commodity markets. This positions the USD and crude oil as potential buffers against extreme risk transmissions emanating from the AI and clean technology sectors. This study highlights the complex risk dynamics and the pivotal role of oil in the interplay between emerging technologies and traditional financial markets.

AB  - What stories are told in national artificial intelligence (AI) policies? Combining the novel technique of structural topic modeling (STM) and qualitative narrative analysis, this paper examines the policy narratives in 33 countries’ AI policies. We uncover six common narratives that are dominating the political agenda concerning AI. Our findings show that the policy narratives' saliences vary across time and countries. We make several contributions. First, our narratives describe well-grounded, supportable conceptions of AI among governments, and show that AI is still a fairly novel, multilayered, and controversial phenomenon. Building on the premise that human sensemaking is best represented and supported by narration, we address the applied rhetoric of governments to either minimize the risks or exalt the opportunities of AI. Second, we uncover the four prominent roles governments seek to take concerning AI implementation: enabler, leader, regulator, and/or user. Third, we make a methodological contribution toward data-driven, computationally-intensive theory development. Our methodological approach and the identified narratives present key starting points for further research.

AB  - Summary Individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds are increasingly engaging in research and development in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The main activities, although still nascent, are coalescing around three core activities: innovation, policy, and capacity building. Within agriculture, which is the focus of this paper, AI is working with converging technologies, particularly data optimization, to add value along the entire agricultural value chain, including procurement, farm automation, and market access. Our key takeaway is that, despite the promising opportunities for development, there are actual and potential challenges that African countries need to consider in deciding whether to scale up or down the application of AI in agriculture. Input from African innovators, policymakers, and academics is essential to ensure that AI solutions are aligned with African needs and priorities. This paper proposes questions that can be used to form a road map to inform research and development in this area.

AB  - Summary As the geopolitical superpowers race to regulate the digital realm, their divergent rights-centered, market-driven, and social-control-based approaches require a global compact on digital regulation. If diverse regulatory jurisdictions remain, forms of domination entailed by cultural imposition and hermeneutical injustice related to AI legislation and AI systems will follow. We argue for consensual regulation on shared substantive issues, accompanied by proper standardization and coordination. Failure to attain consensus will fragment global digital regulation, enable regulatory capture by authoritarian powers or bad corporate actors, and deepen the historical geopolitical power asymmetries between the global South and the global North. To prevent an unjust regulatory landscape where the global South’s cultural and hermeneutic resources are absent, two principles for the Global Digital Compact to counter these prospective harms are proposed and discussed: (1) “recognitive consensus on key substantive benefits and harms” and (2) “procedural consensus on global coordination and essential standards.”

AB  - In the era of big data, smart grid utilities are seeking new opportunities to create profits by making use of in-hand power big data. However, these data, such as energy consumption data, power grid measurement data, etc., are often sensitive digital assets that cannot be directly shared to third parties or individual users. To meet this gap, in this paper we propose a Privacy-Preserving energy consumption Data Sharing framework (PPDS) for smart grids. In this framework, two Paillier-based algorithms are designed respectively to achieve privacy-preserving data acquisition and secure computation of the mean for energy consumption data in a specific period or regions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed PPDS framework is efficient in privacy-preserving energy consumption data sharing.

AB  - Sadly, in the twenty-first century, approximately 55% of the people living in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to electricity. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the number of people without access to electricity in the world was 860 million by 2017, and 600 million of those people were from sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of access to electricity and shortage of electricity has negative impacts on the economy, environment, as well as the quality of healthcare and education of people in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper seeks to examine the factors that influence the profitability and affordability of smart renewable microgrid. Eliminating or reducing the barriers to profitability from an investor's perspective and consumer affordability will help to accelerate implementation to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) to ensure access to renewable, reliable, and affordable electricity to most people in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere by 2030. As a result, a significant improvement in the economic livelihoods of people in these regions.

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the current challenges related to security and trust issues in digital supply chains. The development of information and communication technologies (ICT) has improved the efficiency of supply chains, while creating new vulnerabilities and increasing the likelihood of security threats. Previous studies lack the physical security aspect, so the emphasis is on the security of cyber-physical systems. In order to achieve the goal of the study, traditional and digital supply chains, their security risks and main differences were examined. A security framework for cyber-physical risks in digital supply chains was developed.

AB  - The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda involves 17 major Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These SDGs have great implications for country-wide development and making plans in both developed and developing nations in the post-2015 period to 2030. The SDGs are a set of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a plan to attain a better sustainable future by the combination of earth observation (EO) and artificial intelligence architecture. To attain the goal of global sustainable protection and utilization of terrestrial ecosystems, it is important to quantitatively determine the implementation of Sustainable development goal 15 (SDG-15) and goal 13 (SDG-13). In this paper, we focus on the integration of these SDGs in Tunisia as a new regional development plan. Thus, we present a complete benchmark that aims to solve the complicated analytical problems related to the sophisticated data type using Deep learning (DL) architecture.

AB  - Big amount of data produced, exchanged and stored during a building's lifetime, along with the increasing adoption of IoT technologies, provide a huge potential for the development of data-driven services that can facilitate processes such as predictive maintenance or monitoring of KPIs that are required for demonstrating climate policy compliance. On the other hand, storing and sharing information among interested stakeholders, can generate critical privacy and trust issues. In this paper, we present a blueprint architecture based on a combination of state-of-the-art and disruptive technologies, introducing the concept of a modular Trusted Digital Building Logbook (DBL) that will act as a dynamic record at facility level and will segregate monitored data and other building related information, in a way that guarantees both the privacy of confidential data and the transparency to authorities and city stakeholders that wish to have a real-time overview of buildings' performance at a local or regional level. The Trusted DBL is based on Blockchain and Digital Twin (DT) technologies and can be used to report progress on emission reductions, the impact of a given energy efficiency measure or to recommend precautionary measures ahead of critical events such as heatwaves. Designed to be interoperable, the Trusted DBL architecture revolutionises the buildings performance evaluation process by securely connecting different buildings clusters to capture critical information at national, organizational and/or facility level, help understand a region's emissions profile and report it in the form of a trusted emissions inventory.

AB  - Green bonds, financial instruments designed to fund environmentally sustainable projects, are pivotal in achieving global sustainability goals. However, their adoption faces significant challenges, including limited and inconsistent impact reporting, fragmented regulatory frameworks, and restricted market accessibility for smaller investors. Tokenization, the process of converting real-world assets into digital tokens, offers a transformative solution by leveraging blockchain to improve traceability, automate compliance, and democratize access. This paper proposes a blockchain-based tokenization framework leveraging Ethereum's robust, scalable, and widely adopted ecosystem, providing transparency and smart contract capabilities essential for green bond management. The framework integrates fractional ownership via ERC-20 tokens, directly addressing the issue of limited market accessibility by enabling broader participation from smaller investors. By resolving these operational bottlenecks, the proposed model enhances trust among stakeholders, fosters inclusivity in green finance, and supports global sustainability goals, particularly advancing SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).

AB  - The convergence of Net Zero and cutting-edge digital technologies such as IoT sensors, digital twins, and blockchains represents a new frontier in advancing the digital economy. Global adoption of digital technology was further accelerated during the global pandemic, driven by new ways of working, learning, and communicating. With the increasing focus on reducing global carbon emissions, the synergy between digital technologies and Net Zero offers a significant opportunity to combat climate change. The role of networks in this transition has often been underestimated. This paper explores how future network architecture can simultaneously meet growing functional demands and become more energy-efficient, thus playing a key role in achieving Net Zero goals. We introduce a novel Sustainable Energy-Efficient Network Architecture framework, designed to support sustainability objectives by enhancing energy efficiency of networks. Our key contributions in this paper include multiple use cases supporting future energy-efficient network architecture that are (i) enhanced CDRX for extended reality, (ii) digital twin of 5G radio access network, and (iii) power profiling and prediction of a virtualised base station. The selected use cases were chosen to demonstrate the practical impact of developing energy efficient network. Moreover, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed use cases.

AB  - In the period of decentralized networks and Hadoop technology, the confluence of Blockchain and Machine Learning (ML) technologies has emerged as a promising solution for ensuring robust, transparent, and private transactions. While the individual merits of Blockchain in ensuring data integrity and ML in deriving insights are well-established, their synergistic effects particularly in the realm of privacy preservation are yet to be fully explored. This fusion has the potential to revolutionize sectors like healthcare, finance, and supply chain by offering unprecedented levels of data privacy without compromising on system performance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing models that employ machine learning techniques for privacy preservation operations within blockchain frameworks. Utilizing a set of predetermined metrics delay, throughput, energy efficiency, privacy levels, deployment cost, and scalability the paper compares these models to provide a nuanced understanding of their capabilities and limitations. Our in-depth comparison elucidates the tradeoffs involved in selecting specific blockchain-ML models for diverse applications. For instance, while some models may offer higher throughput, they could compromise on privacy levels. Conversely, models excelling in privacy preservation might incur higher energy costs or delays. This multi-faceted evaluation not only guides stakeholders to choose the most efficient model based on individual or multiple metrics but also uncovers avenues for future research. By correlating these metrics with real-world use cases in healthcare, finance, and supply chain, among others, the paper adds a layer of practical applicability.

In this context, the supply chain has also quickly evolved toward the digital supply chain where digital and electronic technologies have been integrated into every aspect of its end-to-end process. This evolution provides numerous benefits such as profit maximization, loss reduction, and the optimization of supply chain lead times. However, the use of such technologies has also considerably opened up various security threats and risks which have widened the attack surface on the entire end-to-end supply chain. We present a holistic survey on supply chain security. We discuss the different security issues and attacks that target the different supply chain technologies. Then, we discuss various countermeasures and security solutions proposed by academic and industry researchers to mitigate the identified threats. Finally, we provide some recommendations and best practices that can be adopted to achieve a secure supply chain.

AB  - Social media has become a critical tool for journalists to disseminate their work, engage with their audience, and connect with sources. Unfortunately, journalists also regularly endure significant online harassment on social media platforms, ranging from personal attacks to doxxing to threats of physical harm. In this paper, we seek to understand how to make social media usable for journalists who face constant digital harassment. To begin, we conduct a set of need-finding interviews with Asian American and Pacific Islander journalists to understand where existing platform tools and newsroom resources fall short in adequately protecting journalists, especially those of marginalized identities. We map journalists' unmet needs to concrete design goals, which we use to build PressProtect, an interface that provides journalists greater agency when engaging with readers on Twitter/X. Through user testing with eight journalists, we evaluate PressProtect and find that participants felt it effectively protected them against harassment and could also generalize to serve other visible and vulnerable groups. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and recommendations for social platforms hoping to build defensive defaults for journalists facing online harassment.

AB  - Many countries around the world are planning to reach 100% renewable energy use by 2050. In this context and due to the recent sharp increase in RE utilization in the global energy mix along with its progressive impact on the world energy sector, the evaluation and investigation of its effect on achieving sustainable development goals are not covered sufficiently. Moreover, an assessment of the emerging role of artificial intelligence for renewable energy utilization toward achieving SDGs is conducted. A total of 17 SDGs were divided into three groups, namely, environment, society, and economy, as per the three key pillars of sustainable development. Renewable energy has a positive impact toward achieving 75 targets across all sustainable development goals by using an expert elicitation method-based consensus. However, it may negatively affect the accomplishment of the 27 targets. In addition, artificial intelligence can help renewable energy enable the attainment of 42 out of 169 targets. However, with the current exponential growth of renewable energy share and artificial intelligence development and addressing certain present limitations, this impact may cover additional targets in the future. Nevertheless, recent research foci overlook essential aspects. The exponential growth of renewable energy share and rapid evolution of artificial intelligence need to be accompanied through the requisite regulatory insight and technology regulation to cover additional targets in the future.

AB  - Sustainable HCI (SHCI) constitutes a relatively new research field within HCI. We have identified four literature reviews of the field conducted between 2009-2014. In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed conference and journal articles that have been published in the field during the last ten years (2010-2019). To this end, we apply the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework to classify and discern high-level goals SHCI researchers have worked towards during this period. This paper contributes to HCI by 1) identifying Sustainable Development Goals that SHCI researchers have worked towards, 2) discerning main research trends in the field during the last decade, 3) using the SDG framework generatively to enumerate and reflect on areas that this far have not been covered by SHCI research and 4) presenting takeaways and opportunities for further research by the larger HCI community.

AB  - Scenario planning is a powerful tool for cities to navigate uncertainties and mitigate the impacts of adverse scenarios by projecting future outcomes based on present-day decisions. This approach is becoming increasingly important given the growing call for building resilient cities to face adverse future scenarios posed by emerging disruptive technologies and climate change. However, conventional scenario planning practices predominantly rely on expert knowledge and judgment, which may be limited in accounting for the complexity of future scenarios. Therefore, we explored the potential integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scenario planning practices. We synthesized related studies from various disciplines (e.g., engineering, computer science, and urban planning) to identify the potential applications of AI in the three key components of scenario planning: plan generation, scenario generation, and plan evaluation. We then discuss the challenges and possible solutions for integrating AI into the scenario planning process and highlight the critical role of planning experts in this process. We conclude by outlining future research opportunities in this context. Ultimately, this study contributes to the advancement of scenario planning practices and aids the creation of more resilient cities that can thrive in an uncertain future.

AB  - Digital technologies (DTs) play a crucial role in advancing the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It provides innovative solutions to global challenges like poverty alleviation, equitable healthcare, climate action, and responsible consumption. This study is motivated by the growing significance of DTs in addressing sustainability challenges and their critical contribution to achieving the SDGs while identifying barriers to their adoption. Using a systematic review, this review examines the contributions of various DTs, i.e., AI, IoT, blockchain, cloud computing, big data analytics, remote sensing, and GIS in addressing SDGs. The review methodology includes the keywords search in the title, abstract, and keywords “Digital Technologies” and “Sustainable Development” on the Scopus database. A total of 473 peer-reviewed articles are included in the study. The findings highlight the transformative role of DTs in enhancing resource optimization, decision-making, and service delivery and achieving various SDGs. AI facilitates automation and predictive analytics, supporting healthcare (SDG 3) and climate action (SDG 13). Blockchain enhances transparency, security, and ethical governance (SDG 16). IoT enables real-time monitoring for smart cities (SDG 11) and energy efficiency (SDG 7). Big data analytics strengthens supply chains, agricultural productivity (SDG 2), and disaster management (SDG 13). Cloud computing fosters collaboration and scalability (SDG 9, SDG 17), while 5G networks improve connectivity and infrastructure development. Remote sensing and GIS provide essential insights for environmental monitoring (SDG 14, SDG 15) and disaster response. Despite these benefits, several challenges hinder DT adoption, including the digital divide, high costs, data privacy concerns, and skill shortages. To overcome these barriers, the study emphasizes policy measures such as (i) increased government investments in digital infrastructure, (ii) strategic public–private partnerships, and (iii) capacity-building initiatives for organizations, communities, and individuals. Ensuring equitable access, ethical digital practices, and environmental sustainability is crucial to fully leveraging DTs for SDGs achievement. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers, industry leaders, businesses, organizations, researchers, communities, and individuals for leveraging and developing inclusive sustainable digital transformation strategies that accelerate progress toward the SDGs.

AB  - In recent years, the rapid increase in the global population, the challenges associated with climate change, and the emergence of new pandemics have all become major threats to food security worldwide. Consequently, innovative solutions are urgently needed to address the current challenges and enhance food sustainability. Green technologies have gained significant attention for many food applications, while the technologies of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) are reshaping different production and consumption sectors, such as food and agriculture. In this review, a general overview of green and Industry 4.0 technologies from a food perspective will be provided. Connections between green food technologies (e.g., green preservation, processing, extraction, and analysis) and Industry 4.0 enablers (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and the Internet of Things) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be identified and explained. Green and Industry 4.0 technologies are both rapidly becoming a valuable part of meeting the SDGs. These technologies demonstrate high potential to foster ecological and digital transitions of food systems, delivering societal, economic, and environmental outcomes. A range of green technologies has already provided innovative solutions for major food system transformations, while the application of digital technologies and other Industry 4.0 technological innovations is still limited in the food sector. It is therefore expected that more green and digital solutions will be adopted in the coming years, harnessing their full potential to achieve a healthier, smarter, more sustainable and more resilient food future.

AB  - The energy consumption of data centers has become an increasing concern in the whole world. Actually, the cooling system consumes the most energy among the auxiliary facilities. An integrated heat pipe cooling system has been proposed to reduce the energy consumption of cooling system by using natural cooling sources in our previous work. However, it still has huge energy-saving potential in the operating process. In this paper, the heat transfer model and energy consumption model of the integrated heat pipe cooling system was established to describe the relationship between operating parameters and energy efficiency. Based on genetic algorithm, energy efficiency optimization operation strategy was calculated at different load rates and outdoor ambient temperature. An experiment was carried out to verify the accuracy of the optimization algorithm. Compared with the previous work, the energy efficiency ratio of the integrated heat pipe cooling system can be improved by 2–3 times in natural cooling model and integrated cooling mode after energy efficiency optimization. The switching rules of the system’s operating mode was studied, and analyzed the energy-saving effects of application in different climate cities.

AB  - Data center, as a special building form, has attracted much attention because of its increasing energy consumption. In order to reduce the energy consumption of data center caused by cooling system, research on the water-cooled heat sinks used to cool chips has become increasingly important with the steep increase in the heat flux density of data centers. To explore the effect of different water-cooled heat sinks on cooling system performance, a server water-cooled system for the server cabinet was built, and the chip heat dissipation performance, optimal thermal management, and system energy consumption were simulated by equipping a cooling tower and two types of fin-type water-cooled heat sinks (A-type and B-type). By comparing the effects of A- and B-type heat sinks on the server water-cooled system performance, the optimal water working condition was obtained under different atmospheric conditions by minimizing the system power consumption to guarantee that the chip temperature is no higher than 70 °C. It was found that the optimal cooling water flow rate fluctuates in a large range under different atmospheric conditions. A server water-cooled system equipped with B-type can achieve significant energy savings compared to those from A-type system when the atmospheric relative humidity and temperature are high. Considering a case study from Tianjin, China, it is shown that the month-averaged power usage effectiveness in June is 1.2 for A-type and 1.14 for B-type systems.

AB  - The substantial stock of European buildings, accounting for more than 40% of energy consumption, has prompted member states to establish a renovation standard with stringent performance criteria. As advancing into the era of digital transformation, the concept of smart buildings emerges as a solution to create sustainable, efficient, resilient, active, and comfortable living and working spaces. This is achieved through intelligent resource use optimization, including the smart management of energy production, storage and distribution systems. Smart buildings operate by harnessing monitoring data and leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms and big data techniques. The integration of monitoring data with contextual information, such as building information modelling, physics, or simulation models, enhances the intelligent management of resources. Moreover, the incorporation of metrics like the smart readiness indicator promotes the adoption of smart buildings. This study delves into the significance of these techniques, expanding on existing research in the field of smart buildings. It integrates concepts of data enrichment, smartness, and user-centric approaches. Key findings provide insights into future opportunities within the sector, emphasizing the need for user awareness strategies, the development of new smart algorithms, and services that incorporate contextual data and the smart readiness indicator. The study also advocates for the widespread adoption of building digital twins.

AB  - Owing to the dramatic increase in IT power density and energy consumption, the data center (DC) sector has started adopting thermally- and energy-efficient liquid cooling methods. This study examines a single-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling approach for three high-heat-density racks, utilizing two liquid-to-air (L2A) cooled coolant distribution units (CDUs) and a combined total heat load of 128 kW. An experimental setup was developed to test different types of CDUs, cooling loops, and thermal testing vehicles (TTVs) for different operating conditions. IR images and the collected data were used to investigate the effect of air recirculation between cold and hot aisle containments on the CDU’s performance and stability of supply air temperature (SAT). Three different types of cooling loops (X, Y, and Z) were characterized thermally and hydraulically. Results show that Type Y has the lowest cold plate thermal resistance and pressure drop, among others. In a later test that included a single rack at a heat load of 53 kW and a single CDU, the heat capture ratio for fluid was found to be 94%. Experiments show that using blanking panels on the back of the racks limits hot air recirculation and maintains a steady SAT in the cold aisle. Finally, the CDU performance was evaluated at a high heat load for the three racks at 128 kW, and the average cooling capacity of the units is 58.6 kW, and the effectiveness values for CDU 1 and CDU 2 are 0.83 and 0.82, respectively.

AB  - Enormous amounts of data are being produced everyday by sub-meters and smart sensors installed in residential buildings. If leveraged properly, that data could assist end-users, energy producers and utility companies in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem becoming overwhelming. Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable and energy efficient behavior. In this regard, this paper is an in-depth review of existing anomaly detection frameworks for building energy consumption based on artificial intelligence. Specifically, an extensive survey is presented, in which a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced to classify existing algorithms based on different modules and parameters adopted, such as machine learning algorithms, feature extraction approaches, anomaly detection levels, computing platforms and application scenarios. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review article that discusses anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous power consumption, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions, (iv) platforms for reproducibility and (v) privacy-preservation. Following, insights about current research trends are discussed to widen the applications and effectiveness of the anomaly detection technology before deriving future directions attracting significant attention. This article serves as a comprehensive reference to understand the current technological progress in anomaly detection of energy consumption based on artificial intelligence.

AB  - The transition to sustainable energy for all is a crucial aspect of the sustainable development goals, particularly Goal 7, which underscores the need for clean and affordable energy. This requires the development of digital infrastructure and a strong financial system. As a result, this study contributes to knowledge by exploring the synergies and nonlinear effects of the digital economy and financial development on renewable energy, which remains underexplored. To this effect, this study recruits the dynamic panel threshold and the generalised method of moments estimations to evaluate the linear, synergies and nonlinearities among these factors using a panel of forty-seven African countries. The key empirical results are stated as follows: (1) renewable energy is positively impacted by the digital economy; (2) the impact of the digital economy on renewable energy is moderated by financial development. This suggests that to ensure the propelling effect of the digital economy on renewable energy, there is a need for a stable and robust financial system; and (3) the study further found nonlinear effects of the digital economy and financial development on renewable energy, which takes a U-shaped relationship, implying that low level of digitalisation and financial development may hinder the transition to renewable energy, while high levels of these factors are essential to expedite the transition to a more sustainable energy system. Hence, African countries must embrace digitalisation and commit significant financial resources to developing their digital infrastructure to facilitate the achievement of the net zero agenda.

A theoretical framework synthesizing the Technology - Organization - Environment framework and the Technology Readiness Index was developed to guide this qualitative study. Seventeen senior managerial representatives from exhibition organizations across nine Western European countries were interviewed, and a reflexive thematic approach was adopted to analyse the data. The findings suggest that the European exhibition industry is a slow adopter of AI, which may impact its future competitiveness, despite the stimulus provided to AI adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic. The degree of confidence in organizational technological practices, financial resources, the size of the organization, and issues of data management and protection, as well as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, motivate or inhibit readiness for AI adoption in the event industry. A new Exhibition Sector Readiness for AI Adoption Model is presented in this research that managers and researchers can use to analyze inhibitors and motivations for AI adoption, which is contextualized for the current challenges facing the exhibitions sector.

AB  - Governments’ net zero emission target aims at increasing the share of renewable energy sources as well as influencing the behaviours of consumers to support the cost-effective balancing of energy supply and demand. These will be achieved by the advanced information and control infrastructures of smart grids which allow the interoperability among various stakeholders. Under this circumstance, increasing number of consumers produce, store, and consume energy, giving them a new role of prosumers. The integration of prosumers and accommodation of incurred bidirectional flows of energy and information rely on two key factors: flexible structures of energy markets and intelligent operations of power systems. The blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) are innovative technologies to fulfil these two factors, by which the blockchain provides decentralised trading platforms for energy markets and the AI supports the optimal operational control of power systems. This paper attempts to address how to incorporate the blockchain and AI in the smart grids for facilitating prosumers to participate in energy markets. To achieve this objective, first, this paper reviews how policy designs price carbon emissions caused by the fossil-fuel based generation so as to facilitate the integration of prosumers with renewable energy sources. Second, the potential structures of energy markets with the support of the blockchain technologies are discussed. Last, how to apply the AI for enhancing the state monitoring and decision making during the operations of power systems is introduced.

AB  - Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.

AB  - The cloud computing platform has become a favorable destination for running cloud workflow applications. However, they are primarily complicated and require intensive computing. Task scheduling in cloud environments, when formulated as an optimization problem, is proven to be NP-hard. Thus, efficient task scheduling plays a decisive role in minimizing energy costs. Electricity prices fluctuate depending on the vending company, time, and location. Therefore, optimizing energy costs has become a serious issue that one must consider when building workflow applications scheduling across geographically distributed cloud data centers (GD-CDCs). To tackle this issue, we have suggested a dual optimization approach called electricity price and energy-efficient (EPEE) workflow scheduling algorithm that simultaneously considers energy efficiency and fluctuating electricity prices across GD-CDCs, aims to reach the minimum electricity costs of workflow applications under the deadline constraints. This novel integration of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) with energy and electricity price optimization is unique compared to existing methods. Moreover, our EPEE approach, which includes task prioritization, deadline partitioning, data center selection based on energy efficiency and price diversity, and dynamic task scheduling, provides a comprehensive solution that significantly reduces electricity costs and enhances resource utilization. In addition, the inclusion of both generated and original data transmission times further differentiates our approach, offering a more realistic and practical solution for cloud service providers (CSPs). The experimental results reveal that the EPEE model produces better success rates to meet task deadlines, maximize resource utilization, cost and energy efficiencies in comparison to adapted state-of-the-art algorithms for similar problems.

AB  - The e-waste collected by its user is one of the significant developments that can help to reduce the uncontrolled e-waste collection. In order to raise consumer awareness on E-waste management, it must be planned well to balance the growth of e-waste collected, and the cost invested. A good strategy is needed, with the Ministry of Environmental and Forestry as a part of the Government to engage and increase the awareness of electronic users with the help of e-waste management organizations that aware of e-waste problems. The complexity of the e-waste management system added challenges to address the problems. This paper aims to explore policy alternatives that could influence consumer awareness in e-waste management in Indonesia. This conceptual model will draw the policy structure exploration with the system dynamics modeling approach to give an understanding of the relations and dynamics between the factors in the e-waste management system in Indonesia.

AB  - This paper examines the technical aspects of utilizing Internet of Energy (IoE) metadata in smart city environments. Through comparative and inductive analysis of existing literature and technical reports, we explore how advanced metadata management techniques can address inefficiencies in processing and analyzing large volumes of energy data in urban systems. Key findings include the potential for standardized metadata ontologies, edge computing for data preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition in energy consumption. We propose strategies for developing unified IoE metadata management systems that integrate with broader smart city infrastructure. While metadata-driven approaches show promise for enhancing energy efficiency and sustainability in urban environments, challenges in data privacy and security remain. This research highlights IoE metadata as a critical tool for optimizing energy systems in smart cities through advanced data analytics and management techniques.

AB  - At the heart of the concept of sustainable development is the concern that human interactions with the environment are becoming, or have already become, impossible to maintain in the long run. Eventually, these interactions could lead to an inability of the global biosphere to provide essential amenities and services for further human development. Thus, sustainable development is first a concern about environmental degradation, at least as understood by most observers in the industrial world. We adopt the Brundtland Report definition of sustainable development, and also recognize that in this terminology, development clearly represents more than material consumption and economic growth. It includes, among other things, education, cultural and social activity, health, justice, peace, and security. One of the critical elements of sustainable development lies in understanding the role that technological innovation plays in this process. Recognizing that technology is a critical ingredient in the sustainable development recipe, we devise an operational knowledge based tool that can help determine which technologies are best suited to the needs of a sustainable society. Our purpose is to present and explore this decision support tool in order to assist researchers and technology policy makers in structuring and making decisions in light of sustainable development goals.

AB  - Canada requires a next generation forest measuring and monitoring system that responds to key policy drivers related to climate change and to report upon sustainable forest development of Canada's forest both nationally and internationally. The Canadian Forest Service, in partnership with the Canadian Space Agency, is using space-based Earth observation (EO) technologies to create products for forest inventory, forest carbon accounting, monitoring sustainable development, and landscape management. The Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) initiative will work in partnership with the Provinces and Territories and develop a land cover map of the forested area of Canada. Research programs are also a component of EOSD to develop techniques for change monitoring, biomass estimates and automated processing to aid in production. Inputs from EOSD will be an important data source in the National Forest Carbon Accounting Framework and will also be used to enhance Canada's new plot-based National Forest Inventory. Initially EOSD, working with the provinces, territories, universities and industry, will work to develop a national map of the forested land cover of Canada with the long term goal of producing not only land cover maps, but maps of forest change over time, and biomass. The National Forest Information System will be used to integrate and synthesize applicable data and products and make them accessible to a wide range of users through the web.

AB  - Since China's reform and opening, with the rapid development of the heavy manufacturing and high energy consumption industry, energy consumption also increases significantly. However, in the energy consumption process, out-dated technology lead to high energy consumption of the unit GDP and the environmental pollution, which have directly influenced the sustainable development of China's energy consumption, economy and society. In order to ensure China's energy consumption, economic and social sustainable development, we should put more technology into the energy consumption to realize the changes towards tech-intensive China's energy consumption and the goal of China's 11th Five-Year Plan that average energy consumption per unit GDP decline 20%. Therefore, on the basis of analyzing the actuality of China's energy consumption per unit GDP and technology advance, first the paper sums up 14 indexes which impact China's technology advance and sets up a comprehensive assessment system on China's technology advance; second it uses gray correlation analysis to select the key technology indexes which have an important impact on China's energy consumption constitution, and builds a multiple linear regression model for analyzing the connection between technology advance and China's energy consumption; Finally it uses GM (1.1) gray prediction model to select the optimum technology inputs decision-making which can realize the goal of China's 11th Five-Year Plan that average energy consumption per unit GDP decline 20%, in order to provide theoretical support for the relevant departments.

AB  - In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly accepted the 2030 Development Agenda, which has included 92 paragraphs, and the Paragraph 91 defined 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 associated targets. The goal of this paper is to discover the correlations among SDGs and information and communications technologies (ICTs). This paper discusses the roles and opportunities that ICTs play in pursuing the SDGs. We identify a number of research gaps to those three pillars, social, economic, and environmental perspectives, of sustainable development. After extensive literature reviews on the SDG-related research initiatives and activities, we find that the majority of contributions to SDGs recognized by the IEEE and ACM research communities have mainly focused on the technical aspects while there are lack of the holistic social good perspectives. Therefore, there are essential and urgent needs to raise the awareness and call for attentions on how to innovate and energize ICTs in order to best assist all nations to achieve the SDGs by 2030.

AB  - Sustainable development requirements are often regarded as adding a layer of cost to production of goods and delivery of services. This perception can result in the dilution of sustainable development goals. To address this concern, it is necessary to improve both the methods by which sustainable development is achieved and the validation of its long-term benefits. Identification of better and more quantifiable indicators of value and progress are clearly linked to achieving sustainable development. This article explores the way that International Standards can help government agencies and development organizations to make sense of information communication technology and the way they can be used to improve and report outcomes. Standards can help ensure that innovations and processes are interoperable, reliable and secure. Blockchain standards will improve blockchain's reputation as a useful layer of technology for tracking and auditing data, exchanges and transactions, making it an invaluable tool for achieving transparency and trust in sustainable development programs.

AB  - The sustainable development goals were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 to propel the efforts of countries all over the world towards a more sustainable future. One can agree that although technology cannot solve all our problems, it can create many paths towards solutions and is perhaps one of the most powerful tools towards prosperity. Smart grid development, with its correspondence with the electrical grid development is of particular interest since electricity is a precursor to both innovation and progress. In this study, the contribution of smart grids towards the aforementioned sustainable development goals has been analyzed for both developed and developing countries. These contributions have been identified as either short-term contributions or long-term contributions, with long term contributions being predominant in developing countries due to limitations associated with the existing infrastructure. Following this, a number of central concepts where smart grids could contribute to several goals are identified and discussed.

AB  - The framework for Education 4.0 highlights the need for new assessment models of digital competencies to be incorporated into the curricula of Higher Education Institutions. Additionally, including new artificial intelligence tools (AI) can significantly help assess student skills development more flexibly and effectively. This study versatilely implemented natural language processing (NLP) tools to strengthen the active learning approach to developing adequate educational solutions. The NLP tools proved ideal for evaluating soft skills in engineering. The study sample comprised 286 students enrolled in sustainability and energy efficiency subjects during six consecutive semesters from 2019 to 2021. The study's mixed methodology used a four-group Solomon-type design with two types of validated instruments used as pre-Tests and post-Tests: a) qualitative (surveys, questionnaires, interviews, and rubrics) and b) quantitative (tools for statistical data management). The study results confirmed that NLP tools are helpful to reduce teachers' training biases in the evaluations of students' digital literacy skills. In addition, the results showed that NLP tools can complement the evidence that instructors share with students in review and feedback sessions and improve their perception of the validity and reliability of the assessment instruments.

AB  - The goal is to explore the prediction performance of energy consumption in digital twins of the intelligent factory in the process of urbanization, so that it can provide good guidance for the green development of cities. The digital twin technology is introduced into the intelligent factory, in view of the influence of life cycle, data transmission delay and other factors of the equipment on product energy consumption of intelligent factory manufacturing in the real physical environment. Meanwhile, it is improved by DL (deep learning) algorithm to construct an improved AlexNet algorithm framework. Then, DPFS (Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph) algorithm is adopted to build a digital twin energy consumption prediction model of intelligent factory based on DL and privacy algorithm. Finally, a simulation scenario is established to verify its performance. Through the comparative analysis of the digital twin energy consumption prediction model and other scholars’ models in related fields, the feature recognition accuracy of the constructed model reaches 89.23%, at least 1.95% higher than that of other neural network models. From the perspective of energy consumption data transmission performance, the data message delivery rate of the proposed model is not less than 80%. Besides, the data message leakage rate and packet loss rate are less than 11%, and the average delay is basically stable. Therefore, the constructed model can achieve high energy consumption data transmission security performance under the premise of ensuring the prediction accuracy, which can provide experimental basis for the prediction of energy consumption and the improvement of security maintenance performance in intelligent factories.

The fulfilment requires many different types of multidisciplinary actions, including technology development. In order to teach the goals based on smart grids, two alternative assignments were created. Each student focused either on the targets of a specific goal or on a smart grid related trend. The student then wrote a 2 to 3-page essay on the matter, covering both the developed and the developing country perspectives. The work was precedented by an introductory lecture on the development goals and contained lectures on smart grids as well as student led seminars. Both assignments were appreciated by the students. Some students stated that the assignments did not only contribute to the learning on the sustainable development goals but also on smart grids itself, which was a positive spin-off effect.

AB  - Addressing the challenges posed by climate change has led to a global consensus on adopting various environmentally sustainable practices, especially those aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Simultaneously, the role of digital innovation (DI) is increasingly recognized as a potential driver for corporate sustainability transformation in the current wave of the digital era. To investigate the environmental benefits of DI, this study examines the impact of corporate DI on carbon emission intensity (CE) through the lens of dynamic capability view. Based on the sample of manufacturing companies listed in Chinese Stock “A” market over the period 2010–2020, the empirical results show that corporate DI and CE are negatively correlated. Furthermore, corporate governance and managerial ability significantly enhance these relationships. The framework presented provides new perspectives and evidence that DI drives firms’ carbon reduction targets.

AB  - As the world faces challenges like resource depletion and environmental degradation, the concept of a circular economy is gaining attention. Central to this concept is the ability to track and manage the life cycle of products, which is where the Digital Product Passport (DPP) becomes crucial. A DPP provides a comprehensive record of a product's entire life cycle, from raw material sourcing to disposal or recycling, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability across the supply chain. This paper proposes using blockchain technology, specifically Hyperledger Fabric, to implement DPPs. The proposed system uses separate channels to manage different stages of a product's life cycle, thereby enhancing data security and stakeholder collaboration. Additionally, the implementation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) is recommended to facilitate data integration and ensure unified access across channels. This approach allows each stakeholder to access only the necessary information, preventing unnecessary data exposure. The use of DIDs also facilitates data integration across multiple channels and provides a unified data query function, enabling consistent tracking of data throughout the entire life cycle of a product.

AB  - As more and more computing technologies become pervasive in our daily lives, more and more e-waste is generated. And yet, when designing the next generation of devices, we prioritize qualities such as speed, usability, and usefulness (a.k.a. user-centered design), rarely exploring options that might not optimize for users but, instead, improve long-term environmental sustainability. Exploring these alternatives is essential for transitioning toward a more sustainable future in computing. To this end, we argue that the envisioned roles we attribute to users during user-centered design should encompass much more. In addition to the role of the “user of a device,” we can design for user roles such as maintainers, repairers, and recyclers of interactive devices. We discuss this design shift through examples of two interactive systems we built to explore altering the role of the traditional “user” to that of caretaker and recycler. Finally, we discuss more roles that designs might explore for their users and how these roles can encourage users to take on responsibilities to support more sustainable futures for pervasive technology.

AB  - Current trend projected the global population to increase to 9 billion by the year 2050 which will increase the demand of food production by around 70%. The agricultural sector also supplies produce to bio-based products such as bioenergy and bioplastics which is also increasing the demand for crops. However, the situation is not as simple as planting more crops, as current agricultural practices are not sustainable. Environmental impact and climate changes could be reduced with the utilization of indoor farming could bring about a more sustainable farming solution. Combined with the utilization of precision farming solutions such as IoT based sensors and robotic systems indoor farming could become the next step in sustainable farming. The implementation of precision farming in indoor farming comes with its problems which may cause a challenge in the development and deployment period. This paper serves as the preliminary research for the development of a robotic system to be deployed at Sarawak’s Digital Economy Corporation (SDEC)’s greenhouse.

AB  - As the International Energy Agency expects forecasts Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) economies to convert contamination pivots in the near future, restructuring optimal abatement path for decarbonization has become imperatively vital for the concerned administrations. To this end, the main objective of this study is to recognize the indicators that can assist BRICS economies in monitoring their atmospheric toxic expulsions. In this regard, this study estimates the role of natural resources, human capital, renewable energy use and technological innovations on environmental pollution in BRICS economies from 1990 to 2020. After verifying the possible cross-sectional dependency, this study applied a battery of second-generation panel data approaches to estimate the reliable, consistent, robust and unbiased outcomes. Estimated outcomes reveal that natural resources rent is the only indicator which degrade the environmental quality. However, technological innovations, human capital, and renewable energy significantly protect the environmental eminence in the BRICS region. Additionally, panel Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality analysis establishes a unidirectional from technological innovations and from renewable energy to ecological footprint. Conversely, it is found a bidirectional causality link exists between human capital and ecological footprint, and finally, between renewable energy and human capital. Based on these estimated findings, numerous decarbonization policies are suggested for BRICS economies.

AB  - The manufacturing sector, a major contributor to global carbon emissions, is under growing pressure to adopt sustainable practices. Despite its potential, green hydrogen as a clean energy solution faces significant challenges, including limited technological feasibility, high costs, insufficient regulatory support, inadequate infrastructure, low market demand, and lack of awareness. This study addresses these barriers by proposing a novel framework that integrates green hydrogen acceptance and green digital technologies to kickstart manufacturing SMEs' “Go Green” journey and enhance low carbon emission performance. The research investigates critical factors influencing green hydrogen acceptance—such as technological feasibility, economic viability, regulatory support, infrastructure development, market demand, and awareness—and evaluates the mediating role of green digital technologies in reducing emissions. Data were collected from 343 owners and managers of manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia and analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) with AMOS 24.0 software. Findings reveal that the proposed framework significantly enhances low carbon emission performance, with green digital technologies playing a partial mediating role. This framework provides practical insights for SMEs to adopt sustainable energy solutions and digital innovations, fostering a supportive ecosystem for sustainability. Its real-world application empowers SMEs to reduce carbon footprints, meet regulatory goals, and gain a competitive edge in the green economy.

AB  - Energy is essential for human existence, and its high consumption is a growing concern in today's technology-driven society. Global initiatives aim to reduce energy consumption and pollution by developing and deploying energy-efficient sensing technologies for long-term monitoring, control, automation, security, and interactions. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) benefit a lot from the continuous monitoring capabilities of these sensing devices, which include medical sensors worn on or implanted in the human body for healthcare monitoring. Despite significant advancements, achieving energy efficiency in WBANs remains a significant challenge. A deep understanding of the WBAN architecture is essential to identify the causes of its energy inefficiency and develop novel energy-efficient solutions. We investigate energy efficiency issues specific to WBANs. We discuss the transformative impact that artificial intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) can have on achieving the energy efficiency of WBANs. Additionally, we explore the potential of emerging technologies such as quantum computing, nano-technology, biocompatible energy harvesting, and Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) in enabling energy efficiency in WBANs. We focus on WBANs' architecture, hardware, and software components to identify key factors responsible for energy consumption in the WBAN environment. Based on our comprehensive review, we introduce an innovative, energy-efficient three-tier architecture for WBANs that employs ML and edge computing to overcome the limitations inherent in existing energy-efficient solutions. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned and highlight future research directions that will enable the development of energy-efficient solutions for WBANs.

AB  - Industry 4.0 technologies are also strengthening the circular economy and circular healthcare. It is accomplished by implementing methods to reduce waste and undertake advanced sustainability initiatives. Industry 4.0 uses advanced technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud computing, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance productivity, satisfy customers, and generate new business opportunities. Industry 4.0 may immediately redirect a system, equipment, or worker who deviates from the most effective path to reduce wasteful emissions. Due to the limited supply of resources and increasing demand to discover sustainable manufacturing methods, the conventional strategy has proven unsuccessful. In order to reduce the need and demand for resources, the circular economy is in which waste from one sector is repurposed as raw material in another. Industry 4.0 brought forth technological advancements that are fundamentally more sustainable than conventional corporate methods. A sustainable strategy that lowers waste production and limits exposure to dangerous chemicals in the healthcare industry is known as circular healthcare. The reuse, repair, and recycling of toxic-free materials and products are encouraged in circular healthcare. The healthcare industry has to stop utilizing dangerous chemicals, stop using single-use items that are troublesome and wasteful, and take the lead in developing sustainable supply chains. Industry 4.0 developments assist the circular economy and healthcare by lowering material waste. Reuse opportunities are increased, appropriateness is improved, and negative mining consequences are minimized when pollution levels are low. In this paper, we have adopted a review-based approach to accomplish research objectives. This paper discusses Industry 4.0 and its relationship with the circular economy and healthcare. Studies specific practices of Circular Economy philosophy and discusses the Smart enablers of Industry 4.0 for Circular Economy. Finally, it identifies and discusses the role of Industry 4.0 in the smart circular economy and circular healthcare. Machines in Industry 4.0 with human-machine interfaces record data using cyber-physical systems and then analyze historical behaviour using Machine Learning (ML). The main aim of circular healthcare is to improve global health and sustainability while taking social and environmental responsibility. Creating a product that is useful for as and, integrates well with the environment, and can be recycled. By utilizing the circular economy and circular healthcare, healthcare organizations may gain and contribute to sustainable business models that help them for better health outcomes, enhanced patient and worker experiences, and lower care costs.

AB  - Alongside advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), significant progress has been made in big data processing, edge/cloud computing, and ubiquitous computing in the past two decades. These advancements catalyzed the development and adoption of Digital Twins (DT) across various domains, serving as virtual replicas of Physical Objects (POs). DTs provide advanced visualization and simulation capabilities, enabling effective estimation, optimization, and forecasting of PO's behaviors. However, the widespread adoption of DTs has introduced various security threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks. Despite ongoing research in DT applications and security, there is a lack of systematic review of the DT security literature across domains and architectural layers. This study fills this gap by systematically reviewing DT research, focusing on three interrelated aspects: DT applications, architectural layers, and security. We explore DT's architectural layers, functional requirements, application, and creation software to identify potential threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities specific to DT layers and application domains. We then systematize our findings under a unified security framework and pinpoint countermeasures against identified security challenges. Furthermore, our study explores DT's role in mitigating existing cyber threats, and we conclude our work by identifying open challenges and potential research directions.

AB  - With developing on cloud computing, data center networks have received great attention recently. In order to support high availability and bandwidth, data center networks are usually designed based on peak traffic. Unfortunately, peak traffic does not happen all the time. This causes unnecessary energy wastage and leads to low network utilization. We aim to minimize the power usage of data center networks by consolidating traffic flows and turning off unnecessary network devices. To support high availability, a requirement of two node-disjoint paths between the source and destination of each traffic flow is considered. We formulate the problem in mathematical format by integer linear programming (ILP). Due to its high computational complexity, we further propose a heuristic approach for practical use. The experimental results show that the heuristic approach reduces the power consumption by 15 to 35% in average while improving the availability by about 15% with significant improvement on computation time.

AB  - To ensure the intelligent development and online development of supply chain finance (SCF) business, this study deeply explores the application of intelligent robots in the development of financial intelligence from the perspective of supply chain finance. This study reviews the intelligent robot operating system based on SCF management and analyzes in detail the impact of digital inclusive finance on the innovation mechanism of green financial enterprises. Causal inference methods are introduced to construct one or more “synthetic control” units. These units are weighted averages of multiple control units, aiming to simulate the pre-policy implementation state of the treated unit as closely as possible, thus more accurately estimating policy effects. In the empirical analysis, based on detailed financial data of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from 2015 to 2022, the relationship between the digital inclusive finance index and corporate green innovation is explored. In the analysis of control variables, enterprises' return on assets (ROA), auditors from the Big Four accounting firms (Big4), Book-to-Market (BM), enterprise size, and institutional investor shareholding ratio all show a positive correlation with green innovation of enterprises. Specifically, regarding the state of development of digital inclusive finance, the average of the Index is 0.213, with the median slightly higher than this value. This reveals that the development level of digital inclusive finance in the cities where most enterprises are located exceeds this average level. Regarding controlling the data results of variables, the enterprise size's mean value is stable at 21.989. The mean values of ROA, Big4, Research and Development (R&D), and BM are 0.044, 0.027, 0.025, and 0.783, respectively. In addition, digital inclusive finance positively impacts corporate green innovation. In small enterprises and the central and western regions, digital inclusive finance has a greater impact on green innovation. Therefore, the intelligent robot operating system has a wide range of application prospects in the digital SCF environment, which can improve the level of enterprise financial intelligence and promote the innovation activities of green financial enterprises.

AB  - Metaverses may present innovative channels for business and finance, education, and workplaces. Drawing from the Diffusion of Innovation Theory and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as well as the literature on digital equality, this research attempts to unravel the dynamics of digital equality and trust in AI-empowered metaverses for various industry sectors. Three cross-sectional surveys (NTotal = 1086) examined US Internet users' intention to adopt metaverses for business, education, and workplaces. Structural equation models were estimated using Mplus 8.8. Study 1 indicates dynamic relationships among digital equality (commerce dimension), blockchain transparency, privacy concerns, and adoption intention. Study 2 shows dynamic associations among digital equality (educational, social, and political dimensions), digital adaptability, loneliness, and adoption intention. Study 3 demonstrates dynamic interconnections among digital equality (labor, government, and health dimensions), digital adaptability, identity threat, and adoption intention. Across three datasets, trust mediates the relationship between digital equality and adoption intention. Theoretical contributions to the emerging literature on decentralized finance (DeFi), AI-driven digital transformation, and AI-VR-convergence are discussed. DeFi businesses, enterprises, policy makers, educators, professional training providers, and workforce developers need to consider third-level digital (in)equality and digital adaptability in developing equitable, sustainable, and inclusive user experience (UX) in AI-empowered metaverses.

AB  - Technological advancements, urbanization, high energy demand, and global requirements to mitigate carbon footprints have led to the adoption of innovative green technologies for energy production. The integration of green technologies with traditional grids offers huge benefits. This amalgamation may bring a power mismatch dilemma due to intermittent renewable energy production and nonlinear energy consumption patterns which can affect the whole system’s reliability and operational efficiency. An efficient Energy Management System (EMS) is essential to deal with uncertainties associated with renewable energy production and load demand while optimizing the operation of distributed energy generation sources. This state-of-the-art review presents artificial intelligence-based solutions to improve EMS, focusing on optimal scheduling of generation sources, forecasting load and renewable energy production, and multi-agent-based decentralized control. The review’s finding suggests that the advanced metaheuristic algorithms can overcome challenges of trapping in local optima and premature convergence and due to this, they are now widely adopted and effectively utilized in scheduling problems. To mitigate uncertainties of renewable energy production and load demand, the long short-term memory and convolutional neural networks can manage spatiotemporal characteristics of renewable and load datasets and forecast highly accurate results. The multi-agent-based system offers a distributed control to complex problems that are computationally less expensive and outperforms centralized approaches. The increased use of advanced metaheuristic optimization techniques and hybrid machine learning and deep learning models is observed for optimization and forecasting applications. The advanced metaheuristic algorithms are a good addition to the literature, they are still in emerging stages and their performance can further be improved. This review also presents the decentralized and centralized EMS-based energy-sharing mechanism between interconnected micro grids. The use of advanced forecasting and metaheuristic algorithms can potentially handle the stochastic nature of renewable energy production and load demand.

AB  - Buildings account for a significant amount of energy consumption leading to the issues of global emissions and climate change. Thus, energy management in a building is increasingly explored due to its significant potential in reducing the overall electricity expenses for the consumers and mitigating carbon emissions. In line with that, the greater control and optimization of energy management integrated with renewable energy resources is required to improve building energy efficiency while satisfying indoor environment comfort. Even though actions are being taken to reduce the energy consumption in buildings with several optimization and controller techniques, yet some issues remain unsolved. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive review of the conventional and intelligent control methods with emphasis on their classification, features, configuration, benefits, and drawbacks. This review critically investigates the different optimization objectives and constraints with respect to comfort management, energy consumption, and scheduling. Furthermore, the review outlines the different methodological approaches to optimization algorithms used in building energy management. The contributions of controller and optimization in building energy management with the relation of sustainable development goals (SDGs) are explained rigorously. Discussions on the key challenges of the existing methods are presented to identify the gaps for future research. The review delivers some effective future directions that would be beneficial to the researchers and industrialists to design an efficiently optimized controller for building energy management toward targeting SDGs.

AB  - For the Internet of things (IoT) secure data aggregation issues, data privacy-preserving and limited computation ability and energy of nodes should be tradeoff. Based on analyzing the pros-and-cons of current works, a low energy- consuming secure data aggregation method (LCSDA) was proposed. This method uses shortest path principle to choose neighbor nodes and generates the data aggregation paths in the cluster based on prim minimum spanning tree algorithm. Simulation results show that this method could effectively cut down energy consumption and reduce the probability of cluster head node being captured, in the same time preserving data privacy.

AB  - The study is to perform thermodynamic, economic and thermoeconomic assessments for two different direct immersion cooling data center systems which are the single-phase and the two-phase immersion cooling systems with the operating ranges of 3.2–27.6 kW and 6.8–15.9 kW, respectively. The two-phase cooling system achieves 72–79% better coefficient of performance trends than the single-phase cooling system. According to the present worth method, the replacement and the energy costs are found as the most dominant future cost terms for the two-phase and the single-phase cooling systems, respectively. The annual exergy cost of the two-phase cooling system is found up to 4.91 times the annual energy costs due to the dominant effects of the destruction and loss terms. Moreover, both cooling data center systems are compared to the existing air-cooled data center unit. They are found economically infeasible for the server power rates below 5 kW because of their higher capital investment costs while they become more affordable for higher server power rates with lower future cost terms.

AB  - Conventionally, civil engineering is the branch mainly related to the construction of buildings, bridges, highways, etc. Presently, the scope of civil engineering is widening, and several new subdomains are under progression. A large number of experimental works are required to estimate the properties and tasks related to construction. The analytical models are not sufficient to actually predict these different tasks related to civil engineering. The various benefits of reducing experimental work are that it reduces waste as well as saves time and cost. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science, and nowadays, in all areas of research, engineering, and industry, AI applications are becoming widespread. In both directions, glocal (global to local) and lobal (local to global), AI is affecting human lives. AI techniques provide an alternative to traditional methods for a wide range of complex civil engineering issues, particularly in the fields of concrete technology, structural health monitoring, geotechnical engineering, transportation engineering, construction management, architectural engineering, indoor environmental quality, space structures, irrigation, environmental engineering, and structural analysis. AI is successful in areas where physical testing is not possible, which ultimately minimizes the time, expenditure, and human effort required by traditional testing methods. The main advantage of using AI technology is its capacity to make quick decisions and remove mistakes while giving quick results. It is evident from recent technical developments and AI applications that disruption of conventional patterns is eventually pounding on the door of civil engineering projects. What can we do to get ready for the subsequent changes? More significantly, how will we capitalize on the enormous possibilities that will arise? In this chapter, the basic information about AI and the application of AI in the different dimensions of civil engineering and its future are summarized from an immersive research viewpoint.

AB  - The manufacturing sector is getting revolutionized and newer efficient processes are emerging over the last decade. Intelligent manufacturing systems are in a growing trend in the manufacturing industry, where the focus is on improving the overall efficiency, productivity, net zero emissions, carbon neutrality, and sustainability of the production processes. As a result, intelligent manufacturing is becoming increasingly in line with the United Nations Goals, where sustainability is the major area for improvement in terms of clean energy, economic growth, industry, responsible production, and sustainable cities. The present work focuses on the recent trends in the intelligent, smart, and sustainable manufacturing domain. The combination of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing can be called smart advanced & automated manufacturing (SAAM) systems. For SAAM to achieve operational efficiency, the sustainability criterion needs to be achieved for any process. For a sustainable environment, it is necessary to reduce waste, and Industry 4.0 plays a vital role in reducing waste. This can be achieved through digital interconnectivity of manufacturing systems, real-time monitoring, and smart predictions via the internet of things (IOT) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, sustainability is a very vast term that is difficult to quantify; hence focus of this chapter is on the sustainability aspect of manufacturing processes based on process output where waste is reduced, and efficiency is enhanced. The purpose of this paper is to provide intelligent manufacturing solutions and methodologies from which the manufacturing world can be benefited by taking care of SDGs.

AB  - The utilization of digital technology is increasing rapidly and it is causing a growth in the number of data centers around the world. Data centers provide essential services, making them known as mission-critical. Like other mission-critical facilities, data centers often use reliability and availability analysis to evaluate the level of safety of their operations. Reliable electricity and cooling supplies are vital for the data center’s operation, and almost all data centers rely on the power grid to feed their electrical and cooling systems. However, the power grid is considered an unreliable source, and power grid fragility is a raising concern among data center operators. An alternative to the power grid is a sustainable combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system, which can supply continuous electricity and cooling to a data center while providing local energy generation, energy cost saving, and emission benefits. To understand the impact of a CCHP integration on the reliability and availability of a grid-fed data center, an up-to-date electrical topology design and reliability block diagram models were created that take into account both electricity and cooling supplies. The results showed that the overall system reliability of a grid-fed data center increased from 49.23% to 74.62% with a CCHP integration. In terms of availability, a grid-fed data center with 2N redundant topology achieved the industry-accepted high availability level of 0.99999, also known as 5-nines. Moreover, the use of CCHP at the grid-fed data center increased the availability from 5-nines to 7-nines for the overall system. Thus, CCHP integration to a grid-fed data center provided higher reliability and availability for the overall system for even 2N redundant topology data centers. Moreover, based on the life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis, integrating CCHP systems into data centers has a promising outcome. However, when conducting an LCC analysis, we recommend considering the realistic cost of downtime along with the reliability-related exposure to properly assess the viability of alternative energy systems by data center investors and operators.

AB  - Technology is becoming increasingly embedded within our material worlds, resulting in an exponential rise in the production and consumption of consumer electronics. Rapid innovations in technological systems reduce technology lifecycles, deprecating digital systems, rendering devices obsolete or incompatible with supporting infrastructure, resulting in the generation of electronic waste (e-waste). Sustainable unmaking practices are a promising avenue for harnessing and repurposing resources used in technology production, enabling us to move closer towards sustainable technology design. This paper presents an applied study investigating the pragmatics of sustainable unmaking, reporting on 12 semi-structured interviews conducted with domain experts engaged in unmaking with e-waste across diverse contexts in the consumer technology lifecycle.

AB  - This study examines the complex relationships among artificial intelligence (AI) adoption in organizations, employee work overload, and pro-environmental behavior at work (PEBW), while examining the moderating role of self-efficacy in AI learning. Drawing on several theories, we developed and tested a moderated mediation model utilizing a 3-wave time-lagged survey of 416 employees from diverse South Korean corporations. Our findings reveal that the link between AI adoption and PEBW is fully mediated by work overload, with AI adoption positively influencing work overload, which in turn negatively affects PEBW. Importantly, self-efficacy in AI learning moderates the AI adoption-work overload link, such that the positive influence is weaker for members with higher levels of self-efficacy. These results highlight the unintended consequences of AI adoption on environmental behaviors and underscore the significance of individual differences in shaping responses to technological change. The current research contributes to the literature by elucidating the mechanisms through which AI adoption influences PEBW and by identifying factors that can mitigate potential negative effects. The findings offer meaningful perspectives for organizations aiming to balance technological advancement with environmental sustainability goals, emphasizing the need for strategies that enhance members’ self-efficacy in AI learning and manage workload effectively. This paper advances our knowledge of the complex interplay between technological adoption, work experiences, and pro-environmental behaviors in contemporary organizational settings.

AB  - Background In England, COVID-19 has significantly affected mental health care and tested the resilience of health care providers. In many areas, the increased use of IT has enabled traditional modes of service delivery to be supported or even replaced by remote forms of provision. Objective This study aimed to assess the use and impact of IT, in remote service provision, on the quality and efficiency of mental health care during the pandemic. We drew on sociotechnical systems theory as a conceptual framework to help structure the gathering, analysis, and interpretation of data. Methods We conducted a national scoping survey that involved documentary analysis and semistructured interviews with 6 national stakeholders and case studies of 4 purposefully selected mental health providers in England involving interviews with 53 staff members. Results Following the outbreak of COVID-19, mental health providers rapidly adjusted their traditional forms of service delivery, switching to digital and telephone consultations for most services. The informants provided nuanced perspectives on the impact on the quality and efficiency of remote service delivery during the pandemic. Notably, it has allowed providers to attend to as many patients as possible in the face of COVID-19 restrictions, to the convenience of both patients and staff. Among its negative effects are concerns about the unsuitability of remote consultation for some people with mental health conditions and the potential to widen the digital divide and exacerbate existing inequalities. Sociotechnical systems theory was found to be a suitable framework for understanding the range of systemic and sociotechnical factors that influence the use of technology in mental health care delivery in times of crisis and normalcy. Conclusions Although the use of IT has boosted mental health care delivery during the pandemic, it has had mixed effects on quality and efficiency. In general, patients have benefited from the convenience of remote consultation when face-to-face contact was impossible. In contrast, patient choice was often compromised, and patient experience and outcomes might have been affected for some people with mental health conditions for which remote consultation is less suitable. However, the full impact of IT on the quality and efficiency of mental health care provision along with the systemic and sociotechnical determinants requires more sustained and longitudinal research.

AB  - The regional energy demand for Southern Africa has been predicted to increase by ten to fourteen times between the years 2010 and 2070. Thus, to address the proliferation of energy demand, South Africa’s integrated resource plan, which includes using renewable energy sources to increase the electricity supply and reduce the country’s carbon footprint, has been formulated. However, integrating renewable power into the power grid brings different dynamics for the system operators, as renewable power sources are variable and uncertain. Thus, accurate demand and generation forecasting become critical to the safe operation and ensuring continuity of supply, as consumers require. Due to the complexity of the earth’s atmosphere, weather forecasting uncertainty, and region-specific criteria, traditional forecasting models are limited. Thus, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and other artificial intelligence techniques are attractive possibilities for improving classical forecasting models. This study comprehensively reviewed relevant works on AI-based models for generation potential and load demand forecasting toward intelligent energy resource management and planning. The approach involved searching research databases and other sources for studies, reports, and publications on location-specific energy resource management using criteria such as demography, policy, and sociotechnical information. Consequently, the review study has highlighted how AI predictive analytics can enhance long-term energy resource potential and load forecasting toward improving electricity sector performance and promoting integrated energy system management implementation in South Africa.

It is extensively devoted to AI technology deployment relevant to disease management, healthcare delivery, epidemiology, and policy-making. However, its AI is culturally sensitive and ethically grounded in Islam. Based on the PRISMA framework, an SLR evaluated primary academic literature, cases, and practices of Saudi Arabia’s AI implementation in the public healthcare sector. Instead, it categorizes prior research based on how AI can work, the issues it poses, and its implications for the Kingdom’s healthcare system. The Saudi Arabian context analyses show that AI has increased the discreet prediction of diseases, resource management, and monitoring outbreaks during mass congregations such as hajj. Therefore, the study outlines critical areas for defining the potential for artificial intelligence and areas for enhancing digital development to support global healthcare progress. The key themes emerging from the review include Saudi Arabia: (i) the effectiveness of AI with human interaction for sustainable health services; (ii) conditions and quality control to enhance the quality of health care services using AI; (iii) environmental factors as influencing factors for public health care; (iv) Artificial Intelligence, and advanced decision-making technology for Middle Eastern health care systems. For policymakers, healthcare managers, and researchers who will engage with AI innovation, the review proclaims that AI applications should respect the country’s socio-cultural and ethical practices and pave the way for sustainable healthcare provision. More empirical research is needed on the implementation issues with AI, creating culturally appropriate models of AI, and finding new applications of AI to address the increasing demand for healthcare services in Saudi Arabia.

The SDGs are divided into three categories namely society, economy, and environment. This division allows us to come up with an overview of the general impact areas of AI. AI finds application in a wide array of environmental sectors, which include natural resource conservation, energy management, wildlife protection, pollution control and agriculture, clean energy, and waste management. AI will support energy systems having low carbon footprint with more energy efficiency, which are required to address climate change. AI can help in managing the complex ecosystem structure and functions effectively. Apart from above-mentioned applications it can also help in identifying desertification trends over large areas, in decision-making and environmental planning. Due to advent of many new technologies, AI can be now implemented in those countries which are having different cultural values and wealth. This has popularized the method all over the world. Advanced AI-based product design, technology, and research may require vast computational resources which can be made available through enormous computing centers. Such facilities require huge energy requirement and have massive carbon footprint. AI-based ecosystem information may cause exploitation of resources, although this kind of misuse has not been reported adequately. The AI development needs to be supported and guarded by the requisite regulatory body. The oversight will result in gaps in safety, transparency, and ethical standards. Today's need is to develop AI which is more eco-friendly not only today but for generations to come.

AB  - Many local governments have adopted digital innovations and advanced technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of things, and big data to address unprecedented problems, improve the processes and procedures of their services, and enhance citizen engagement. Yet, there are considerable variations in the adoption of digital innovation among local communities, and such variations lead to inequality in access to digital technologies among individuals, households, and other groups of different demographic and socioeconomic levels. Drawing on insights from institutional theory, this study examines whether community wealth, education level, and the presence of an independent IT department matter for a city's level of engagement with digital innovation and technologies. It examines a dataset obtained from the 2023 Local Digital innovation Survey with California city governments. A set of logistic regression analyses provide evidence that community wealth/education and independent IT departments play significant roles in influencing California city governments’ level of engagement with digital innovation and technologies.

AB  - Innovative information technology such as a Carbon Footprint Tracking App can contribute to achieve global climate targets like the 2 °C target of the Paris Agreement. This is particularly relevant for countries with strong socio-economic development, which often have high individual carbon footprints but also possess the technological advancements to help mitigate these emissions. This paper explores how carbon footprint feedback and goal-oriented appeals affect consumers' carbon emissions. Focusing on interventions in the food and mobility domains, this research distinguishes the impact of self-related and society-related goals across these focal domains and examines spillover effects on heating and other household activities. Using a Carbon Footprint Tracking App in a longitudinal experimental study with 210 participants over three waves, the following key findings emerge. First, goal activation affects carbon emissions differently across consumption domains. Second, while the obtained evidence points to spillover across domains, the appeals' effectiveness within the same domain is contingent on individual goal prioritization. In particular, behavioral interventions need to target specific goals within each domain, particularly normative and moral goals in the food domain, and hedonic and cost-related goals in the mobility domain.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is believed to have a significant potential use in tackling climate change. This paper explores the connections between AI and climate change research as a whole and its usefulness in climate change adaptation efforts in particular. Using a systematic review of the literature on applications of AI for climate change adaptation and a questionnaire survey of a multinational and interdisciplinary team of climate change researchers, this paper shows the various means via which AI can support research on climate change in diverse regions, and contribute to efforts towards climate change adaptation. The surveyed articles are classified under nine areas, e.g., Global/Earth Related; Water-related Issues and agriculture, 95% of which are related to adaptation. The areas that have attracted the most studies about AI applications are water-related management issues (38%). In terms of the survey results, the most robust agreements were noted concerning the capacity of digitisation and AI to strengthen governance practices and afford policy coherence in climate change. Evidence gathered in the study suggests that, provided that due care is taken, the use of AI can provide a welcome support to global efforts to better understand and handle the many challenges associated with a changing climate.

AB  - Addressing the global urgency for improved sustainable cities and communities, as per the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, requires innovative and disruptive approaches, which also include applying artificial intelligence (AI). While AI holds significant potential to address complex socio-economic and environmental challenges in cities, a comprehensive analysis of its applications and implications, particularly in urban contexts, is required to address the research gap in understanding how AI can be effectively deployed to meet the challenges. This paper reports on a study that evaluates how AI may facilitate achieving SDG 11. This assessment includes an expert-driven literature review, drawing insights from authoritative sources. In addition, a set of case studies illustrate practical applications of AI to improve urban sustainability. The combination of these approaches led to findings that underscore the pivotal role of AI in optimizing energy use, streamlining waste management, enhancing traffic flow, and contributing to environmental sustainability. However, according to the findings, AI implementation needs oversight to ensure it is ethical, inclusive, and privacy-respecting as an effective tool to aid decision-making. By fostering collaboration among planners, policymakers, and AI experts, the full potential of AI may be unlocked to shape sustainable urban environments and realize SDG 11.

AB  - Energy plays a vital part in stimulating economic progress, and the shift towards a cleaner energy system is highly significant for ensuring the sustainable development of the economy. China's energy structure urgently needs to be transitioned. The fast advancement and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) has provided a new and important tool for promoting the transition of energy structure. So, what is the relationship between the application of artificial intelligence and the transition of the energy structure? This research introduces artificial intelligence into the energy sector, focusing on the relationship between artificial intelligence and energy transition. Since nonlinear models are better able to study the complex effects and phase differences of artificial intelligence. Using China's provincial panel data spanning from 2006 to 2019, this study employs nonlinear modeling to explore the stage differences in the process of AI in facilitating energy structure transformation. This paper derives the following findings based on empirical research. First, there is a U-shaped relationship between artificial intelligence and the transition of energy structure. Specifically, before the inflection point, the initial application of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence may adversely impact energy transition. When the inflection point is passed, AI will help facilitate the energy transition. Second, the U-shaped relationship between AI and energy transition is more pronounced in coastal and non-resource-based regions. Third, energy intensity, government investment in science and technology, and informatization will moderate the U-shaped relationship between artificial intelligence and energy transition, changing the steepness of the original U-shaped relationship and even reversing it. Hence, it is imperative to effectively utilize the technological benefits of artificial intelligence through the development patterns and distinctive features of different regions, thereby facilitating the smooth transition of the energy structure.

AB  - The simultaneous maturation of multiple digital and telecommunications technologies in 2020 has created an unprecedented opportunity for ophthalmology to adapt to new models of care using tele-health supported by digital innovations. These digital innovations include artificial intelligence (AI), 5th generation (5G) telecommunication networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), creating an inter-dependent ecosystem offering opportunities to develop new models of eye care addressing the challenges of COVID-19 and beyond. Ophthalmology has thrived in some of these areas partly due to its many image-based investigations. Tele-health and AI provide synchronous solutions to challenges facing ophthalmologists and healthcare providers worldwide. This article reviews how countries across the world have utilised these digital innovations to tackle diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, refractive error correction, cataract and other anterior segment disorders. The review summarises the digital strategies that countries are developing and discusses technologies that may increasingly enter the clinical workflow and processes of ophthalmologists. Furthermore as countries around the world have initiated a series of escalating containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of eye care services globally has been significantly impacted. As ophthalmic services adapt and form a “new normal”, the rapid adoption of some of telehealth and digital innovation during the pandemic is also discussed. Finally, challenges for validation and clinical implementation are considered, as well as recommendations on future directions.

AB  - In recent years, with a rise in climate change, the notion of sustainable development and resource productivity has received a lot of attention around the world. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence based financial management and the creation of new blockchains or cryptocurrencies have transformed the day-to-day operations of economic actors. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of financial management and blockchains on environmental sustainability and resource productivity. The monthly time series data of the United States of America economy data is used covering the period from 2000M01–2022M09. Firstly, the stationary variable is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests. The findings reveal that all the variables follow I(1). The long-term estimations are investigated through the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares. The findings reveal that artificial intelligence-based financial management helps to improve environmental sustainability and resource productivity by reducing carbon emissions and increasing combustible and renewable waste, metals, and non-metallic minerals resources in the long run. In addition, blockchain technology appears to be a booster for environmental unsustainability while also reducing metallic resources. These findings are particularly important and critical since they indicate the path to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, the findings imply that the United States of America authorities should continue to push AI-based sustainability models and move to green blockchains in order to mitigate the negative environmental effects of blockchains.

AB  - Abstract: Falsification of product energy efficiency data affects the accuracy of carbon footprint tracking in green supply chain, and is not conducive to the achievement of carbon neutrality goals. Therefore, applying blockchain technology to eliminate the risk of fraudulent product energy efficiency data in the green supply chain, and then investigating its impacts on green supply chain decision-making is a new proposition worth studying. By constructing a Stackelberg game model including a manufacturer and a retailer, this paper analyzes the impacts of applying blockchain technology on green supply chain pricing decisions, carbon emission reduction and profit. We find that the increased risk of product energy efficiency data fraud will have negative impacts on product wholesale price, selling price, carbon emission reduction, and order quantity; Furthermore, the improvement of brand credibility brought about by the application of blockchain is conducive to enhancing the level of carbon emission reduction, and has essential impact on the wholesale price and the selling price, while the impacts of the marginal use cost of blockchain are the opposite. Finally, the triple factors including fixed cost, marginal usage cost and degree of brand credibility improvement jointly affect the profits of enterprises when applying blockchain. Our results have important managerial implications for government and companies who intend to improve their financial and environmental performance by applying blockchain technology in green supply chain.

AB  - Ensuring access to affordable energy for all is laid out among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and it remains an important open question as to how the popularity and widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workforce impact household energy resources consumption. To systematically investigate the impacts of the application of artificial intelligence in the workforce on household energy consumption in China, empirical analysis is conducted using data from the China General Social Survey (CGSS) from May to September 2022. The findings are as follows: (1) AI significantly reduces household energy consumption. Controlling other factors constant, for a one-standard-deviation increase in the impact of AI, household energy consumption drops by an average of 10.751%. Robustness and endogeneity tests, including dealing with missing values, using different energy consumption and AI indicators, as well as applying instrumental variable method, placebo test and penalized regressions, confirm this conclusion. (2) Mechanism analysis shows that AI reduces energy consumption by lowering household income and increasing their financial fragility. (3) AI's impacts on different types of energy consumption are heterogeneous. Its negative effects are mainly observed in the significant reduction of electricity and gas consumption. Furthermore, it increases the probability of using solid fuels such as honeycomb coal, coal lumps, traditional biomass, etc., thereby increasing the reliance on low-grade energy resources and raising the risk of energy poverty. (4) AI has greater negative effects on those who do not have access to energy subsidies and households with poor energy security and stability, lower income and inadequate social security. Besides, its impacts on regions with higher levels of technological development are more prominent. (5) Feasible pathways to mitigate the adverse effects of AI are explored. It is found that improving labor protection can help alleviate its adverse consequences on energy consumption. This paper provides evidence on the impacts of technological disruption from a demand-based perspective. It highlights the need for better policies on energy, social security, income distribution and labor protection to weaken AI's effects on household energy consumption and prevent them from falling into energy poverty.

AB  - The volume of landfill gas (LFG) produced during municipal solid waste (MSW) decomposition in local landfills has increased rapidly in recent years. To promote circular economy (CE) applications through resource recovery, this article investigates the feasibility of utilizing LFG as a sustainable energy to power data centers (DCs) in Xiamen (China) and evaluates the implications of waste heat reuse on the energy consumption of DC. The objective of this study was to investigate the environmental impacts and economic benefits of this scheme based on a SFC model. With respect to its novelty, LFG is utilized as an energy supply to DCs, while the waste heat generated in the energy production is recovered. The socio-economic benefits generated in this process are also elaborated. It was found that a large number of MSW was completely recycled to generate energy. The LFG enterprise could benefit from energy sale, while the energy satisfied the annual demand for DC power consumption. Utilizing this energy output resulted in the reduction of primary energy and less CO₂ emissions. By reusing the waste heat for domestic heating, the energy efficiency could be improved, while primary energy could be further saved, avoiding more CO₂ emissions. This implies that utilizing LFG output and waste heat to power DCs not only facilitate resource recovery from unused resources to improve energy efficiency and obtain socio-economic benefits, but also promote the digitalization of DCs and sustainable development of urban cities in the framework of CE.

AB  - Cloud computing is one of the powerful engines driving global industrial upgrading and the booming digital economy. However, the explosive growth of cloud data centers (DCs) has resulted in inevitable energy consumption and carbon emission problems. Therefore, constructing energy-efficient and sustainable DCs will be essential for green cloud computing. This review makes several efforts to thoroughly investigate and track the research progress and routes to sustainable DCs. Firstly, we construct a new conceptual model of sustainable DCs to cover cutting-edge research results and indicate future evolutionary directions. Secondly, this review provides a comprehensive survey of five topics from a technical perspective: workload management, virtual resource management, energy management, thermal management, and waste heat recovery. Subsequently, some real-world datasets relevant to the topics, including workload traces, renewable energy data, and electricity price traces, have been specifically collected to support researchers in conducting further research. Finally, based on observations of existing works, we highlight some salient technical challenges and promising solutions to provide sensible energy and carbon reduction suggestions in sustainable DCs.

AB  - A large amount of study focuses on the factors that determine the adoption of renewable energy and digital financial inclusion. However, more research may be done to determine how they affect sustainable development. On the one hand, initiatives for environmental protection may be viewed to benefit from digital financial inclusion. On the other hand, the high degree of financial inclusion via digital means may provide a chance to promote the human development index. Because of this, our research aims to add to the body of knowledge by examining the key role of renewable energy consumption and digital financial inclusion in the instance of nations participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. The obtained results show that digital financial inclusion raises the study region’s economic growth and human development index. On the basis of the results, helpful policy recommendations are made for rising nations.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between private investment, digitalization, and coal rent in major coal-consuming countries from 1999 to 2019. Using the CS-FMOLS technique, the results show that a 1% increase in the ICT Development Index raises coal rent by 0.24%, underscoring digitalization's role in enhancing coal industry profitability. Conversely, a 1% increase in private participation in infrastructure reduces coal rent by 0.35%, as private investments focus on sustainable energy. The study concludes that while private investment supports clean energy, digitalization extends coal reliance. To support coal transition, policies should promote green ICT production, renewable energy, green finance, and good governance in sustainable projects.

AB  - The arrival of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the quick advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and internet of things (IoT) have led to the beginning of a new technological revolution in agriculture. As an important branch of agricultural robots, field robots have an irreplaceable role in guaranteeing food security, seizing the global agricultural high ground, and realizing sustainable agricultural development. In this study, we first clarified the definition of field robots and review the different development stages of agricultural robots. Secondly, we searched and screened 678 relevant literature from electronic databases such as Science Direct, Web of Science, etc., and quantitatively analyzed all the literature in terms of three dimensions: year of publication, country, and keywords. Then, we systematically provided the current research status of ploughing-seeding, weeding, monitoring, harvesting, and information-gathering, crop protection and agricultural fly robots. Furthermore, the global development of field robots shows a trend of rapid growth and technology upgrading, and we proposed the common key technologies of field robots, including intelligent sensing, smart decision-making and control, dexterous arm and hand operation, autonomous and stable walking, and Cloud-Edge-End fusion intelligent operation. Finally, we summarized the challenges faced by robots, such as low sensing accuracy, poor operability, and low operating efficiency. Therefore, we attempted to provide new opportunities for the future development of field robots, such as new technologies such as unstructured information analysis, 5G, AI, digital twins, robots swarms collaboration, and other technologies, which enable the realization of field operation scenarios with fully autonomous perception.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the role of industrial Internet platform in facilitating the digital transformation of traditional manufacturing enterprises. While prior research has predominantly focused on industrial Internet platform enterprises, there is a noticeable dearth of research concerning traditional manufacturing enterprises lacking the resources to establish such platforms. To address this research gap, we conduct an exploratory case study and propose an affordances upgrade model that elucidates the digital business transformation process of these manufacturing enterprises leveraging industrial Internet platforms. The research findings can be summarized from two key perspectives. Firstly, the industrial Internet platform offers valuable technical support and potential opportunities for manufacturing enterprises to achieve digital business transformation through three distinct affordances: consonance, resonance, and adaptation. These affordances enable enterprises to align their operations with the capabilities and possibilities provided by the platform, thus facilitating their digital transformation. Secondly, to effectively harness these affordances, enterprises must strategically leverage the platform's technical services and systems in their production and operational practices. Through the accumulation of practical experiences, enterprises gradually transition their production modes from experience institutionalization and standardization to a state of refinement. The dynamic leapfrogging process of digital transformation in traditional manufacturing enterprises, facilitated by the industrial Internet platform, is reflected in the realization of these three affordances and their underlying resource capabilities. This research significantly contributes to the field by expanding the scope of inquiry to encompass traditional manufacturing enterprises and presenting a stage model for their digital transformation utilizing industrial Internet platform.

AB  - This paper makes the first attempt to look at the response of the energy market to the shock from the AI industry and the role of AI in the energy market risk spillover network. The innovation of the paper lies in adopting a quantile-based and time-varying framework in the empirical analysis. This enables us to reveal the cross-quantile and lead-lag correlations between AI and the energy market. We find that an extreme negative shock from AI tends to correspond to an extreme downward movement in crude oil, gasoline, gas oil, and clean energy markets and the shock response dissipates after 66 days. Meanwhile, the cross-quantile correlations are subject to structural changes once the extreme events arrive. As for the total spillover effect of the energy market, it increases by 5.34 % after AI is considered as a source of uncertainty in the risk spillover network dominated by the crude oil market. Thus, the shock from AI challenges the stability of the energy market. A close relationship between the AI industry and the clean energy market is also identified. We contribute to studying the relationship between the AI industry and the energy market from the perspective of the risk connectedness between the two fields.

AB  - E-commerce has emerged as a transformative force in economic development during the digital era. Amid the intensifying challenges of global climate change and environmental degradation, the role of e-commerce in addressing broader issues such as air pollution has become increasingly significant. The pursuit of sustainable development goals places higher expectations on e-commerce platforms to enhance business ecosystems and contribute to air quality governance. The establishment of National E-commerce Demonstration Cities is a key policy initiative in China aimed at encouraging the healthy and rapid development of e-commerce. This paper seeks to evaluate the air purification effects of this policy initiative. To this end, we use data from 279 cities in China spanning the years 2005–2021 and employ a multi-period Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to examine the air purification effects and underlying mechanisms of e-commerce development. The findings reveal that the National E-commerce Demonstration City policy has significantly reduced air pollution. E-commerce development contributes to air purification by facilitating industrial structure upgrading and reducing energy consumption intensity. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the air purification effects of e-commerce are stronger in eastern and western regions of China, as well as in areas characterized by lower levels of marketization, logistics capacity, and urban consumption. Further analysis suggests that the air purification effects are more pronounced in regions with relatively moderate levels of air pollution. Finally, we provide policy recommendations and strategies for leveraging e-commerce development to effectively improve air quality in the future.

AB  - Although China boasts the largest online consumption market, there has been no prior case study addressing the carbon footprint of online consumption. The rapid expansion of online consumption has posed a challenge to China's carbon neutrality pledge. This paper aims to fill this crucial gap by conducting a pioneering study based on survey data collected from 6000 households. To achieve this goal, this study has combined provincial Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) tables with residents' online consumption calculated by the Non-Linear Optimization model, and applied the Environmental Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) model to calculate the carbon footprint of residents' online consumption. Result indicated that the average carbon footprint of residents' online consumption was 0.46 tCO2e in 2016, accounting for 12.30% of the total consumption carbon footprint. Notably, high-emission regions include Beijing-Tianjin, Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai, and Hubei. Moreover, the dominant sources of the online consumption carbon footprint were electricity, food, clothing, and beauty products. Furthermore, we found that the carbon footprint of online consumption tends to increase with income, with differential income elasticities observed for various products and income groups. We also quantified the average expenditure-based life-cycle carbon coefficient for parcel delivery (0.22 kgCO2e/yuan) and conducted two scenario analyses to assess its impact. From a policy perspective, our research on measuring the carbon footprint of residents' online consumption can provide valuable insights for designing future policies and decisions related to e-commerce and key sectors along the supply chains. Additionally, it will further encourage Chinese residents to adopt low-carbon lifestyles.

AB  - Energy Poverty (EP) is a widespread problem in Europe. EP detection is hampered by a lack of data and global metrics. Recently, innovative approaches using Artificial Intelligent (AI) techniques have been increasingly applied for the EP alleviation. In this work, studies focused on the application of AI on EP were studied. It was identified that there is not a high number of works that apply AI to fight against EP (considering this problem as a multidimensional phenomenon). Artificial Neural Networks-based algorithms and Decision Trees were the most used algorithms in the reviewed literature focused on EP alleviation. However, several AI applications focused on partial aspects of the EP or on areas intimately related to EP (low-income, high-energy price and low-energy efficiency of buildings) that allow the characterization of the problem in an efficient way have been published in recent years; the last 7 years published literature have been reviewed in this work. It was found that Neural Networks algorithms were the most used models for low-income, energy price and poor energy efficiency characterizations. Support Vector Machines-based algorithms were the most popular AI method applied on energy consumption related problems. Deep learning was the most popular technique for detecting energy billing irregularities and unpaid energy bills.

AB  - Given the ongoing digitalization process in financial sector, the interaction between the energy transition and digital inclusive finance (DIF) can potentially affect the decarbonization process towards carbon neutrality. This paper utilizes an unbalanced panel data of Chinese firms spanning from 2011 to 2015 to estimate the impact of DIF on firms' low carbon energy transition with a fixed-effect model. The findings reveal that the development of DIF has a significantly negative effect on firms' consumption of fossil fuels. These findings remain robust even after employing a series of robustness tests and implementing an instrumental variable approach to address potential endogeneity concerns. Investigations of the underlying mechanism reveal that DIF primarily promotes the energy transition by increasing firms' investment in information and communications technology (ICT) and green technologies. Moreover, DIF plays a particularly significant role in promoting the energy transition of non-state-owned firms, small firms, non-energy-intensive firms, and firms in the eastern region. This paper suggests leveraging the positive role of DIF in the energy transition of firms, especially by encouraging firms to invest in sustainable technologies to accelerate their energy transition. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for coordinated development of DIF in different regions and addresses the imbalance in firms' energy transition across these regions.

AB  - In remote areas, particularly in developing countries, there is a growing interest in off-grid solar PV systems for their ability to provide clean and affordable electricity. However, these systems often face limitations in powering essential amenities, including sports facilities, due to restricted capabilities and inadequate battery storage. To address these challenges and promote energy independence, this paper proposes an AI-enabled sports-system peer-to-peer (P2P) energy exchange network within the digital economy. This innovative system leverages AI to optimize energy distribution specifically for sports-related infrastructures, ensuring efficient use of solar power and improved energy availability for both recreational and community needs. The proposed P2P network operates on a three-part Internet of Things (IoT) framework, facilitating automatic energy sharing among interconnected systems. This approach not only enhances the performance of existing solar power setups but also ensures that energy demands for sports facilities are met effectively. Feasibility studies of this system reveal promising outcomes, including a 13.67% increase in community energy independence and a 12.20% reduction in overall energy consumption. The AI-powered sports-system network demonstrates its potential to support sustainable development and improve the quality of life in remote areas by integrating sports and energy needs within the digital economy context.

These platforms - such as Uber, Airbnb, Couchsurfing, BlaBlaCar, and many others - are predominantly associated with the sharing economy phenomenon. Due to affordability, efficiency, convenience and accessibility of their services, sharing platforms have appeared to be an attractive way of accessing resources for consumers. From a sustainability perspective, it is however important to investigate how the growth of digitally enabled sharing can affect the prevailing consumption patterns as well as socio-economic structures. The present work aims to address the category of potential sustainability impacts of shared consumption and sharing practices on the environment and society that should be considered in designing digital sharing systems in order to see how they can promote or hinder sustainability.

AB  - The livelihood of smallholder farmers in emerging economies' cocoa supply chain is substandard because of fraud, exploitation, corruption, deceit, child labor, and financial exclusion, usually perpetrated by influential actors. This situation creates a social sustainability problem which needs urgent attention. Digital technologies such as sensors, drones, satellites, and blockchain show promise toward fostering social sustainability deep into the supply chain. This innovation is consistent with the United Nations 2030 sustainable development goals of transforming world economies toward a more sustainable future vision by reducing poverty and inequality. As our contribution, we adopt a traditional approach in our perspective article to initiate a scholarly curiosity to discuss and develop research needs on how to use technology to address this current and critical sustainability and supply chain concern. Blockchain can solve the inefficiencies, complexities, and other social issues of smallholder farmers in the supply chain. This article identifies some blockchain technologies in emerging economies, such as Hara Technology in Indonesia and Cellulant Agrikore Blockchain Solution in Nigeria. Again, we observed that the promise of using technology to improve smallholders' vulnerability in the cocoa supply chain remains underexploited in Africa and other emerging economies. Therefore, rigorous research on smallholders' social sustainability is needed to make sound policy recommendations. This short perspective article describes issues facing these smallholder farmers and how technology can play a role for them and their supply chains to alleviate various social and environmental concerns. Accordingly, we propose some research questions for technology, innovation, and engineering management researchers.

AB  - The global interest in the digital supply chain (DSC) has progressively increased due to the recent industrial revolution and pandemic demand for digital technologies. As a result, the implementation of DSC is highly critical; however, the implementation guidelines are still scarce and vague, especially on the standard implementation components such as critical success factors (CSFs) and barriers in the DSC implementation. The current study shows a systematic literature review of 72 articles on DSC implementation in the food supply chain (FSC) through technology, operation, and managerial dimension. The result shows the top three CSFs are the market pressure of an organisation, the knowledge, and training about the technology implementation and existing infrastructures. In contrast, expensive initial costs, a lack of skills, and a lack of inspiration are common barriers to implementing DSC in the food industry. This research will facilitate academics and food industry practitioners better understand how to adopt digital supply chains before investing in and planning supply chain (SC) digitalisation.

AB  - 5G wireless communication systems provide massive system capacity with high data rates, very short low-latency, and ultra-high reliability, in addition to high connection density with a positive experience on smart cities and the Internet of Things (IoT). Future networks are anticipated to revolutionize typical applications such as the enhanced mobile broadband services (EMBB), ultra-reliable low latency communication (uRLLC), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC) anywhere and everywhere. This rationalizes the need to investigate the sustainable elements of 5G networks in smart cities to understand how 5G networks can be more environmentally- friendly and energy-efficient. This paper aims to investigate how 5G networks can act as key enablers in achieving sustainability in smart cities, using a macroscopic review. An overview of 5G communication networks and several 5G technologies used in smart city applications to enhance sustainability is presented. This is followed by investigating the indicators that measure sustainability in 5G networks across the environmental, social, and economic dimensions; and sub-dimensions such as energy efficiency, power consumption, carbon footprint, pollution, cost, health, safety, and security. The results show that the majority of research papers focus on the environmental dimensions of sustainability (42%) when attempting to address sustainability in 5G systems and smart cities. The findings also showed a huge interest in the economic (37%) and social (21%) dimensions as well. Further, when examining the sub-dimensions, it was found that most of the studies focused on energy efficiency (20%), power consumption (17%), and cost (15%).

AB  - Climate action is one of the United Nations Sus-tainable Development Goals. We contribute to this effort by analyzing climate change topics on the Reddit social curation platform, which contains over 100,000 discussion communities. We leverage the community-oriented structure of Reddit to answer two questions: 1) Which online communities discuss climate change? and 2) What do they discuss? In addition to the presence of groups of activists and skeptics, we find climate change discussions on question-answering and opinion-sharing communities, as well as in a community for teenagers. We then run a topic modeling algorithm on the five largest climate change communities. We find concerns about skeptics, political policies doubting the severity of climate change and the consequences of climate change, as well as discussions of climate actions that can be taken by individuals. Finally, an analysis of the URLs mentioned in discussions highlights influential content creators and underscores the need to avoid misinformation on these sources.

The primary focus of this paper is SDG7, which calls for access to affordable and clean energy. Artificial intelligence (AI), is one of the emerging technologies to be utilized. Fuzzy logic (FL), artificial neural networks (ANNs), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and artificial bee colony (ABC) are some of the AI techniques that have advanced engineering. In today's smart grid (SG), these techniques offer strong tools for design, simulation and fault control. Despite this, many developing nations, particularly those in the sub-Saharan Africa region, lack clean energy. This paper simulates a hybrid inverter-based system and reviews the application of AI to enhance the performance of smart grids to succeed in SDG7. Results show that heuristic approaches have performed effectively.

AB  - Algeria's agricultural output has been greatly influenced by the unfavorable effects of climate change in Africa. The main developments and adoption prospects for agricultural technology are examined in this article, with an emphasis on their intellectualization, digitization, and Big Data integration. Furthermore, it presents the idea of the cognitive visual environment as a potentially effective way to improve smart agriculture practices in Algeria. In order to maximize agribusiness operations, the study investigates the possibilities of the cognitive visual environment by utilizing cutting-edge technology, data analytics, and intelligent systems. This study uses Python to examine unemployment data for Algeria from 1991 to 2021, processing and analyzing the data using Hadoop and PySpark. The goal of the study is to pinpoint temporal trends in the unemployment rate as well as the variables that contribute to the persistently high rate of unemployment. The results show that despite fluctuations, the unemployment rate was continuously high. Low private sector job growth, a lack of economic diversity, and a skills gap are all factors that contribute to high unemployment. For decision-makers and professionals attempting to address Algeria's unemployment, these insights are helpful. This study adds to the expanding body of literature on using Hadoop and big data for economic analysis, emphasizing the value of using cutting-edge analytical tools for well-informed decision-making.

Our architecture addresses the authenticity and integrity of devices and processes within heterogeneous system landscapes. We identify and discuss the current challenges in digital supply chains and lay out security, privacy, and interoperability requirements that must be met for successful implementation. We hypothesize that the overall perception of trust in a supply chain depends on the trustworthiness of all digital systems involved, including hardware, software, and information flow. Our proposed architecture helps enhance trustworthiness based on verifiable, indisputable, and believable digital evidence for devices and processes in supply chains, including the entire hardware and software lifecycles. We actively advocate for a mixed landscape of centralized and decentralized solutions for the storage of evidence and trust information. This can include traditional centralized databases and distributed ledger technologies. We discuss the auditability and accountability of digital evidence using trust-enabling technologies, and present a preliminary proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation in a real-world application scenario.

The primary objective is to maximize the utilization of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power by developing a modeling and optimization tool for the energy system prototype. The overarching goal is to mitigate carbon emissions and foster sustainable development in the area. Aligned with Germany's energy transition and the German Climate Change Act, this project contributes to the country's broader objectives of transitioning to renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy transition exemplifies successful renewable energy adoption in urban areas, driven by local initiatives, ambitious targets, and supportive policy frameworks. Unlike previous models relying on average estimations for calculating renewable energy potential, this model introduces a digitalized approach that organizes data more efficiently and effectively handles large datasets. It transitions from district-by-district analysis to city-wide assessments with just one operation.

AB  - The energy industry is undergoing a significant transition from fossil fuel to sustainable energy sources, driven by decarbonization, as well as the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as climate action and affordable and clean energy initiatives. Energy transition needs to balance an energy trilemma problem among energy security (including reliability and resilience), affordability or equity, and environmental sustainability. The energy transition is at hand, but its success relies on our ability to adapt our aging power grid infrastructure to support the entire ecosystem around it. Innovation and the digital transformation of the grid substation are crucial to evolving our technology rapidly enough to meet the world’s rising demands of green energy.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) contain spatially distributed sensor nodes that can sense, record, and distribute physical and environmental parameters and are involved in daily life with a large number of applications, such as disaster relief, target tracking, environmental control, smart cities, medicine and health care. A typical wireless sensor network consists of a large number of low-cost, multifunctional sensor nodes that typically run on a limited battery and are deployed to monitor a desired area of interest. The limited energy supply of sensor nodes directly affects the lifetime of the network. As a consequence, energy-efficient modes of operation of WSNs are extremely important to extend the network lifetime, in order to achieve this goal, energy-efficient protocols and algorithms are intensively studied. An insight into previous research related to the security of wireless networks and improving the energy efficiency of wireless sensor networks reveals problems related to the lifetime of individual nodes, network reliability and data transmission security, and optimal distribution of the network into clusters. Each of the mentioned protocols brought an improvement in energy conservation, but also opened up additional possibilities for improvement by combining already existing solutions but also by implementing new parameters for sustainable business model and energy efficiency improvement of wireless sensor networks in the digital age that the authors will explore and present in this paper.

AB  - The digitization, digitalization and digital transformation of vegetable supply chains in developing economies has emerged as a promising solution to address the challenges of efficiency, transparency, and information management. This research focuses on the case study of Sri Lanka, a developing economy in Asia, to understand the complexities and information gaps present in its traditional vegetable supply chain. By conducting in-depth interviews and value chain analysis, the study identifies the prevailing digital transformation behaviors among stakeholders, with most falling under the categories of “Paper Masters” and “Digital Migrants,” demonstrating limited digital adoption. To address these challenges and promote digital transformation, a conceptual framework is proposed, involving a data collection platform through a mobile-based application. The platform aims to enhance efficiency, transparency, and decision-making by enabling real-time data collection and sharing among stakeholders. However, the adoption of digital technologies faces obstacles, such as inadequate digital infrastructure, traditional mindsets, financial constraints, and limited digital literacy. Despite these challenges, the study highlights the potential benefits of digital transformation, including optimized resource allocation, increased transparency, and reduced waste in terms of material, financial, and information. Ultimately, the study provides valuable insights for developing economies to embrace digital transformation and build more sustainable and efficient vegetable supply chains for the future.

AB  - This research redefines “smart homes” by aligning them with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the integration of traditional sustainable architectural techniques with modern ICT systems. Typically focused on connectivity, automation, and convenience, conventional smart homes emphasize high-tech solutions for comfort and energy efficiency. However, this study critiques the technological dependency of current smart homes, suggesting a more balanced approach. By incorporating passive design strategies-rooted in traditional architecture that naturally adapts to environmental conditions—with advanced technology, a “smart passive design” paradigm is proposed. This hybrid strategy utilizes case studies of traditional and contemporary houses in hot climates to evaluate building materials and envelope performance. The findings advocate for environmentally and operationally efficient homes, blending time-tested techniques with modern systems, which are more sustainable and resilient in the face of climate change.

AB  - This research was carried out at the Tres Valles Sugar Company located in Cantarranas, Honduras, and focuses on reducing energy consumption and improving economic feasibility in industrial processes through the implementation of variable frequency drives (VFDs). The study seeks to address the challenge of energy efficiency in critical industrial sectors, which play a significant role in global energy consumption, particularly in emerging economies. The proposed approach utilizes affinity laws of centrifugal pumps and recurrent neural networks (LSTM) to more accurately predict energy consumption in a closed-loop control system, replacing traditional flow control methods with VFD-based systems. This contributes to achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting more efficient, reliable, and affordable energy systems in industrial applications, supporting cleaner energy use and reducing environmental impact. The study highlights the potential for significant energy savings and economic benefits in developing economies, where energy efficiency is key to sustainable development. Results indicate an estimated annual energy saving of 21,249.15 kWh and a payback period of approximately 1.84 years. The model’s accuracy, with an average discrepancy of only 2.41% between predicted and actual energy consumption after VFD installation, underscores its value for energy management in industrial processes. This work demonstrates that the integration of advanced technologies like VFDs and machine learning can lead to more sustainable, energy-efficient solutions in critical infrastructure sectors.

AB  - The main energy demand of the globe is provided by fossil fuels, which are nonrenewable and can no longer be utilized once depleted specifically at buildings. Hydrogen as the highest environmentally friendly fuel, is a renewable and clean fuel with a potential to be an energy carrier for the next generation. It also has the capacity to replace the current fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure and refinery products for building energy consumptions. This is seen and projected as a remedy for the aforementioned issues, such as global warming and environmental deterioration. The most significant elements to consider while establishing hydrogen infrastructure are environmental conditions. In this study, by the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach in MATLAB, H2 thermal and storage rate were ultimately predicted. The outcome of the spiral-shaped thermal collector with water was superior to that of the other hydrogen generation methods. The findings predicted by ANN approaches demonstrate an outstanding correlation with the experimental outcomes. Consequently, it is recommended that the constructed ANN model might be utilized to estimate the performance of the H2 storage system in future research.

This paper investigates energy consumption issues from widespread 5G deployment using city-scale real-world mobile network data. Our dataset includes traffic volume, energy consumption, and base station attributes spanning May 2022, July 2023, and April 2024, covering over 10,000 4G and 5,000 5G base stations. A portion of the dataset is published on GitHub. We develop high-accuracy models to profile 4G and 5G base station energy consumption, revealing 5G inefficiencies under low traffic loads. We identify energy efficiency traps where network energy efficiency drops post-5G deployment. Our study estimates the recovery time from energy efficiency traps, emphasizes that different functional regions have varying recovery levels, and analyzes the reasons for these differences. We provide recommendations for deploying and commercializing 5G to promote sustainable connectivity.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of digital economy on carbon emissions and energy transition, focusing on G-20 countries and Chinese cities from 2008 to 2021. Using data from 276 Chinese cities, we employ an IV-GMM regression model to assess the role of digital economy in addressing the energy trilemma—balancing sustainability, energy security, and affordability. The findings reveal that while digital technologies enhance energy efficiency and facilitate the shift towards low-carbon industries, and also increase overall energy consumption due to the growing digital infrastructure. The empirical analysis has identified key pathways, such as industrial restructuring and foreign investment attraction, through which digital economy influenced the energy transition. Based on these results, we recommend that G-20 and Chinese policymakers to promote environmental sustainability, ensure reliable energy systems, and support long-term development goals.

AB  - Achieving synergies between energy conservation (EC) and carbon emission reduction (CER) at the firm level is essential for addressing global energy challenges and supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study explores the role of digital technology (DT) in driving EC-CER synergies, using panel data from 4165 Chinese A-share listed firms (2010–2022). Drawing on upper echelons theory and two-way fixed-effects regression analysis, we demonstrate that DT significantly enhances the combined impact of EC and CER. A Chief Digital Officer (CDO) further strengthens this effect. Mechanism analysis reveals that green technological innovation (GTI) and improved environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance are critical pathways. Heterogeneity analysis shows more substantial synergies in non-state-owned enterprises and firms outside eastern regions. These findings provide empirical evidence of DT's role in advancing energy conservation and sustainability, offering actionable insights for corporate strategies and policy development.

AB  - Despite widespread adoption and outstanding performance, machine learning models are considered as “black boxes”, since it is very difficult to understand how such models operate in practice. Therefore, in the power systems field, which requires a high level of accountability, it is hard for experts to trust and justify decisions and recommendations made by these models. Meanwhile, in the last couple of years, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques have been developed to improve the explainability of machine learning models, such that their output can be better understood. In this light, it is the purpose of this paper to highlight the potential of using XAI for power system applications. We first present the common challenges of using XAI in such applications and then review and analyze the recent works on this topic, and the on-going trends in the research community. We hope that this paper will trigger fruitful discussions and encourage further research on this important emerging topic.

AB  - CONTEXT The transition to digital agriculture is likely to lead to systemic changes that will affect production, consumption, governance, and the wider environment of agricultural systems. Nevertheless, the absence of sufficient evidence and ambiguities in perspectives create an ongoing lack of clarity regarding the potential impacts of digital agriculture. Therefore, to discern potential impacts while addressing system complexities, uncertainties, as well as normative aspects associated with this transition, future-oriented and participatory assessments are needed that actively involve diverse knowledge and values of affected stakeholders. OBJECTIVE This research aims to explore the impacts and processes of agricultural digitalization according to stakeholders. The objectives are to identify key areas of impact that digital agriculture is likely to influence, identify and explore the causal pathways linking digital agriculture to impacts, and quantitatively examine the uncertainties of stakeholder perceptions associated with these impacts and causal pathways. METHODS Through a participatory modelling procedure, diverse stakeholders from the German region of Brandenburg constructed a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). The BBN facilitated the identification of the main impacts of digital agriculture and allowed for the modelling of uncertainties associated with these impacts. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Stakeholders perceived several socioeconomic advantages of digitalization, particularly in terms of bolstering economic stability through improved risk management and enhanced resource use efficiency, validating existing claims in the literature. The perception seems to be influenced by highly variable yields and market uncertainties, as well as shortages in labour in the region. On the other hand, there was significant uncertainty among stakeholders concerning landscape diversification and its impact on biodiversity. This uncertainty arises from the potential profitability of cultivating marginal land under heightened digitalization-induced efficiency, posing a risk of diminishing natural habitat and landscape heterogeneity. Local historical trends toward landscape simplification as result of technology-driven efficiency improvements may be a cause for this perception. SIGNIFICANCE This study contributes to a growing body of future-oriented research assessing the impacts of digital agriculture through engaging stakeholder knowledge and values. While there is theoretical potential for digitalization to enhance biodiversity, realizing such positive impacts is improbable without improved communication and policy incentives, given the historical trend of efficiency-driven pathways. This study introduces a novel approach to assessing the impacts of agricultural digitalization through the application of a participatory Bayesian belief network.

AB  - This study explores the interlink between AI capabilities and circular business models (CBMs) through a literature review. Extant literature reveals that AI can act as efficiency catalyst, empowering firms to implement CBM. However, the journey to harness AI for CBM is fraught with challenges as firms grapple with the lack of sophisticated processes and routines to tap into AI's potential. The fragmented literature leaves a void in understanding the barriers and development pathways for AI capabilities in CBM contexts. Bridging this gap, adopting a capabilities perspective, this review intricately brings together four pivotal capabilities: integrated intelligence capability, process automation and augmentation capability, AI infrastructure and platform capability, and ecosystem orchestration capability as drivers of AI-enabled CBM. These capabilities are vital to navigating the multi-level barriers to utilizing AI for CBM. The key contribution of the study is the synthesis of an AI-enabled CBM framework, which not only summarizes the results but also sets the stage for future explorations in this dynamic field.

AB  - Decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization are essential for advanced energy systems (AES), which encompass smart grids, renewable energy integration, and demand response initiatives. Digitalization is a significant trend that transforms societal, economic, and environmental processes globally. This shift moves us from traditional power grids to decentralized, intelligent networks that enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. By integrating data and connectivity, these technologies optimize energy production, distribution, and consumption. This article presents a comprehensive literature review of four closely related emerging technologies: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain, and Digital Twin (DT) in AES. Our findings from the previous works indicate that AI significantly improves Demand Response strategies by enhancing the prediction, optimization, and management of energy consumption. Techniques like linear regression effectively predict power demand and aggregated loads, while more complex methods such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) and reinforcement learning (RL) optimize appliance scheduling and load forecasting. The integration of IoT technologies into Energy Management Systems (EMS) further enhances efficiency and sustainability through real-time monitoring and automated control. Additionally, DT technology aids in simulating energy scenarios and optimizing consumption in both residential and commercial smart grids. Our findings also emphasize blockchain’s role in creating decentralized energy trading platforms, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions, and enhancing trust through smart contracts. The insights gained from this review highlight the essential role of these emerging technologies in supporting decentralized, intelligent energy networks, offering valuable strategies for stakeholders to navigate the complexities of the evolving digital energy landscape.

AB  - The push for digital transformation in the healthcare sector offers promising potential for reducing waste, enhancing resource utilization, and significantly diminishing the carbon footprint of healthcare operations. However, a pivotal challenge that emerges in the quest for a greener healthcare supply chain is interoperability. Through a qualitative methodology, this study delved into the interoperability challenges within Singapore's public healthcare supply chain by conducting in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. The analysis revealed four primary interoperability challenges: technological, data-centric, social, and stakeholder-related obstacles. These challenges span both social and technical aspects, aligning with a socio-technical system perspective. In response, this research proposes a conceptual framework for a digital-enabled, green public healthcare supply chain. The framework comprises four interrelated components to tackle the interoperability challenges: adopting an ecosystem perspective, fostering resilience orientation for the healthcare supply chain, recognizing the pivotal role of technology as a driver and enabler, and implementing necessary management changes and support. The findings of this study are poised to make a substantial contribution to integrating healthcare operations with broader sustainability objectives, advancing towards the goal of net-zero emissions.

AB  - In general, agriculture plays a crucial role in human survival as a primary source of food, alongside other sources such as fishing. Unfortunately, global warming and other environmental issues, particularly in less privileged nations, hamper the Agricultural sector. It is estimated that a range of 720 to 811 million individuals experienced food insecurity. Today's agriculture faced significant difficulties and obstacles, as do the surveillance and monitoring systems (climate, energy, water, fields, works, cost, fertilizers, diseases, etc.). The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the susceptibilities and insufficiencies inherent in worldwide food systems. Current agricultural practices tend to prioritize productivity and profitability over environmental conservation and long-term sustainability. To establish sustainable agriculture capable of meeting the needs of a projected ten billion people in the next 30 years, substantial structural and automation changes are required. However, these obstacles can be overcome by employing smart technologies and advancing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in agricultural operations. AI is believed to contribute to global sustainability goals in multiple sectors, particularly in the incorporation of renewable energy. It is anticipated that AI will revitalize both existing and new agricultural fields by retrofitting, installing and integrating automatic devices and instruments. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the most promising and novel applications of AI in the agriculture industry. Furthermore, the role of AI in the transition to sustainability and precision agriculture is investigated.

AB  - Despite the recent hype surrounding the transition from a publicly funded space industry to a commercially driven New Space Economy, the potential of space technology to address societal challenges remains largely underexplored. In response to recent calls to consider private firms as active contributors to addressing the grand challenges associated with the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, this study builds on previous research on sustainable business model innovation and adopts a technology affordance perspective to examine how firms can leverage space technology for sustainable innovation. Through a comparative multiple case study of 11 international entrepreneurial ventures in the New Space Economy, we identify three key space technology affordances that align the value mechanisms of their business models with their contributions to sustainability goals. Specifically, our findings illustrate how entrepreneurial ventures use space technology to overcome transaction obstacles in reaching and including previously excluded stakeholders, employing space technology as a sharpshooter, Trojan horse, or piggy bank in their pursuit of sustainable business model innovation. This study contributes to the literature on sustainable business models and the New Space Economy, offering valuable implications for management practice and policy.

Among many reasons for this, the current study aims to dive into people’s cognitive abilities and explore the barriers located at the individual level, using an eye-tracking methodology. Previous findings indicate that a pro-environmental attitude does not necessarily lead to pro-environmental behavior. What may stand in the way is ignorance that can be mediated by other factors. This study will examine whether visual distraction from images depicting the impacts of climate change is mediated by mood regulation and environmental concern. This will help to fit educational and information materials to specific viewers, which may result in more pro-environmental behaviors in the future.

AB  - Circular economy is high on the political agenda, with governments at all levels setting ambitious goals to move away from traditional linear production models, where goods are used and disposed as waste, towards a future with less use of virgin raw materials, and where valuable materials at a product end-of-life are returned as raw materials or in an environmentally-friendly way to the biosphere. While circular economy is gaining a lot of attention on a policy level, the role that digital government can play to facilitate the circular economy transition is largely unexplored. We carry out a review of existing literature in the fields of digital government and Information Systems (IS) to identify the roles played by digital government in the circular economy. Based on an analysis of 54 empirical research articles, we identify foci and gaps in relation to the different types of roles played by government (nodality, authority, treasure, and organization), to stages of the Product Life Cycle (pre-use, in-use, and post-use), and to types of digital technology focused on. Based on these findings, we present an analytical framework to guide future research on digital government in relation to the circular economy, and exemplify the use of the framework drawing on examples from circular economy initiatives in the automotive industry.

AB  - The UK has set plans to increase offshore wind capacity from 22GW to 154GW by 2030. With such tremendous growth, the sector is now looking to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (RAI) in order to tackle lifecycle service barriers as to support sustainable and profitable offshore wind energy production. Today, RAI applications are predominately being used to support short term objectives in operation and maintenance. However, moving forward, RAI has the potential to play a critical role throughout the full lifecycle of offshore wind infrastructure, from surveying, planning, design, logistics, operational support, training and decommissioning. This paper presents one of the first systematic reviews of RAI for the offshore renewable energy sector. The state-of-the-art in RAI is analyzed with respect to offshore energy requirements, from both industry and academia, in terms of current and future requirements. Our review also includes a detailed evaluation of investment, regulation and skills development required to support the adoption of RAI. The key trends identified through a detailed analysis of patent and academic publication databases provide insights to barriers such as certification of autonomous platforms for safety compliance and reliability, the need for digital architectures for scalability in autonomous fleets, adaptive mission planning for resilient resident operations and optimization of human machine interaction for trusted partnerships between people and autonomous assistants. Our study concludes with identification of technological priorities and outlines their integration into a new ‘symbiotic digital architecture’ to deliver the future of offshore wind farm lifecycle management.

AB  - The global challenge of providing affordable and sustainable housing, particularly in Africa's intensified housing crisis, has spurred interest in transformative solutions such as 3D-printing technology. This research addresses a significant gap in understanding the technical and sustainability characteristics of 3D-printed housing, by comprehensively assessing a full-size 3D-printed house. Beyond examining building performance, a thorough life cycle assessment quantifies the whole life cycle carbon and cost, comparing the 3D-printed house with its conventional counterpart. The findings underscore the superior performance of 3D-printed housing in both technical and sustainability aspects. A 48 % reduction in the carbon footprint emphasizes the environmental sustainability of 3D-printed house. Despite a 70 % reduction in construction duration, the initial costs of technology and imported proprietary materials contribute to a higher life cycle cost for the 3D-printed house (381 %) in Africa. These results affirm the potential of 3D-printing as a sustainable and efficient mechanism for revolutionizing the African housing sector by improving performance and expediting delivery. The study provides valuable insights for housing stakeholders, advocating for the judicious use of 3D-printing and local bio-mediated geo-materials to address African housing crises, enhance residents' quality of life, and, consequently, sustain African cities and society.

AB  - The beginnings of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), led by Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), not only change the behaviour of digital media ecosystem users but also increase the energy consumption of enterprises working with GenAI, which presents them with a fundamental challenge in the era of climate change. This study aims to examine the relationships between the selected aspects of the use of GenAI tools and the environmental perception and behaviour of their users to understand the population's current environmental attitudes towards environmental risks and environmental sustainability. The survey was conducted in October 2024 on a sample of 1,268 respondents of the Czech Republic population. To process the data set, a logistic regression analysis, chi-squared test, Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion are employed. The results show that the more often people use GenAI tools, the more distant they consider the effects of climate change in time. The low frequency of use of ChatGPT may influence a higher willingness to change popular GenAI tools that are not maintained by environmentally friendly data centres. The frequency of ChatGPT use influences individuals’ perception of the importance of climate-change solving. The more frequently the respondents use artificial intelligence (AI) systems, they less perceive climate change as important. The low frequency of ChatGPT usage is associated with lower willingness to change email provider, transfer own data, leave social networks, stop using a favourite streaming platform and stop using a favourite GenAI platform. The respondents’ attitudes show a visible behavioural change. Internal personal motivation and self-confidence in learning, interest in career and self-confidence when using AI, the behavioural aspects, and the cognitive aspects are altered considerably. Based on the outcomes of the population survey, the study concludes that the issue of environmental friendliness of AI tools should become part of AI literacy that could strengthen population's willingness to use more energy-efficient GenAI platforms. The listed challenges are important in the perspective of the latest technological development, as shown by the discussion on the energy and computational demands of the GenAI platform DeepSeek, which is also discussed in the study.

AB  - Security is becoming an everyday concern for a wide range of electronic systems that manipulate, communicate, and store sensitive data. An important and emerging category of such electronic systems are battery-powered mobile appliances, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cell phones, which are severely constrained in the resources they possess, namely, processor, battery, and memory. This work focuses on one important constraint of such devices-battery life-and examines how it is impacted by the use of various security mechanisms. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis of the energy requirements of a wide range of cryptographic algorithms that form the building blocks of security mechanisms such as security protocols. We then study the energy consumption requirements of the most popular transport-layer security protocol: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). We investigate the impact of various parameters at the protocol level (such as cipher suites, authentication mechanisms, and transaction sizes, etc.) and the cryptographic algorithm level (cipher modes, strength) on the overall energy consumption for secure data transactions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the energy requirements of SSL. For our studies, we have developed a measurement-based experimental testbed that consists of an iPAQ PDA connected to a wireless local area network (LAN) and running Linux, a PC-based data acquisition system for real-time current measurement, the OpenSSL implementation of the SSL protocol, and parameterizable SSL client and server test programs. Based on our results, we also discuss various opportunities for realizing energy-efficient implementations of security protocols. We believe such investigations to be an important first step toward addressing the challenges of energy-efficient security for battery-constrained systems.

AB  - The number of devices connected to the Internet across the world is above eight billion according to IoT Analytics statistics. There has been a 56% increase after 2016 and is estimated to keep increasing in the subsequent years. Considering the expansive reach of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart homes, it has transformed how people interact with technology and has generated a debate on subjects such as integrity and privacy. Even though there are many reports reviewing the Amazon Echo dot (which is a device used to control smart home via verbal commands), a few of which have literature review supporting. This study aims to examine Echo Dot (second generation), one of Amazon's most popular IoT devices, by conducting a behavioural evaluation as well as a security and privacy analysis. Moreover, certain relevant security and privacy threats will be examined. Echo Dot's behaviour was analysed to ensure an effective analysis as per the network traffic rate (bandwidth), while its consumption of power was monitored over three days in various circumstances such as normal, silent, and noisy days. These behaviours were then compared to determine any abnormal behaviour. The study also subjected the device to two types of attacks which are sound-based attack and network-based attack. It was observed that the behaviour of the device in silent and normal modes was as per the expectations, whereas in a noisy environment, it consumed more power and had a higher number of transmitted packets compared to the average ideal mode. It should be noted that a major advantage of the Echo Dot is that the majority of the logic takes place on the Amazon cloud servers behind the scenes. The study's analysis showed that the device offers less satisfactory security and privacy. It is estimated that though sound-based attacks have potential, further understanding regarding the system's inner workings is necessary. It was found that the device persevered against the network-based attack and encrypted all packets, and thus, it was not easy to obtain information from them. Moreover, it was ensured that this study was scalable and could be implemented for other smart home or VAs IoT devices for identifying security or privacy issues.

AB  - Emerging technologies, such as delivery drones have enormous potential to revolutionize the rural healthcare supply chain (RHSC) and assist the countries in achieving sustainable development goal 3: good health and well-being. The advantages of delivery drones include faster delivery, high responsiveness, and a lack of dependence on road infrastructure. Given these advantages, prior literature on drone delivery has extensively explored their applicability in last-mile delivery from the e-commerce or retailer's perspective. However, their applicability in RHSC from an academic as well as practical perspective is still at a nascent stage. The present study fills this gap by examining the barriers inhibiting the adoption of delivery drones in RHSC using the Grey Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique. The results suggest that “lack of government regulations” is the most critical barrier. The study findings indicate that seven barriers are causal, and six are the effect barriers. “Limited load carrying capacity,” “low flight range,” and “difficulty in flying in adverse weather conditions” are the most prominent cause barriers. Moreover, “lack of skilled manpower,” “limited accuracy of navigation system,” and “lack of leadership commitment” are the most prominent effect barriers. We also perform sensitivity analysis to prove the robustness of the study output. The study results provide an in-depth understanding to the decision-makers and policymakers to help pave the way for the successful adoption of delivery drones in RHSC.

AB  - Water scarcity across the world and specifically in Saudi Arabia is exacerbated by climatic conditions such as desalinated resources, limited rainfall, reliance on ground water and arid climate. For addressing this issue, governments around the globe have implemented numerous measures leveraging advanced technology like AI and 5G for developed drought management systems. This paper aims to evaluate the synergies and conflicts of Saudi Arabi’s national policies with those of international standards (agreements, conventions and SDGs). The methodology of this paper is based on qualitative content analysis of Saudi Arabia’s policies (Mission 2030, National Innovation Plan and National Water Management Strategy 2030) with those of international agreements (Paris Agreement, UN Convention for combatting desertification & GPAI framework) and SDGs (6, 9, and 13). Python tools and libraries (pandas, nltk, sklearn, OpenPyXL and Networkx) are used for data processing, keyword extraction, themes identification, results extraction and their representation. The intersection of extracted themes has provided results that Mission 2030 and drought management strategy of KSA perfectly aligns with all the selected international agreements and SDGs. However, National Water Strategy 2030 merely aligns with UN Convention and SDG 6. On the other hand, National Innovation Plan of KSA overlaps with the themes of UN Convention, GPAI, SDG 13 and SDG 6 in a perfect manner. The analysis has shed clear light on the KSA’s policies alignment with international standards forecasting the Mission 2030 and drought management strategy in it. Even though the National Water Strategy aligns with merely two standards, it could be a limitation due to limited data set, thematic levels and keyword extraction instead of full text document analysis. Further research can benefit from additional data sources and full-text document reviews for better understanding of policy alignment and efficacy.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) continue to exhibit noteworthy capabilities across a spectrum of areas, including emerging proficiencies across the health care continuum. Successful LLM implementation and adoption depend on digital readiness, modern infrastructure, a trained workforce, privacy, and an ethical regulatory landscape. These factors can vary significantly across health care ecosystems, dictating the choice of a particular LLM implementation pathway. This perspective discusses 3 LLM implementation pathways—training from scratch pathway (TSP), fine-tuned pathway (FTP), and out-of-the-box pathway (OBP)—as potential onboarding points for health systems while facilitating equitable adoption. The choice of a particular pathway is governed by needs as well as affordability. Therefore, the risks, benefits, and economics of these pathways across 4 major cloud service providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle) are presented. While cost comparisons, such as on-demand and spot pricing across the cloud service providers for the 3 pathways, are presented for completeness, the usefulness of managed services and cloud enterprise tools is elucidated. Managed services can complement the traditional workforce and expertise, while enterprise tools, such as federated learning, can overcome sample size challenges when implementing LLMs using health care data. Of the 3 pathways, TSP is expected to be the most resource-intensive regarding infrastructure and workforce while providing maximum customization, enhanced transparency, and performance. Because TSP trains the LLM using enterprise health care data, it is expected to harness the digital signatures of the population served by the health care system with the potential to impact outcomes. The use of pretrained models in FTP is a limitation. It may impact its performance because the training data used in the pretrained model may have hidden bias and may not necessarily be health care–related. However, FTP provides a balance between customization, cost, and performance. While OBP can be rapidly deployed, it provides minimal customization and transparency without guaranteeing long-term availability. OBP may also present challenges in interfacing seamlessly with downstream applications in health care settings with variations in pricing and use over time. Lack of customization in OBP can significantly limit its ability to impact outcomes. Finally, potential applications of LLMs in health care, including conversational artificial intelligence, chatbots, summarization, and machine translation, are highlighted. While the 3 implementation pathways discussed in this perspective have the potential to facilitate equitable adoption and democratization of LLMs, transitions between them may be necessary as the needs of health systems evolve. Understanding the economics and trade-offs of these onboarding pathways can guide their strategic adoption and demonstrate value while impacting health care outcomes favorably.

AB  - Globally, wastewater management is a major issue. Using AI has improved treatment facility design and efficacy. AI techniques for wastewater treatment, such as pollutant identification, process optimization, and equipment maintenance, are often studied. In a standardized experimental setup, AI frameworks are not comprehensively evaluated. This study compares wastewater treatment AI paradigms to fill this gap. The evaluation includes accuracy, robustness, processing efficiency, and usability. Researchers hope to find the best AI methods for wastewater treatment tasks. Known methods like SVM, decision tree, ANN, Random Forest, and Deep Learning are examined. Each method is detailed to illuminate its principles. The comparison uses empirical data from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). ANN, LSTM, and SVM are more accurate and outperform with R values of 0.9958, 0.9939, and 0.9957. This study emphasizes the importance of tailoring AI methodologies to the needs and challenges of wastewater treatment. Researchers and practitioners can use the findings to choose AI strategies to optimize and manage wastewater treatment plants. This supports Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: Clean Water and Sanitation and global sustainability efforts.

AB  - The current work aims to analyze the main themes related to artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainable development during the pandemic period. This study provides an overview of the specialized literature related to AI and sustainability from the beginning of the pandemic through 2023. The present paper analyses scientific literature emphasizing both artificial intelligence's positive and negative impacts on sustainable development objectives (SDGs). To conduct the research, we employed bibliometric analysis and text-mining techniques to identify the major themes in the literature indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Firstly, we used descriptive measures to identify the authors' impact, the article production by country, the main keywords used, and other descriptive data. We further used data reduction methods based on co-word analysis (such as multiple correspondence analysis) on authors' keywords to show patterns in the themes explored in the literature. Bibliometric analysis was supplemented by text mining using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and structural topic modeling on abstracts to provide a comprehensive view of scientific debates on AI and sustainable development. Our research has identified various themes in the literature related to AI and sustainable development. These themes include social sustainability, health-related issues, AI technologies for energy efficiency, sustainability in industry and innovation, IoT technologies for smart and sustainable cities, urban planning, technologies for education and knowledge production, and the impact of technologies on SDGs. We also found that there is a significant positivity bias in the literature when discussing the impact of AI on sustainable development. Despite acknowledging certain risks, the literature tends to focus on the potential benefits of AI across various sectors. In addition, the analysis shows a growing emphasis on energy efficiency, which is facilitated by the use of AI technologies. Our study contributes to a better understanding of current scholarly discussion trends and emerging scientific avenues regarding AI and sustainable development. It also highlights the areas where research is needed and the implications for practitioners and policymakers.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in simulating public opinions on social issues. These models can be leveraged in educational simulations that allow students to acquire information and feedback from multiple perspectives. In this research, we investigate the potential of using LLMs (specifically GPT-4) to generate open-ended responses about climate change within a science communication simulation. We prompt GPT-4 to role-play as different personas with various demographics (race/ethnicity, gender, age, income, political affiliations, and ability status) and levels of concern about climate change. We find that GPT-4 is capable of representing multifaceted perspectives around climate change's impact and solutions. However, the model may exaggerate narratives for certain personas based on political affiliations, gender, and concern levels. Such exaggeration may lead to homogeneous narratives that do not fully represent the simulated personas. Our findings highlight the affordances and challenges of applying LLMs to simulating public opinions and enriching educational experiences.

AB  - In the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), countries are encouraged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. With the rapid technological advancement in the area of home automation and the ever-increasing consumption of energy, it is necessary to adopt smart control systems that help to reduce the cost and emission of greenhouse gases. This work aims to reduce the amount of energy consumption by implementing a customized design of a voice-controlled hardware/software embedded platform. The prototype utilizes an Android mobile application in addition to a software-controlled On/Off switch that controls home appliances. The proposed prototype is cost-effective, power efficient, and user-friendly. An Android-based mobile application also facilitates its usability by controlling home appliances using voice-activated commands. This work demonstrates a fully functional small-scale prototype using Arduino IDE which could easily be scaled up to an industrial scale as an IoT (Internet of Things) device. The energy efficiency of the hardware platform is solely dependent on the Arduino board that acts as a hub between all the electrical appliances and the Firebase mobile application. To optimize the energy consumption of the utilized hardware, different energy-efficient modes are implemented and results are reported.

To lessen detrimental effects on the environment and public health, ewaste needs to be treated appropriately. This study reveals how computer and electronic trash can be managed utilizing the 5IR. A literature review was conducted in order to get more knowledge about the potentially hazardous components of e-waste and their effects, the financial advantages of recycling e-waste, and international best practices for efficient e-waste management and forecasting. The results show that a complementary strategy is needed for the best potential e-waste management outcomes. Both technological and policy initiatives should be a part of this strategy. Developing innovative technologies for recycling e-waste and enhancing the current recycling infrastructure are examples of technical measures. Policy initiatives include things like putting laws into place to ensure that e-waste is disposed of securely and supporting public awareness campaigns to educate people about the importance of recycling e-waste. In order to guarantee efficient monitoring and sustainable development, this paper highlights the significance of formal gathering and documentation. E-waste management initiatives can be evaluated for efficacy and the flow of e-waste can be tracked with the aid of formal collection and recording systems. In order to overcome the difficulties associated with managing electronic trash, it was finally resolved by stressing the significance of cooperation between business, government, and civil society. By managing electronic waste sustainably and effectively, we can create a more equitable and sustainable future for everybody.

AB  - International and transnational cooperation is needed to strengthen environmental governance initiatives with advanced technologies. In January 2023, Ontario Tech University hosted a symposium entitled Tech With a Green Governance Conscience: Exploring the Technology–Environmental Policy Nexus. Attendees spanned diverse disciplines, sectors, and countries, bringing unique and diverse perspectives to the technology–environmental policy nexus. Emergent themes arising from the symposium include the role of artificial intelligence in environmental governance, while eliminating the detrimental social impacts associated with these advanced technologies via algorithmic bias, misunderstanding, and unaccountability. The symposium explored the tech–society–ecology interface, such as the authoritarian intensification of digitalized environmental governance, “technocracy”, and the ethical implications of sacrificing democratic legitimacy in the face of imminent environmental destruction. Select participants (i.e., co-authors) at the symposium provided input on a preliminary framework, which led to this perspective article focused on the politics surrounding green governance in the 21st century. We conclude that while emerging technologies are being deployed to address grand environmental challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion, the use of these various technologies for progressive environmental policy development and enforcement requires co-productivist approaches to constructive technology assessments and embracing the concept of technologies of humility. This necessitates a space for dialogue, reflection, and deliberation on leading adaptive environmental governance in the face of power and politics, as we interrogate the putative neutrality of advanced technology and techno-solutionism.

AB  - Due to demand for ubiquitous cloud computing services, the number and scale of data centers has been increasing exponentially leading to huge consumption of electricity and water. Moreover, data centers in demand response programs can make the power grid more stable and sustainable. We study the power management in data centers from perspectives of economic, sustainability, and efficiency. From economic perspective, we focus on cost minimization or budgeting of data centers. From sustainability point of view, we look at water and carbon footprint in addition to energy consumption. Finally, we study demand response between data centers and utilities to manage the power grid efficiently.

AB  - Achieving sustainability has become a global priority, with environmental sustainability gaining significant attention from policymakers due to its critical importance. While numerous studies have empirically examined the relationship between CO2 emissions and green initiatives, they often overlook sectoral differences. Since different sectors contribute unequally to carbon emissions, the environmental effectiveness of green solutions may vary across sectors. This study addresses this research gap by focusing on the transport sector, a major contributor to global CO2 emissions. This study investigates the role of green technology, green energy, green finance, digital economy, economic growth, and urbanization on transport sector CO2 emissions in G-20 economies from 2002 to 2022. Using panel quantile regression, the results reveal that green energy and economic growth reduce transport emissions in lower quantiles; while green energy, green finance, and urbanization enhance environmental quality in upper quantiles. However, green technology is associated with higher transport emissions across all quantiles. Moreover, we employ a simple regression tree model, a machine learning approach, to identify which countries are winners and losers in terms of predicted transport emissions. Our results predict a 13.72 % increase in transport emissions across G-20 nations, with Japan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Argentina, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, France, Brazil, India, and Italy among the most affected. These findings recommends shifting to non-motorized vehicles and public transportation systems that enhance transport efficiency and mitigate environmental degradation through green transportation.

AB  - In the past decades, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been applied in a large number of engineering fields along with advanced communication and computing technologies. The smart grid is one of these fields that widely uses AI-based solutions to optimize complicated energy grids with the integration of distributed energy resources and improve overall system performance in terms of efficiency, reliability, and stability. However, researchers have tended to use eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) due to the lack of transparency of AI models and the request for more understandable models, especially for critical research areas. This chapter provides a brief review of the major smart grid applications using XAI (i.e., forecasting, electric vehicle, energy management, etc.). It also examines the main contributions of XAI to studies in smart grid applications.

AB  - India is marching towards achieving a desirable status of a developed country with rapid strides. Ensuring uninterrupted supply of energy to support economic and commercial activities is essential for sustainable economic growth. In true sense, sustainable development should be widely spread in all three dimensions - social, economic, and environmental. For all these areas, energy is perhaps the most important aspect. The production and the consumption patterns at the local and the global scale, determine not only all the activities in society, but also some major environmental issues like pollution, green house effect, and desertification. This paper presents the scenario of power generation, consumption and forecasts power requirements up to 13th five year plan. While it also stressing on energy and its close linkages with environment, poverty and sustainability. This also describes the strategies to meet the necessary demand of power and steps taken to achieve sustainability.

AB  - The global construction business is on a point of a paradigm shift. The exponential growth of digital technologies, the increasing impacts of climate change, impending Brexit and looming social and environmental pressures are driving change to the construction industry. Increasingly policies press for the adoption of sustainability and construction organisations are realising that small sustainable impacts are no longer enough. Therefore, measurement is one of the keys to the implementation of sustainable construction strategies. Advances in data gathering, computing power and connectivity mean that construction organisations have more information and data than ever before. Collecting, analysing and understanding those large volumes of available data, known as Big Data, about how an organisation operates sustainably leads to knowledge that can improve decision making, refine goals and focus efforts. However, when it comes to sustainability the great thing about big data is that it is unlocking the ability of businesses to understand and act on what is typically their biggest sustainable (i.e. economic, social and environmental) impacts - the ones outside their control. Measuring and understanding how doing business really does affect the natural world will open new opportunities for bringing sustainability inside an organisation: creating change, cutting costs and boosting long-term profitability in a resource-constrained world. Still, there are issues and challenges around gathering sustainability-related data, as well as in analysing and interpreting of data points. Therefore, the aim of this research is to explore the barriers to adopting big data related to sustainable strategies. The relationship between Policy Making, Big Data and sustainability is still in early stages, but already several applications can be mention to the environment, health and construction, such as biodiversity loss monitoring, pollution zones Identification, endangered species location, smart energy management, cost reduction or investment assessment. In the same way, barriers and opportunities were identified, for instance: the lack of financial resources and business case, skills and training, unequal opportunity and security and disclosure issues among the barriers, and partnership, emerging and accessible technology, personalization of the environment among the opportunities. Finally, the biggest challenge presented by the implementation of Big Data is concept standardization, since there are many areas in which one way or another is making use of this technology without being recognized as such. In the same way, the greatest asset that represents the use of Big Data for sustainability is the identification of the future causes and consequences of climate change and its subsequent prevention or mitigation in time.

AB  - Climate change will affect all types of infrastructure, including energy system. Rising temperatures, increased flood risk and other potential hazards will threaten the reliable and efficient energy supply with potentially large economic and social impacts. To strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards for the Italian electric sector, several adaptation and mitigation actions are to be implemented. In order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts and vulnerabilities, some updated climate change scenarios have been elaborated over Italy on the basis of high-resolution climate models provided by the EU-funded Project Euro-CORDEX with horizontal resolution of 0.11°(~ 12 km) under the Representative Concentration Pathway RCP 8.5. The climate change scenarios have been characterized at seasonal scale, by comparing the current climate (1971–2000) with projections at short (FUT1=2021-2050), medium (2041–2070) and long (FUT2=2071-2100) terms. Without mitigation actions, the more significant results highlight a warming of about 2°C in the next decades, 3°C in the mid of the century, and more than 5°C in the last thirty-years period. Moreover a precipitation decrease is expected, with significant reduction in the summer ranging in between 10 and 20 % in the first half of the century, until 50 % at the end of it. Hot days and coastal floods show the most dramatic rise, but the risks of inland flooding will depend on both the season and the Italian region. Wet-snow events are projected to decrease considerably in the areas nowadays affected by these phenomena, whereas they are likely to increase significantly over Alps, kept free of wet-snow until now. Larger uncertainties characterize the Central and Northern Apennines where the signal is almost absent and no useful information can be inferred for these areas.

This paper proposes an efficient and privacy-friendly hop-by-hop data aggregation scheme and a billing solution for smart grid systems. In our approach, hop-by-hop communication is utilized for transmitting usage reports of the smart meters. From the outcome of the security and performance analyses we can argue that our proposed scheme is secure and computationally more efficient, as compared to the other solutions.

AB  - the revolution caused by the advanced analysis features of Internet of Things and big data have made a big turnaround in the digital world. Data analysis is not only limited to collect useful data but also useful in analyzing information quickly. Therefore, most of the variants of the shared system based on the parallel structural model are explored simultaneously as the appropriate big data storage library stimulates researchers’ interest in the distributed system. Due to the emerging digital technologies, different groups such as healthcare facilities, financial institutions, e-commerce, food service and supply chain management generate a surprising amount of information. Although the process of statistical analysis is essential, it can cause significant security and privacy issues. Therefore, the analysis of data privacy protection is very important. Using the platform, technology should focus on providing Advanced Cryptography Policy (ACP). This research explores different security risks, evolutionary mechanisms and risks of privacy protection. It further recommends the post-statistical modern privacy protection act to manage data privacy protection in binary format, because it is kept confidential by the user. The user authentication program has already filed access restrictions. To maintain this purpose, everyone’s attitude is to achieve a changing identity. This article is designed to protect the privacy of users and propose a new system of restoration of controls.

AB  - The continuous growth of data centers prompts research into their energy impact. While some cloud providers give an overall estimate of data centers energy efficiency, there is a lack of transparency about data for individual components and functions. We explore metrics to evaluate the energy efficiency of cloud data storage in particular and represent them as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for organizational monitoring. To this aim, we perform an exploratory study with Schuberg Philis (SBP), a leading IT provider in the Netherlands to explore sustainability monitoring for cloud data storage. We identify the data provided by a cloud provider and explore the corresponding metrics in the academic literature. Based on the SBP's sustainability roadmap, we propose three KPIs that are developed using an existing KPI framework. These KPIs are reviewed by the experts at SBP for their correctness and added value. The study provides, (i) an overview of the energy efficiency of cloud data storage, (ii) suggested KPIs to monitor and optimize the cloud data storage to meet the SBP's sustainability goals. The KPIs are energy consumption (kW/h), storage capacity utilization (%), and capacity per watt (GB/Watt), and (iii) actions per KPI to reach the sustainability targets. The results of the study provide insights into monitoring the energy efficiency of data storage for SBP for potential optimization while building a foundation for developing similar approaches for other practitioners and for targeting sustainability concerns.

AB  - Agri-Photovoltaic (A-PV) system in India enhances the agricultural sector's resilience to climate change by balancing energy generation and food production. This is accomplished by bringing the temperature of the air close to the solar panels down. There is a payback period of 1.73 for the system, and the land equivalent ratio is 9.49 with this system. Enhanced interactions between land, food, and energy are among the key advantages. Other advantages include dynamic system adaptability, fewer land-use disputes, enhanced crop rotation, and improved livelihood development. However, in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals for medium and large-scale audiovisual system installations, additional study is required. According to the results of performance studies, Support Vector Machine (SVM) models performed better than Decision Tree (DT) models. The R2 /RMSE/MAE values for SVM models are 0.9398, 0.643994, and 2.34 respectively.

AB  - Climate sustainability plays a very crucial role in environmental sustainability and by considerable use of natural resources, and reducing pollution, we can make our planet beautiful and sustaining for the life of future generations. Climate changes constitute increasingly severe challenges, and with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the necessity for innovation in fostering climate sustainability has become increasingly evident. This review organizes an exhaustive inventory of which AI affects climate science. The challenges remain unmet in AI's various applications across sectors such as optimization of renewable energy, climate modeling, disaster resilience and environmental monitoring. This paper discusses the important roles of applying AI in overcoming climate change difficulties. These include energy management or conservation, cap-and-trade for carbon emissions, climate and weather forecasting, grid management, transportation, and agriculture infrastructure, or city planning. It also looks into how and the extent to which AI is adopted in resource management, increasing the adoption of renewable energy, fostering sustainable development, and overseeing resources such as water and forests. This study acknowledges various barriers that impede the effective application of Artificial Intelligence in combating climate change which include data restrictions, algorithms' bias, and ethical issues with AI operations. To solve the major challenges described, we improve the major findings of this extensive literature review and distill a set of practical recommendations for policy-makers, industrial actors and researchers. Which will in return assist in overcoming challenges and enhance the capacity of AI in combating climate change and environmental conservation.

AB  - In today's digital transformation era, the importance of developing dynamic capabilities has significantly increased. However, the literature has not fully explored the significance of dynamic capabilities in sustainable development. Hence, in this article, we examine the impact of digital capabilities (DCs) and operational transparency (OT) on achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Drawing upon the dynamic capability view (DCV), we analyze the impact of DC on decent work conditions (DWCs), reduced inequalities (RIs), responsible consumption and production (RCP), and reduced carbon footprint (RCF) through the mediating effect of OT. We conduct 14 semistructured interviews to understand how developing dynamic capabilities can drive organizations toward achieving SDGs. Subsequently, we apply a cross-sectional survey to gather data from 257 respondents in the Bangladeshi ready-made garments industry. We use the variance-based structural equation modeling technique to test our research hypotheses. Our findings suggest that DC significantly enhances OT and that OT can positively impact DWC, RI, RCP, and RCF. Additionally, we find that OT partially mediates the link between DC and SDGs. Our study provides valuable insights into the DCV, offering a better theoretical understanding of the role of DC in enhancing OT to achieve SDGs. It can also encourage firms to take advantage of emerging digital technologies and the trend toward digitalization by demonstrating a strong commitment to adopting new advanced technologies, developing dynamic capabilities, and striving to achieve SDGs.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive performance over a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, demonstrating potential in the realms of understanding human language with great precision. In this paper, we compare a number of state-of-the-art LLMs and Prompts on how well they achieve in an application-specific task to identify Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from textual content. Our evaluation of these models is built around essential BERTScore metrics. Our results provide a more nuanced perspective of the advantages and weaknesses in each model’s presentation, uncovering their appropriateness for SDG identification tasks as well as implications for wider deployment across other NLP based applications. Our results show that GPT-4.0 stands out as the best performing model for identifying Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from textual content, achieving the highest precision, recall, and F1-Score across various datasets. Moreover, the Few-Shot prompting technique emerged as the most effective method for guiding the model’s responses. By providing GPT-4.0 with a few carefully selected examples, Few-Shot prompting significantly enhances its ability to accurately map text to relevant SDGs, making it the optimal choice for this task.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) bring convenience to public transport while having the potential to increase energy efficiency. With the rapid growth of the number of EVs, cross-domain charging will become a strong demand. Despite massive research on EV charging, existing schemes can hardly meet the security requirements of privacy protection and access control for cross-domain scenarios. Meanwhile, centralized methods bring the single point of failure and data modification. The problem of designing a secure cross-domain EV charging scheme to simultaneously ensure decentralization, privacy and access control has not been studied and remains open. Therefore, in this paper, we design BlockPPA, the first blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving authentication scheme for cross-domain EV charging in order to achieve this purpose. Our scheme makes each EV obtain an attribute-based secret key, which is used to authenticate itself and also anonymously illustrate that it really satisfies a designated access policy when cross-domain authentication happens. Only authorized EVs satisfying the policy do they have the ability to charge. We design three smart contracts and exploit Fabric blockchain to record the domain's detailed information and the authentication record of each cross-domain access from an EV, while achieving the decentralized verification of an authentication request. The results of security and performance analysis show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed cross-domain authentication mechanism.

AB  - According to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the built environment contributes around 10 % of global GDP but is also a major source of emissions, land use, and resource consumption. The built environment also consumes one-third of global energy and produces 40 % of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The United Nations has set up the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which emphasize the significance of transforming the built environment to cope with issues such as net-zero emissions, resilient infrastructure, circular economy, health, etc. Researchers have emphasized that digitalization is one of the factors that can meet the aforementioned targets in a built environment with a sustainability aspect. Digitalization in any field is realized with the assimilation of Industry 4.0 enabling technologies with sustainably built infrastructure. It has been identified that; there are limited studies where all Industry 4.0 enabling technologies are detailed discussed. Based upon the above facts, this study aims to analyze and identify the progress of distinct Industry 4.0 enabling technologies including the Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Edge Computing/Fog Computing, Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Blockchain, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), Digital Twin, Metaverse, and Robotics implementation in the built environment. Along with this, the study also discusses challenges and suggests recommendations for future work.

AB  - Global warming has caused significant negative consequences for developing countries like India. The carbon market was considered as an effective solution for curbing Green House Gases (GHG) emissions, which is considered as the primary reason for global warming. Carbon market was established in the Kyoto protocol among developed economies and later extended to developing economies through the Paris Agreement. The international carbon market did not return satisfactory results. However, the Chinese domestic carbon market returned good results motivating the Indian government to create a strategy, policy, and plan for the Indian domestic carbon market. Through a strategic conceptual framework, this research has tried to establish a hypothetical theory that success of carbon market in the supply chain of India would require data-driven approach to measuring and curbing GHG emissions caused by the polluting entities. Data-driven approach helps in policy making and actions based on actual measurements instead of speculations. The strategic conceptual framework shows interfacing between the domains of Indian carbon credits policy and the data-driven approach through two government-sponsored and controlled systems: a market exchange and a blockchain. Other components proposed are an accounting system of carbon credits on big data systems and entity-specific cloud-hosted data systems supported by Artificial Intelligence. This research proposed that carbon credits should not be traded as an alternative to implementing technologies and innovations for GHG emissions, and should not have expiry dates. The model may perform better than the European model as it is based on the top-down approach (based on China), adopts Industry 4.0 technologies, active measurements and accounting, smart contracts, and data-driven enforcements. The practical implications of the model may be higher involvement of manufacturing entities in curbing GHG emissions with government-controlled governance of their carbon credits trading and holding, their technical innovation capabilities, and their compliances.

AB  - This review paper delved into the economic and environmental benefits of Digital Agricultural Technological Solutions (DATSs) in livestock farming systems. Synthesising data from 52 peer-reviewed papers it presents the outcomes of a systematic literature review on livestock farming DATSs, conducted with the use of the PRISMA methodology. The analysis highlighted the contribution of DATSs across three main livestock farming DATSs categories: Automated Milking Systems (AMS), Feed and Live Weight Measurement technologies, and Health Monitoring Systems. The results showed that AMS has the potential to boost cow productivity by up to 15 % while also reducing energy consumption by 35 %. Feed and Live Weight Measurement technologies contribute notably to sustainability and cost savings, with feed waste reductions of 75 % and feeding savings of 33 %. Health Monitoring Systems are especially effective in improving herd health and productivity through early detection of clinical issues, which directly enhances animal welfare and farm efficiency. Environmentally, AMS and health monitoring tools play a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with AMS lowering global warming potential by up to 5.83 %. Overall, the findings of this review highlight the potentials of livestock DATSs towards economic viability and environmental sustainability, suggesting that the wider adoption could offer substantial benefits for the livestock farming sector. Up to now, DATSs have shown great potential in dairy cattle by improving milk yield, quality, and animal health, with advancements such as AMS increasing productivity and health monitoring systems enhancing early disease detection. In contrast, their application in sheep, goats, and pigs is still in its early stages, mainly limited to basic health monitoring and feeding technologies, despite the economic importance of these species, especially in the Mediterranean area, where most of the studies are conducted.

AB  - Summary We highlight the critical role of data in developing sustainable combustion technologies for industries requiring high-density and localized energy sources. Combustion systems are complex and difficult to predict, and high-fidelity simulations are out of reach for practical systems because of computational cost. Data-driven approaches and artificial intelligence offer promising solutions, enabling renewable synthetic fuels to meet decarbonization goals. We discuss open challenges associated with the availability and fidelity of data, physics-based numerical simulations, and machine learning, focusing on developing digital twins capable of mirroring the behavior of industrial combustion systems and continuously updating based on newly available information.

AB  - Agriculture faces a major challenge in meeting the world’s growing demand for food in a sustainable manner in the face of increasing environmental pressures, in particular the growing impact of climate change. Agriculture is also a major contributor to climate change. Digital technologies in agriculture can contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation. This paper examines the interactions between climate change and agriculture, reviews adaptation and mitigation strategies, explores the application of digital technologies in this context, and discusses future challenges and opportunities for sustainable and resilient agriculture. The final aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state and future prospects of digital agriculture in the context of climate change. A comprehensive literature review was conducted on adaptation and mitigation strategies in agriculture, and on the current state and future prospects of digital agriculture in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation. The identified applications of digital technologies in agriculture include Remote Sensing for crop monitoring, Big Data for predictive modelling of water shortages and pest outbreaks, Artificial Intelligence for pest identification and tracking, the Internet of Things for precision fertiliser management, nanotechnology for soil improvement, robots for targeted spraying, and blockchain for improved soil management and supply chain transparency, among others. These technologies facilitate the precise management of resources, improve decision-making processes and enable more efficient agricultural practices. Digital technologies also help mitigate climate change by optimising inputs such as water and fertiliser, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting carbon sequestration. However, there are significant barriers to the adoption of these technologies, including the digital divide, high up-front costs and complexity, as well as privacy and security concerns and the environmental impact of technology use. Future action must address these barriers by investing in infrastructure and training, ensuring financial incentives, developing scalable digital solutions tailored to local agricultural conditions, increasing digital literacy among farmers, developing comprehensive governance frameworks, and exploring the integration of multiple digital technologies. The paper contributes to advancing scientific understanding and guiding practice and policy towards sustainable agriculture in the face of climate change. It provides a call to action for a more sustainable future in the context of climate change and highlights the urgency of multi-stakeholder collaboration to create an enabling environment for the widespread adoption of these innovations, ensuring that they are accessible, cost-effective and suitable for different farming environments.

AB  - This article provides a comprehensive overview of digital technologies for water use and management in agriculture, examining recent applications and future prospects. It examines key water-related challenges - scarcity, pollution, inefficient use and climate change - and shows how various digital technologies such as Remote Sensing, Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Big Data, Robotics, Smart Sensors and Blockchain can help address them. The review finds that these technologies offer significant potential for improving water management practices, with Remote Sensing and Artificial Intelligence emerging as the most versatile and widely adopted. Efficient irrigation strategies appear to be the most common application across technologies. Digital solutions significantly reduce water wastage, help identify pollution hotspots, and improve overall water resource management. For example, remote sensing-based approaches (e.g. UAV-mounted multispectral cameras) can accurately monitor soil moisture to optimise irrigation scheduling, while AI-driven models (e.g. random forest or neural networks) can predict groundwater recharge or forecast rainfall events. However, several barriers to widespread adoption are identified, including high implementation costs, lack of technical expertise, data management challenges, and infrastructure and connectivity constraints. The study concludes by suggesting priorities for future research and development, highlighting the need for integrated technological solutions, improved accessibility and affordability, improved efficiency and sustainability, improved water quality, enhanced data management capabilities, and strategies to address emerging concerns such as cybersecurity and the environmental impact of digital technologies themselves. This review aims to inform future research, policy and practice in agricultural water management and support the development of more productive, resilient and sustainable agricultural systems.

AB  - As the world of manufacturing is accelerating to its digital paradigm, it could become a significant generator of energy-consuming data. The storage of such data is facilitated by the proliferation of easily accessible cloud services, whilst the cost of transmission and storage has significantly dropped. Within a sustainability context, the carbon-footprint characteristics of these masses of data-capture, transmission, storage and management have not been given adequate due-diligence. A cause of this omission may be the assumption that renewable forms of energy generation and storage, may eventually render the big cloud data-centers carbon neutral. However, such assumptions may be pre-mature and not synchronized with unfolding realities, as the carbon footprint implications of the industry 4.0 discourse have not been assessed. This paper ascertains the absence of any structured assessment framework of CO2 emissions of the various components of industrial digitalization, as an evaluation tool of the accelerating digital transformation of manufacturing within a sustainable growth context.

AB  - This article explores the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), leading to decarbonization, in disadvantaged communities (DACs) by applying statistical and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to understand the factors associated with AFV adoption in these communities. The study harnesses a unique and comprehensive database of surveys and public databases for the Puget Sound region in the United States. The XAI techniques, specifically the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm with Shapely Additive Explanations, provide interpretable and understandable explanations of factors associated with AFV adoption in DACs. The study findings provide an understanding of the social and economic factors and challenges of DACs. The results suggest several key factors, especially a lack of access to charging infrastructure, consumer attitudes, and income, play a substantial role in adopting AFVs. As expected, AFV adoption in DACs (12.96%) is lower than non-DACs (15.30%). More public charging stations strongly correlate with AFV adoption in DACs. Tech-oriented households in DACs are more likely to adopt AFVs compared with non-DACs. The findings also point to the significant effects of home charging facilities while adopting AFVs in DACs. The XAI results emphasize the importance of socio-economic factors in AFV adoption programs and provide insights into decision-making in DACs. This research contributes to the literature on AFV adoption and suggests opportunities for improvements in DACs transitioning to AFVs. The study findings can be used to assess the planning-level impacts of refueling or charging infrastructure in DACs while enabling DACs to benefit from infrastructure investments.

AB  - Leveraging on-site renewable sources like solar and wind provides ample opportunities on developing environmental friendly and energy-efficient data centers. Due to intermittent nature of renewable energy and fluctuating grid energy price, advanced data centers often deploy distributed UPS systems with high efficiency, scalability, and reliability. In this study, we investigate the problem of energy management for data centers with renewable resources and energy storages. We propose an interface-backbone layer framework designed unified energy efficiency management system called REDUX, which properly allocate fluctuating renewable energy, UPS battery energy storage or grid power with dynamic price aiming to minimize the long-term electricity bill for the data center. With prediction of renewable energy supply, categorization of grid power price level and energy storage in the UPS devices, REDUX orchestrates workload distribution with heuristic algorithms which act as renewable energy smoothing, UPS device control, and high level control strategies, and make back-fills or defer decisions for the non-urgent jobs. Compared with the existing strategies, REDUX provides a comprehensive view for the energy efficiency data center and demonstrates a prominent capability of mitigating average peak workload and boosting renewable-energy utilization.

AB  - Data centres (DCs) are expected to satisfy the rising demand for internet services. Denmark alone is expected to host several large-scale DCs, whose demand for electricity in 2040 may reach 33% of 2017 national electricity consumption. Understanding the operation and interactions of DCs with energy systems is key to understanding their impacts on installed capacities, costs and emissions. The present paper makes three contributions in this regard. First, we introduce a thermodynamic model that relates the power consumption of DCs to their production of excess heat (EH). Second, the results are scaled up to represent DCs in a national energy-system model for the analysis of different scenarios. Third, scenarios are generated and analysed to quantify the impact of DCs on the Danish energy system until 2050. The results show that DCs might have significant impacts on Denmark’s power and district heating (DH) sectors. First, the power demand from DCs translates into an additional 3–6 GW of offshore wind capacity. Second, EH from DCs is beneficial to the whole energy system, the entire quantity of EH being utilized in four out of five scenarios. EH recovery from DCs is economically beneficial, providing from 4% to 27% of Denmark’s DH after 2040.

AB  - In the digital transformation era, and particularly in Industry 5.0, humans play an active role in industrial cyber–physical systems (CPS) since they are the most flexible piece in such automated systems. However, their integration is not easy and constitutes a relevant challenge, presenting different requirements according to the activities they execute and the related integration levels, i.e., Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) and Human-in-the-Mesh (HitM). Besides the use of human-centric design approaches, the use of digital technologies, namely Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, virtual and augmented reality and collaborative robotics, can contribute to empower humans to perform their operations in a faster and more efficient manner. This paper discusses how emergent digital technologies can enhance a more symbiotic integration of humans in industrial CPS, contributing with the analysis of different aspects and concerns that must be considered to properly enable the HitL and HitM integration levels in CPS. Four experimental case studies are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of using digital technologies to enhance the human-CPS integration, covering HitL and HitM levels. Furthermore, some challenges related to the human-integration factors affected by the digital technologies in such environments are briefly discussed and pointed out as research directions.

AB  - The circular economy (CE) is a key component in achieving SDG-12. A number of features could greatly enhance and quicken the circular economy. Artificial intelligence (AI) and eco-investment are two of the most important ones. The primary objective of this article is to assess the impact of artificial intelligence and eco-investment on the development of circular economy in the context of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) - 12. The authors designed a panel regression model to ascertain the influence on CE. In this model, CE is the dependent variable, whereas AI and eco-investment are the independent variables. Over a ten-year period, data and information from 27 EU member states were employed in the modelling. The strong results demonstrate that, albeit having a lesser impact than eco-investment, AI has a substantial impact on CE. The model created exhibits flexibility that permits the estimation of distinct equations for any country under consideration. One crucial finding is that there are slow processes that may take many years to complete in order to meet deadlines and require a substantial sum of money. One more point of attention is the replacement that occurs between the two independent variables. Up to a certain point, it is feasible to replace one variable with another while accounting for unique features of every country. The paper highlights the significance of AI and how it can help us get closer to SDG-12 and accelerate the CE.

AB  - The circular economy (CE) is essential to achieving a sustainable future through resource conservation and climate protection. Efficient use of materials and products over time is a critical aspect of CE, helping to reduce CO2 emissions, waste and resource consumption. The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is a CE-specific approach that contains information about components and their origin, and can also provide environmental and social impact assessments. However, creating a DPP requires collecting and analyzing data from many different stakeholders along the supply chain and even throughout the product lifecycle. In this paper, we present a concept for the SPACE_DS, which is a data space for circular economy data. A key point here is that the SPACE_DS enables the creation of DPPs by especially considering privacy and security concerns of data providers.

Efforts to improve productivity, especially for strategic minerals, have accelerated with automation and artificial intelligence (AI). However, the rapid growth of this industry has raised concerns among researchers regarding sustainable development. This chapter examines the impact of AI in mines on sustainable development, considering social, economic, and environmental factors. Studies show that AI can positively affect environmental sustainability by reducing negative impacts and monitoring pollution. Yet, the significant initial capital required for infrastructure may challenge economic sustainability, though justifying this cost can enhance long-term economic viability. AI may increase knowledge and create new jobs while simultaneously reducing employment opportunities for manual laborers. Further comprehensive studies are necessary to establish frameworks ensuring that the use of AI aligns with sustainable development goals across all indicators.

AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive examination of the effects of digital technology on residential and non-residential CO2 emissions in 277 Chinese cities from 2010 to 2019. The study estimates energy-based carbon emissions (calculated by bottom-up approach) and net carbon emissions (calculated by top-down approach) simultaneously, offering a holistic view. Mediating, moderation, and threshold regression models are employed to uncover the influencing mechanisms. The findings, which have practical implications, reveal that digital technology has a dual effect: it promotes residential CO2 emissions but inhibits non-residential CO2 emissions. This effect is consistent for both energy-based and net carbon emissions. The overall correlation with energy-based carbon emissions is negative, while the relationship between digital technology and total net CO2 emissions is weakly positive. Specifically, digital technology intensifies residential CO2 emissions by influencing individuals’ behaviors such as consumption, employment, and education. It also indirectly affects non-residential CO2 emissions by promoting economic growth, influencing economic structure, and promoting foreign investment. In detail, the study verifies the inverted U-shape relationship between economic growth and carbon emission and the pollution halo hypothesis. This study not only contributes to calculating an innovative digital technology index (DTI) and net CO2 emissions but also inspires policy suggestions for technology development and environmental regulation through mechanism analysis.

AB  - Frugal innovation, also known as frugal engineering or innovation, is an approach to product development and problem-solving that focuses on creating simple, affordable, and effective solutions. The research on frugal innovation is evolving which is mainly rooted in the challenges faced by people living in developing countries, where resource constraints and limited access to technology, infrastructure, and capital make it difficult to adopt traditional expensive and complex solutions. This study attempts to explore the impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools on frugal innovation from the perspective of China, a developing nation. Moreover, how entrepreneurial knowledge can play a moderating role among the nexus of frugal innovation, IoT, and AI is a key question of this study. This study spotlights the proposed inquiry based on seven hundred and seventy-nine responses as analyzed using SEM approach by SmartPLS. This study affirmed that IoT and AI both are valid predictors of frugal innovation therefore management should incorporate both capabilities to achieve frugal innovation and to win over competitors in today's technological-oriented era. This study highlights that acceptance of technology is imperative where entrepreneurial skills can play a significant role in incorporating innovative technologies like IoT and AI models into practices. This study also enlists several managerial implications along with limitations and future research possibilities for worldly scholars.

AB  - Despite impressive results, deep learning-based technologies also raise severe privacy and environmental concerns induced by the training procedure often conducted in data centers. In response, alternatives to centralized training such as Federated Learning (FL) have emerged. FL is now starting to be deployed at a global scale by companies that must adhere to new legal demands and policies originating from governments and social groups advocating for privacy protection. However, the potential environmental impact related to FL remains unclear and unexplored. This article offers the first-ever systematic study of the carbon footprint of FL. We propose a rigorous model to quantify the carbon footprint, hence facilitating the investigation of the relationship between FL design and carbon emissions. We also compare the carbon footprint of FL to traditional centralized learning. Our findings show that, depending on the configuration, FL can emit up to two orders of magnitude more carbon than centralized training. However, in certain settings, it can be comparable to centralized learning due to the reduced energy consumption of embedded devices. Finally, we highlight and connect the results to the future challenges and trends in FL to reduce its environmental impact, including algorithms efficiency, hardware capabilities, and stronger industry transparency.

AB  - In the present era, addressing the uncertainty related with green energy and request side response has developed a notable challenge in microgrid (MG) management operations. Conventionally, optimizing dispatch involves establishing odds distribution functions for renewables and the linked load model. Despite numerous modeling approaches, few consider customer approval, often relying on complex parameter-solving algorithms. This paper introduces an ideal deployment strategy for a thermoelectric-coupled MG to tackle these issues. Utilizing a digital twin framework that incorporates thermoelectric technology and Renewable Energy Resources (RERs), the study employs a Modified Biogeography Enhancement Algorithm (MBOA) for effective economic dispatch. Initially, a parameter simplification method is anticipated to address RE uncertainty, incorporating normal distribution odds functions and reserve capability allocation prices. Additionally, the paper takes into account the impact of transferable and reducible loads on customer approval for request side response, considering the load tracking capability on renewables. An enhanced biogeography-driven enhancement algorithm is presented to optimize the anticipated system. Computer simulations and comparisons validate the efficiency of the strategy in dropping the MG's functioning prices, emphasizing the importance of sustainable energy management practices that integrate waste heat recovery and renewable resources in contemporary power systems.

AB  - Quantities of end-of-life electronics (or e-waste) around the world keep growing. More than 1.36 million metric tons of e-waste were discarded in the U.S. in 2005, mainly in landfills, and e-waste is projected to grow in future years. This paper explores issues relating to planning future e-waste regulation and management systems in the U.S. It begins by reviewing the existing U.S. recycling systems to establish the importance of developing public responses. The paper then discusses what specific conditions are expected to influence the acceptability and implementation domestically. A key consideration is the cultural imperative in the U.S. for market-driven solutions that enable competition. Given this context, a solution is proposed that is designed to ensure a proper end-of-life management while at the same time establishing a competitive market for reuse and recycling services. The solution, termed e-market for returned deposit, begins with a deposit paid by consumers to sellers at the time of purchase, electronically registered and tracked via a radio-frequency identification device (RFID) placed on the product. At end-of-life, consumers consult an Internet-enabled market in which firms compete to receive the deposit by offering consumers variable degrees of return on the deposit. After collection of the computer by the selected firm, the cyberinfrastructure utilizes the RFID to transfer the deposit to the winning firm when recycled. If the firm chooses to refurbish or resell the computer in lieu of recycling, the transfer is deferred until true end-of-life processing.

AB  - Over the last few years, the rapid development of smart grids and the deployment of smart metering infrastructures on a much larger scale have raised a crucial privacy concern related to the collection of real-time energy consumption data. For these purpose, data aggregation is a widely used technique for privacy preservation. Securing the data aggregation process is a challenge since smart grids are susceptible to many cyber security threats and attacks. Therefore, several approaches have been proposed to address this issue. However, many of them are vulnerable to various types of attacks and suffer from high communication and computation costs in addition to the use of complex key management schemes. To overcome this problem, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme based on homomorphic encryption. In this solution, we take advantage of the opportunities offered by ECEL-Gamal and its homomorphic property as well as the ECDSA and ECDHE algorithms to use them in order to aggregate privacy-preserving data. Through detailed analyses, we show that our proposed scheme can meet various security requirements and preserves user privacy. In addition, experiment results demonstrate that our scheme is more efficient than existing competing approaches in terms of communication and computation overhead.

AB  - The four components of production are land, labour, capital, and organisation, and in current information age, ICT which is information and communication technology, regarded as the fifth most important factor in decision-making. Decision-making is a vital aspect of every process in any profession around the earth. Our ultimate goal in such procedures is to maximize the benefits through optimization. However, due to the digital disparity in the agriculture sector, ICT for decision-making has still not permeated every earner. Several studies on the digital divide in Indian agriculture have been undertaken in the past, ranging from macro to micro levels, and from general to specialized elements of activities. However, because agricultural operations are so intertwined, any intervention or arrangement at one level or element will have an impact on other levels and aspects. As a result, a thorough knowledge of the digital gap in India's agriculture and the rural sector is required, as is the development of thorough and realistic solutions to the problem. Finding the right solution would aid in the integration of actors in the agriculture supply chain, as well as the inclusive and sustainable growth of the nation.

AB  - Energy policy is often formulated in a gender-neutral manner; that is, it is assumed by policy makers that women and men use and benefit equally from current energy systems. However, research shows that energy policy is, in fact, gender blind--policies are incorrectly considered neutral by policy makers since they ignore the differential impacts they have on different genders and socioeconomic and cultural groups. Based on such false assumptions, the policies are less effective and/or have unintended effects. This paper discusses these issues.

AB  - Edge intelligent computing is widely used in the fields, such as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), which has advantages, including high data processing efficiency, strong real-time performance and low network delay. However, there are many problems including privacy disclosure, limited calculation force, as well as scheduling and coordination issues. Federated learning can greatly improves training efficiency. However, due to the sensitive nature of the healthcare data, the aforementioned approach of transferring the patient’s data to the servers may create serious security and privacy issues. Therefore, this article proposes a Privacy Protection Scheme for Federated Learning under Edge Computing (PPFLEC). First of all, we propose a lightweight privacy protection protocol based on a shared secret and weight mask, which is based on a random mask scheme of secret sharing. It is more accurate and efficient than,homomorphic encryption. It can not only protect gradient privacy without losing model accuracy, but also resist equipment dropping and collusion attacks between devices. Second, we design an algorithm based on a digital signature and hash function, which achieves the integrity and consistency of the message, as well as resisting replay attacks. Finally, we propose a periodic average training strategy, compared with differential privacy to prove that our scheme is 40$\%$ faster in efficiency than in deferential privacy. Meanwhile, compared with federated learning, we can achieve the same efficiency under the condition of ensuring safety. Therefore, our scheme can work well in unstable edge computing environments such as smart healthcare.

AB  - Electronic waste management is a critical issue in today's world that demands our immediate attention. The impact of improper management of e-waste, especially mobile phones and computers, can result in severe problems like health and environmental hazards and significant economic loss. With the global production of e-waste exceeding 7 million tonnes and expected to reach 300 million tonnes by 2025, it is imperative to develop a sustainable mechanism for its management. Governmental and non-governmental organizations are working to create better e-waste management solutions that will help reduce e-waste dumping and encourage recycling. Our solution involves using blockchain technology to ensure the transparency, trace-ability, and accountability of the e-waste management process. Additionally, we propose incentivizing society members through digital tokens or NFTs, promoting their active participation in e-waste reduction. Our proposed solution can create a sustainable and eco-friendly society by addressing e-waste management challenges. Blockchain technology and smart contracts will guarantee seamless and efficient e-waste management, promoting transparency and accountability. By incentivizing society members, we can encourage their active participation in reducing e-waste dumping and encourage recycling and refurbishing efforts. This paper also discusses the performance evaluation of smart contracts using a benchmark tool.

AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICT), such as televisions, cell phones and computers, are an indispensable part of everyday life. They make life easier, but they also have a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption in the use phase and demand for critical raw materials. Since 2005, the EU Ecodesign Directive has aimed to improve the environmental performance of energy-consuming and later energy-related products and plays an important role in the regulation of ICT products. For a long time, the focus of regulations developed under the Ecodesign framework has been on energy consumption in the use phase. However, for ICT products, both the raw materials and the end-of-life phases are of particular importance. This paper examines how products, and in particular ICT products, have been regulated under the Ecodesign Directive. Building on an existing assessment, we conduct an analysis to identify the coverage of specific, generic and informational circular economy related requirements. We use a keyword analysis of the legislative texts and compare ICT products with other product groups such as lighting products and white goods. We find a clear increase of circular economy requirements in recent ICT legislation, with many requirements for spare parts similar to the white goods product family. A particularly strong increase of circular economy requirements was found in the 2023 smartphone regulation, which also includes several requirements on durability, which were previously mainly found in lighting regulations. The high level of ambition of recent regulations could be seen as the next step in the evolution of ecodesign, paving the way for an expansion of the scope beyond a focus on greenhouse gases and energy-related products.

AB  - Energy efficiency measures and climate policies are closely related to strategic concerns of companies, and reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has become an important indicator of energy efficiency measures. This paper discusses the application aspects of organizational carbon footprint (CF) for telecommunications companies. In order to better understand the structure of overall (direct and indirect) GHG emission, the model for calculating the organizational CF was established for the case of a telecom operator in its initial stages of carbon policy. In order to understand the importance of scope 3 categories in the overall CF, calculated results were compared to CF results reported by three other European telecommunications operators. The results for a particular case based on Slovenian operator revealed that the largest contributor to GHG emissions is the consumption of purchased electricity. The employees’ commute to and from work, the use of company-owned vehicles, and heating represent the next major sources of GHG emissions. It was shown that the most contributive upstream scope 3 aspects are similar for various European telecommunication operators and that exclusion of some categories along the supply chain may give a distorted image of organizational CF. However, the comparative analysis revealed that using only the company's own-recorded in-house data can be far from sufficient to make conclusions which GHG emissions scope contributes the highest share to the overall organizational CF of telecommunications companies. In this context, this paper reveals new findings on the relevance of CF determination for telecommunications companies as a guideline for reconsidering their energy efficiency and sustainability plans.

AB  - Every country struggles to maintain a balance between environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. Rapid industrialization and urbanization have exacerbated ecological degradation, making innovative approaches essential for sustainable development. Although digitalization and green innovation potentially improve ecological outcomes, their impact on BRICS-T countries must be explored. This study addresses this gap by analyzing how digitalization, green technology innovation, and financial inclusion relate to environmental degradation in BRICS-T nations by employing advanced econometric techniques such as the Non-linear KSS Unit Root Test, Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR). The study's findings indicate that digitalization, mainly through data centers and networks, demands substantial energy, primarily from fossil fuel sources, leading to increased emissions. However, green innovation consistently reduces emissions across all quantiles. Increased financial inclusion is associated with higher emissions, particularly at lower and middle quantiles. The interaction between digitalization and green innovation results in a reduction of emissions across all quantiles. Conversely, the combined effect of financial inclusion and digitalization leads to higher emissions, especially in BRICS-T economies. These insights are crucial for BRICS-T nations as they seek to achieve sustainable development goals through technological advancements.

AB  - This study proposes the relationship between carbon trading and blockchain and moves forward to find solutions to the major problem of reduction of carbon footprint on our planet. The “Kyoto Protocol ” of 1997 introduced the need for a mechanism to trade grants issued, allowing the restricted emissions of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and creating an ecosystem for trading the surplus and deficiency of these credits/grants. This study aims at making this trade fraud free by using the powerful features of the blockchain like that of decentralization and a trustless environment by using different smart contracts that operate between multiple stakeholders in the ecosystem, the first contract creates a distributed ledger register for stakeholders, next quantifies CO2 consumptions and mints carbon tokens, third helps in verification of CO2 consumptions and the final contract is a DAO for voting on governance issues. Thus, this work proposes a blockchain based solution for trading of carbon credits to solve the problem of climate change.

AB  - While acknowledging the widespread recognition of artificial intelligence's (AI) potential in achieving sustainable development, there remains a notable deficiency and thorough examination of its specific applications, impacts, and challenges, particularly within the construction industry. A comprehensive investigation is critical to explore and understand the multifaceted applications of AI in fostering sustainability across all phases of a construction project. This paper aims to examine how AI can be effectively integrated across the key project phases—i.e., planning, design, construction, and operation and maintenance, through a systematic literature review to map AI applications, their impacts, adoption challenges, and best practices. The findings revealed: (a) Sustainable development goals (SDGs) pertinent to the construction industry—i.e., SDGs 6-9,11-13,15,17; (b) SDGs that show the highest potential to promote sustainability within the construction industry—i.e., SDGs 7,9,11; (c) Within the spectrum of these goals, AI can potentially transform the construction industry and contribute to the sustainability consideration processes in a more efficient and resilient ways; (d) Ethical considerations, data privacy and security concerns must be addressed, along with an urgent need for specialised training and maintenance of these AI systems; (e) Careful AI implementation and management is essential to harness its full potential, while addressing adoption challenges within the construction sector.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced at an astounding rate and transformed numerous economic sectors. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of how AI can improve the agri-food industry is lacking. In addition, there is a notable dearth of research on AI that investigates the influence of AI on agri-food resources and educates practitioners on the significance of knowledge-based and smart agriculture. We utilised bibliometric analysis to investigate the present state of the art and emerging trends in the relationship between AI and the agri-food industry. The research identified three distinct growth phases and the most prevalent AI strategies in the industry. In addition, we analysed key trends and offered researchers and practitioners insightful recommendations for future research. Using resource-based view (RBV) as the theoretical lens, this study established a framework emphasising the long-term effects of AI on various agri-food resources and proposed several research propositions. In addition, AI-related obstacles have been identified and categorised into four major categories. Lastly, the originality of the article lies in its numerous research suggestions and recommendations for advancing the AI field in the agri-food industry.

AB  - Digital financial inclusion (DFI) is an enabler for achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality. We use China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data spanning 2014 to 2020 to investigate the impact of DFI on household food carbon footprint (HFCF) in China. We find that (1) DFI has an inverted U-shaped effect on HFCF, changing from promotion to suppression; (2) The impact of DFI on HFCF demonstrates multidimensional heterogeneity. The impact of DFI on HFCF demonstrates multidimensional heterogeneity. The inverted U-shaped relationship is more pronounced in non-agricultural households, households with high-educated head, high-income households, households with unhealthy lifestyle heads, low-status households, households without the Internet, and households in the eastern, central, low-industrialization, high-urbanization and low-environmental regulation region; (3) Environmental concern and future expectations significantly moderate the inverted U-shaped relationship between DFI and HFCF, where environmental concern strengthens and future expectations weaken the effect; (4) Considering the dimensions of DFI, usage depth and digitization level of DFI have nonlinear effects on HFCF, while coverage breadth consistently exerts a positive influence. Policy implications are derived from the research results.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a prominent role in smart cities' development and offers benefits to different services such as finance, healthcare, security, agriculture, transport, education, and manufacturing. Despite the expected benefits, the adoption of AI varies from one smart city to another, due in part to barriers that can inhibit a smart city from adopting AI. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive view of the barriers faced by smart cities. Through a systematic literature review, this study identifies 18 primary and secondary barriers grouped into three main categories — technology, environment, and organization. This research contributes to the literature by developing a typology of AI adoption barriers based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) perspective. The typology provides a novel mapping of the barriers to AI adoption faced by smart cities and suggests directions for further investigation through a cohesive research agenda. At a practical level, the findings will allow policymakers, planners, and citizens to make more informed decisions about AI adoption. Practical implications are also proposed for guiding smart cities to increase the adoption of AI.

AB  - The purpose of this review is integrating and contextualizing relevant literature on the factors influencing the adoption of AI in the healthcare industry into a comprehensive framework. Health systems are considered fundamental to creating societal value. However, global health systems are challenged by the increasing number of patients due to population aging and the growing prevalence of chronic diseases and cancer. Meanwhile, the United Nations calls for equal access to healthcare, tackling costs, and addressing resource constraints to foster the sustainable development of societies. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining attention as it constitutes a promising technology to address these burgeoning challenges. Despite opportunities, the literature specifically on the adoption of AI in the healthcare industry is fragmented across various research fields, lacking a comprehensive overview. It lacks theoretically grounded research integrating, for example, the factors that influence the adoption of AI in healthcare institutions. Derived from a multi-disciplinary systematic literature review, building on 130 studies, we propose the Adoption of AI in the Healthcare Industry Model. This model encompasses five dimensions influencing the adoption of AI in the healthcare industry and contextualizes them. We propose that macro-economic, regulatory, and technological readiness serve as external antecedents whereas organizational and individual readiness constitute internal antecedents influencing adoption of AI in healthcare institutions. Our review has implications for research on technology acceptance related to AI in healthcare. Further, we provide hands-on guidance for AI providers, health institutions, and official bodies such as governments to foster the adoption of AI to leverage value.

AB  - A virtual power plant (VPP) refers to an active aggregator of heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs), which creates a promising pathway to expand renewable energy and demand-side electrification for deep decarbonization. The VPP market is projected to have a significant growth potential, with the global investment surging from $6.47 billion in 2022 to $16.90 billion by 2030. Up to now, VPPs still face technical challenges in dealing with the inherent uncertainty of DERs, and data emerge as a promising and essential resource to handle this issue. This paper makes the first effort to review the development of VPP technologies from a data-centric perspective, and then analyze the major role of data within every decision phase of VPPs. We examine the VPP energy management through a data lifecycle lens, and extensively survey the progress in data creation, data communication, data-driven decision support, data sharing and privacy, as well as technical solutions stemming from reinforcement learning, peer-to-peer sharing, blockchain, and market participation. In addition, we offer a unique overview of open data and recent real-world projects around the world to showcase the latest VPP practices. We finally discuss the major challenges and future opportunities in detail, with a focus on topics such as public benchmarks, internet of things, 5G, explainable artificial intelligence, and federated learning. We highlight the need for technical advances in data management and support systems for the growing scale of future VPP systems, and suggest VPPs delivering more ancillary grid services in the future.

AB  - The aim of this work is to quantify, assess, and identify hotspots in the environmental sustainability of newly constructed ICT networks designed to provide internet access (4 G LTE mobile technology) to regions still lacking this service. The analysis has been carried out on six demographic areas, from high-density urban and peri‑urban to remote rural, using ISO 14,040. A Dynamic Inventory Model (DIM) relating demographic/connectivity features with foreground material and energy inventories was validated using real data from Peru. The results showed carbon footprints between 81 and 103 kg CO2 eq./subscription/year, equivalent to 1.35 – 1.73 kg CO2 eq./Gb. Most of this (between 68 and 86%) correspond to end user devices, primarily in the form of embodied emissions. Operational emissions account for about one-third of the total and derive primarily from the electricity consumed by end user devices, and to a lower extent by access networks and data centers. Linear correlations were observed between operational - embodied carbon emissions and the number of subscribers. This trend was overturned in very small ICT networks designed to serve sparsely populated rural areas, due to higher energy consumption and carbon emissions per functional unit generated by access and IP network components. The robustness of these results was studied through sensitivity and uncertainty analyses.

AB  - Summary Detecting and quantifying marine pollution and macroplastics is an increasingly pressing ecological issue that directly impacts ecology and human health. Here, remote sensing can provide reliable estimates of plastic pollution by regularly monitoring and detecting marine debris in coastal areas. In this work, we present a detector for marine debris built on a deep segmentation model that outputs a probability for marine debris at the pixel level. We train this detector with a combination of annotated datasets of marine debris and evaluate it on specifically selected test sites where it is highly probable that plastic pollution is present in the detected marine debris. We integrate data-centric artificial intelligence principles by devising a training strategy with extensive sampling of negative examples and an automated label refinement of coarse hand labels. This yields a deep learning model that achieves higher accuracies on benchmark comparisons than existing detection models trained on previous datasets.

AB  - With cities being responsible for approximately 70% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable urban development becomes key to reduce climate impact. The use of monitoring frameworks for sustainable or smart cities has been promoted as a model of action in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals. At the same time, the wide diversity of cities and their specific size and local conditions make it difficult to standardize urban development processes, especially when the data gathered in each case may differ in focus, mode of collection or reporting. This paper studies the use of sustainable urban development monitoring frameworks and their alignment to the Sustainable Development Goals from the perspective of ten Norwegian small and medium sized cities. It also explores the potential of monitoring frameworks to support small and medium sized cities in meeting their climate targets and the suitability of such frameworks for cities of these sizes.

The repercussions of global climate change are becoming increasingly evident, which led to climate change being named the “greatest global health threat of the twenty-first century.” As a result, the international community established an ambitious plan for going green, promoting human development, and preserving the biosphere by adopting the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. As a result, international cooperation efforts have been increasingly put forward. This paper presents ways in which the Internet of Things could benefit the current efforts toward climate change mitigation endeavors. We discuss state-of-the-art projects that have been established worldwide to use recent advancements in 5G/6G technologies and IoT to monitor, model, and combat the impacts of global climate change on agriculture, water resources depletion, and coastal erosion.

AB  - Sustainable development is crucial to securing the future of humanity. Blockchain as a disruptive technology and a driver for social change has exhibited great potential to promote sustainable practices and help organizations and governments achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Existing literature reviews on blockchain and sustainability often focus only on topics related to a few SDGs. There is a need to consolidate existing results in terms of SDGs and provide a comprehensive overview of the impacts that blockchain technology may have on each SDG. This paper intends to bridge this gap, presenting a tertiary review based on 42 literature reviews, to investigate the relationship between blockchain and sustainability in light of SDGs. The method used is a consensus-based expert elicitation with thematic analysis. The findings include a novel and comprehensive mapping of impact-based interlinkage of blockchain and SDGs and a systematic overview of drivers and barriers to adopting blockchain for sustainability. The findings reveal that blockchain can have a positive impact on all 17 SDGs though some negative effects can occur and impede the achievement of certain objectives. 76 positive and 10 negative linkages between blockchain adoption and the 17 SDGs as well as 45 factors that drive or hinder blockchain adoption for the achievement of SDGs have been identified. Research gaps to overcome the barriers and enhance blockchain’s positive impacts have also been identified. The findings may help managers in evaluating the applicability and tradeoffs, and policymakers in making supportive measures to facilitate sustainability using blockchain.

AB  - The generation of e-waste reached 52 million metric tons worldwide in 2020, growing at a pace of 3 % each year. Despite the urgency, the bulk of the created e-waste was disposed of inappropriately, with just 20% adhering to standard recycling methods. Taking care of this pressing issue is in line with the sixth Sustainable Development Goal 12 of the UN, which highlights the significance of responsible production and consumption. Studies on electronics waste and its effects on the environment have published much more often in recent decades. This research uses bibliometric analysis, and to graphically map current patterns and upcoming hotspots in the studying environment, VOSviewer software is used. Soil, health, environmental effect, recovery, technology, and electronic and electrical scrap are important study topics that have been designated as hotspots. A review of research trends over time indicates a move toward laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, e-waste creation, and circular economy factors.

AB  - The vision of the Internet of Production (loP) is focused on optimizing manufacturing processes, with the help of Industry 4.0 technologies (14Ts). However, considering global megatrends such as climate change and the need to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is a growing imperative for the manufacturing industry to become more sustainable. This opens the door to transforming the IoP into an Internet of Sustainable Production (loSP). Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel four-step loSP-framework that establishes an Information System (IS) allowing researchers and practitioners to acknowledge and adapt to the interconnected nature of sustainability. Further, to test its applicability, an inter- and cross-disciplinary perspective is adopted to illustrate case-related challenges, opportunities, and pathways - revealed by the proposed framework - in the example of a digital economy for sustainability data, strategic design of global production networks, human-robot collaboration, digital photonic production, and the textile industry. Together, the framework demonstrates the usefulness of generating holistic information on the interconnected nature of sustainability derived from process-specific and contextualized data, while simultaneously assessing the framework's utilization for sustainability, as well as the sustainability of its use.

AB  - General electrification, specifically renewable-based off-grid systems, could contribute to sustainable development in Bangladesh. However, it is important to make sure that it contributes or at least does not act inhibitory in any of the three dimensions of sustainability. This study examines the potential of demand-side management and electrified cooking as sustainable solutions for off-grid electricity in Bangladesh. The evaluation is based on techno-economic, environmental, and social aspects, using a set of selected indicators. The study employs two tools, RAMP and MicroGridsPy, to optimize techno-economic results. The environmental evaluations are based on the result of the techno-economic evaluation and literature review, while the social aspect evaluations are based on the literature review and the author's own remarks and experiences. The analysis is completed using a sustainability matrix in the form of a simplified multi-criteria analysis. This study investigates the impact of peak shaving by fans and TVs and the introduction of electrified cooking in an off-grid electrification system. In Bangladesh, both approaches have positive economic and environmental impacts, but peak shaving has a negative social impact. The study finds that the result can contribute to sustainable development of off-grid electricity system in Bangladesh.

AB  - The use of product families can improve the efficiency of product development as opposed to develop a single-product by reusing existing artefacts and optimizing variability, which leads to a saving of resources and is therefore a sustainable approach. To extend new variants of an already modelled product via the approach of a product family the challenge is to merge the product models, so that the same and varying parts in the model are semantically correct identified and mapped to each other. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for sustainable development of product families using the Distributed Ontology Language (DOL), Functional Architectures for Systems (FAS), and Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The proposed approach integrates the idea of DOL to represent an ontology of sustainability criteria and to map them to the functional architecture of a product family. FAS is used to model the functional architecture of the product family, while the FAS ontology is used to formalize the functional architecture and provide a standardized vocabulary and set of rules for modelling the functional aspects of the product family. SysML is used to model the product family. The proposed method is demonstrated through a case study of developing a sustainable product family of vacuum cleaner robots. The results show that the proposed method can help to identify opportunities for reducing environ-mental impact and improving social responsibility in the product family design while ensuring that functional requirements and design constraints are met semantically correct.

AB  - Digital twins function as digital replicas of physical entities and play a pivotal role as facilitators in the digital world. They establish and foster the communication bridge between the physical and digital realms. Conversely, the metaverse represents an extension of digital twins, recognized as the 3D evolution of the Internet. These technologies aim to narrow the divide between the digital domain and human interaction, garnering considerable attention from academia and industry. Despite the metaverse predating digital twins by a decade, it remains in its emerging stages. In contrast, digital twins have found extensive applications across diverse fields. However, they are plagued by numerous security and privacy vulnerabilities that demand resolution for future communications. Therefore, leveraging the immutability and transparency inherent in blockchain, we have implemented these features into digital twins within the metaverse to enhance security and privacy. Consequently, a blockchain-empowered framework for the metaverse utilizing digital twins has been outlined. Furthermore, we have showcased the diverse applications of digital twins in the metaverse across various sectors. We have also designed a supply chain digital twins use-case scenario within the metaverse. The conceptual design and implementation details for the supply chain use case are discussed, focusing on traceability and data immutability. The proposed supply chain scenario is validated concerning various computational metrics. Finally, research trajectories concerning blockchain-based digital twins in the metaverse have been explored.

AB  - The 5G networks will be governed by laws on supply chain cybersecurity since they are crucial for the digital transformation of the economy and societies [1]. Numerous European documents emphasize cyber vulnerabilities in the supply chain and call on Member States to pass legislation allowing suppliers to be risk-assessed. According to the EU Toolbox, these analyses should consider technical and non- technical concerns, such as the supplier's dependency on foreign nations [2]. Many countries have yet to implement legislation in this area, and the proposed law establishing a national cybersecurity system still lacks provisions for identifying high- risk vendors. The primary factor evaluated in the risk assessment will be a threat to national security. These criteria must be explained, and they may become more so in the future due to the specifics of the processes (restricted right to participate in proceedings, limited access to information). The significant repercussions of the procedures (the necessity to return the merchandise) may raise some concerns regarding commercial freedom. The number of legal requirements related to supply chain cybersecurity will grow because of new cutting- edge technologies like 5G, the need to safeguard cybersecurity, and the world's growing political polarization.

AB  - Implementing blockchain technology in agricultural supply chains has the potential to revolutionize and increase transparency, efficiency and trust between all parties. A variation of the white paper discussed how blockchain can be a transformative tech in addressing major challenges especially on traceability, fraud prevention and sustainability on agriculture. Blockchain (for those hearing about this for the first time) can provide a system where every step of even complex supply chains is perfectly recorded, enabling transactions to take place in a secure way and offering transparency, immutability, accountability. Case studies and real-world examples showcased throughout the paper depict how blockchain could enhance operational efficiencies, boost food safety, authenticate products, and cut waste across agriculture. While very promising, the implementation of blockchain technology in agriculture is not without its own issues; this includes obligatory industry standards as well as highly costly technical implementations. The paper also highlights the potential for blockchain to contribute to sustainable agriculture by allowing better tracking of environmental footprints and ethical sourcing. In summary, we propose that the flexibility of blockchain technology renders it an ideal approach to revolutionizing supply chains in the agriculture sector, as we continue down a trajectory towards increased levels of visibility and productivity with improved environmental outcomes. This paper contributes towards a more comprehensive understanding of the role of blockchain in scenario-based selection as it addresses both opportunities and challenges due to adoption of block chain which gives technology and agriculture a new future(directions).

AB  - A number of countries have adopted national policies and directives to balance the advantages and disadvantages of innovative technologies. The purpose of this paper is to identify the most prominent topics addressed by national AI policies, as well as their relative importance across nations. This paper integrates the results of a topic modeling analysis of 30 national AI policies with a qualitative content analysis of the policies. Based on this analysis, fourteen main common themes have been identified among national AI policies, which predominantly relate to educational, technological, government, ethical/legal, and social good concerns. Following this, we conducted a co-occurrence analysis of topics across countries to determine the extent of topic prioritization in each country. In this investigation, several marginalized AI policy topics were also identified. In general, the challenges and concerns of the majority of policies pertain to education, technology, and the government. Governments refer to real-world projects and investments in AI technologies without developing shared digital governance platforms that promote responsible and sustainable AI among technology titans and mitigate the negative effects of surveillance capitalism. Although governments acknowledge the ethical and legal aspects of AI development and frequently cite the GDPR, they limit their discussion to the data level, particularly data sharing, and marginalize ethical algorithms and other phases of data and AI management and design. In addition, government policies marginalize AI startups and the API economy, even though they play a crucial role in fostering the AI ecosystem. The paper contributes to the existing literature on AI policy and will serve as a guide for AI policymakers to help them better understand the topical similarities across countries and the neglected or marginalized challenges that require further attention.

AB  - Plastic and polymers are late entrants in the repository of engineering materials, compared to bronze and iron (early phases of human civilizations are named after them). However, the extent of usage of the former is growing at an exponential rate because of the near-infinite combinatorial possibilities. In fact, there are hardly few engineering disciplines that can potentially offer so large and endless unexploited possibilities. Plastic industries are widespread across the world due to their easy scalability, favorable economics and extremely diverse applications. Plastic manufacturing and recycling are especially important for the economy of a country and provide livelihood for a large population. It is imperative that the current processes in plastic be improved upon by the advantages offered by computational tools and digital technologies. At this stage, we desperately need new age tools that can properly guide the human enterprise of innovation in designing, perfection in processing while maintaining stringent quality requirements in manufacturing. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) perfectly fits this bill for the new age tools. We are at a very nascent stage of this AI/ML revolution. This article samples some of the pioneering works from the very discreet space of AI/ML applications in the field of plastic and polymer designing, processing and manufacturing and attempts to tie them up in a cohesive narrative. For the sake of completeness, applications of AI/ML for limiting the adverse environmental impact and future outlook have also been covered.

AB  - New digital technologies help to curtail those that are carbon intensive but are accompanied by CO2 emissions due to their own energy demand. Whether digitalization relates to increased or decreased carbon emissions may depend on the sophistication of an economy's research and development (R&D) output. This study explores the R&D-induced regime transition that governs the relationship between digitalization and CO2 emissions. The study seeks evidence of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis and tests it with a panel smooth transition regression (PSTR). Employing this estimator with two R&D output regimes makes it possible to account for year- and country-varying effects of digitalization, human capital, and country income level on CO2 emission. The research covers 55 high- and middle-income economies from 1996 to 2019. The paper finds that the transition process is driven by R&D output level – measured in technology patents per country inhabitants. The findings support the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis and confirm that CO2 emissions have an inverted U-shaped relationship with digitalization and income level. This nonlinear relationship transitions smoothly in the exogenous R&D output level. The digitalization indicator in the lower R&D regime has a significant point estimate of 0.07; in the higher regime, the estimate is −0.14. The R&D output threshold at which the transition function switches between the two regimes corresponds to a level of 39.9 technology patents per million inhabitants.

AB  - Minimizing the costs of cloud services is important for cloud service providers to grow their business. In cost calculation of cloud services, power consumption cost is a major factor. The variability present in renewable power generation, electricity price, and power demand variates the power utilization expenditures. Due to high computational requests, datacenters consume enormous energy every day, thereby necessitating the need for energy efficient designs. Therefore, an energy consumption cost reduction mechanism is required to optimize the data center’s power consumption cost locally and to have the option to redistribute the workload on geo-distributed data centers in peak hours for further reduction in power consumption cost. In this paper, the authors investigate the energy consumption cost optimization problem in cloud datacenters and propose a blockchain-based decentralized workload distribution and management model. Moreover, we minimize request scheduler time for transferring any job from one data center to another and secure the energy cost optimization process due to shut down/ communication failure. The proposed work is the primitive to present the energy cost optimization problem in geo-distributed data centers by introducing blockchain-based secure workload scheduling method considering both the temporal and spatial disparities associated with electricity tariffs and workload arrival process. The simulations are evaluated on real-world workload of the Google data center and associated electricity tariffs. The blockchain-based decentralized workload management framework is evaluate based on privacy and security analysis, update overhead, latency, and throughput. Moreover, the results show blockchain model migrate workload in minimum 46 % reduced time compared to conventional model.

AB  - Clean and renewable energy resources like solar energy are essential for a sustainable and eco-friendly future, as they decrease reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change. This study explores trust and knowledge as drivers of solar energy consumption behavior (SECB). Particularly, this study finds the role of social influence and gender as moderators in the associations between trust and SECB, as well as knowledge and SECB. The World Bank energy access data based on the 8500 Pakistani households survey was examined for empirical analysis. Findings reveal that trust and knowledge positively impact SECB. Knowledge also influences trust in solar energy. Meanwhile, higher social influence weakens the association of knowledge and trust with SECB. Furthermore, it was found that the association of knowledge and trust with SECB is stronger for females than males. The findings-based implications are provided for practitioners and researchers.

AB  - Internet is widely regarded as a necessary resource for economic and social development. The availability of this technology requires the deployment of ICT networks which have implications not only on the natural surroundings but also on the human environment. Understanding the impact generated on key areas of socio-ecological concern such as carbon footprint and employment generation is essential to ensure well-informed decision-making. This investigation utilized multiregional environmentally extended input-output (MRIO) methodology to evaluate the carbon footprint and the employment generation associated with providing internet to six geo-demographic scenarios, from urban to remote rural, using Peru as a reference site. The results showed that most of the carbon emissions (289–340 kg CO2 eq./subs./yr.) and employment (7–8 jobs/subs./yr.) associated with larger ICT networks intended for urban and suburban areas was attributable to the manufacturing of end-user devices. The sustainability of smaller ICT networks for rural areas was dominated by the construction of shared infrastructures (mainly 4G LTE equipment), while the contribution of the energy consumed was in all cases limited. Although the analysis considered ICT networks deployed in Peru, most impacts were generated in China, where the manufacturing of the electronic components was assumed to take place. This analysis highlights the value of econometric methods for sustainability assessment such as MR-EEIO, which are complementary to the more conventional process-based E-LCA.

AB  - Bitcoin is a breakthrough financial technology but a volatile asset in financial markets with a complex fundamental consensus algorithm (Proof-of-Work) limiting its large-scale adoption due to environmental-related issues. Hitherto, the role of its technical and infrastructural composition that drives carbon footprint from an ecological perspective is rarely discussed in the literature. Here, we use machine learning and econometric techniques to analyze the past, present, and future changes in Bitcoin's carbon footprint with daily data spanning July 18, 2010 to December 04, 2021. We document technical drivers, decomposition effects, causal nexus, and implications of the Bitcoin blockchain's increasing energy and carbon footprint. We show that Bitcoin's technical drivers could have potential impacts on Bitcoin's carbon footprint, and subsequently, global climate change. For example, the network's hashrate increases mining difficulty––thereby increasing Bitcoin's energy consumption and subsequently, carbon footprint. We observed a direct association between the marginal effect of block size and transaction count––implying that a higher block size improves transaction efficiency and then reduces Bitcoin's energy and carbon footprint. Besides, low mining difficulty increases market capitalization whereas increasing mining difficulty reduces bitcoin mining profit in the long run. This infers the reward for mining Bitcoin has a diminishing return in the long term. Thus, the adoption of advanced hardware for Bitcoin mining will spur energy and carbon intensity, yet will have a low return on investment. We highlight environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could limit Bitcoin's carbon footprint.

AB  - Business organizations across the world are increasingly articulating their commitment to build sustainable enterprises. Environmental stewardship, conscious and responsible consumption of natural resources required for day-to-day operations, is integral to this agenda. In this paper, we illustrate how a multinational enterprise has made significant strides in monitoring, conserving and improving materially relevant resources including energy, emissions, water, and waste through innovative use of various technologies. A campus that is fully powered by solar energy, reduction in per capita energy and fresh water consumption by 49.69% and 41.14% respectively over the baseline, carbon footprint reduction by 59% across scope of 1 and 2 emissions, and 100% food waste treatment are some of the important milestones it has achieved in accordance with the sustainability policy drawn along the lines of sustainable development goals (SDGs) announced by United Nations. We discuss the crucial role of technology in defining the sustainability agenda, enabling the achievement of audacious goals, and institutionalizing sustainable practices and lifestyles in this organization. We conclude by proposing new frontiers of technological innovation for sustainable development of enterprises.

AB  - There is growing consensus in literature and practice that digital technologies (DTs) can offer a wide range of potentials for implementing a circular economy in companies. However, empirical insights on how the potentials of different DTs are already realized across various industries are lacking. This study addresses this research gap through descriptive, hierarchical cluster and non-parametric analyses (Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman rank correlations) of the use of DTs for circular economy and sustainability management based on data collected in a structured telephone survey with 132 sustainability managers and CEOs of Austrian manufacturing companies. The paper shows for the first time the degree and stage of implementation of four key enabling DTs for a sustainable circular economy and 31 specific applications of those DTs across eight different industries. Of the four DTs, Internet of Things (IoT) technology is most widely implemented, followed by big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology. However, their use in sustainability management is still very limited and is currently mainly in pilot phases. Of the 31 applications surveyed, IoT technology is most frequently used for collecting data from production processes, AI for predictive maintenance, big data analytics for demand forecasting, and blockchain technology for tracking product origins. Statistically significant differences were found in the degree of digitalization, in general, and for sustainability management between industries and company sizes. A strong positive correlation between the implementation of digital technologies in general and their use in a sustainability management context indicates synergies and spillover effects. The findings may help to tailor context-specific and purpose-driven strategies that selectively leverage the benefits of different DTs and supporting sustainability management effectively. Further research may identify scalable best practices, optimal enabling conditions, and environmental and social outcomes.

AB  - Global plastic production is rapidly increasing, resulting in significant amounts of plastic entering the marine environment. This makes marine litter one of the most critical environmental concerns. Determining the effects of this waste on marine animals, particularly endangered organisms, and the health of the oceans is now one of the top environmental priorities. This article reviews the sources of plastic production, its entry into the oceans and the food chain, the potential threat to aquatic animals and humans, the challenges of plastic waste in the oceans, the existing laws and regulations in this field, and strategies. Using conceptual models, this study looks at a circular economy framework for energy recovery from ocean plastic wastes. It does this by drawing on debates about AI-based systems for smart management. In the last sections of the present research, a novel soft sensor is designed for the prediction of accumulated ocean plastic waste based on social development features and the application of machine learning computations. Plus, the best scenario of ocean plastic waste management with a concentration on both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is discussed using USEPA-WARM modeling. Finally, a circular economy concept and ocean plastic waste management policies are modeled based on the strategies of different countries. We deal with green chemistry and the replacement of plastics derived from fossil sources.

It is possible to gain a deep understanding of the object’s performance and potential areas for improvement by collecting data, which includes metrics such as energy output, temperature, and weather conditions. Digital twins are becoming important in a variety of research and industrial application sectors as production lines and processes become more digitalized and as improved data analysis techniques such as machine learning and enhanced visualization techniques are used. There is no unified definition of the digital twin concept in scientific literature, which results in imprecise applications and the weakening of its terminology. However, this study demonstrates how digital twin models can be applied to urban drainage systems. As a result, this highlights the relatively novel use of digital twins within the field of urban water system engineering. Our review of the language, practices, and directions in smart stormwater management provides a framework to organize and comprehend the current research landscape while highlighting crucial areas for future research. Our results demonstrate that there is near-unanimous agreement within the literature that smart technology has been, or will be, advantageous for stormwater management. However, while some progress has been made in terms of quantity management, maturity in water quality management has not yet been achieved. This study examines the scientific literature on digital twins in the application of artificial intelligence for smart city stormwater infrastructure systems, specifically focusing on urban drainage systems. A demonstration of the workflow and features of current digital twin applications in urban drainage systems is also presented, providing valuable insights and guidance for future research and development in this field.

AB  - A decarbonized food supply chain ensures that we have access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food with a reduced carbon footprint. It not only helps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also enhances food security by making the supply chain more resilient to climate-related disruptions, ensuring stable food production for a growing global population. Further, there is an increasing consumer demand for sustainably produced food, and meeting this demand is crucial for maintaining relevance and competitiveness in the global market. Without a well-functioning decarbonized supply chain, it would be much harder for farmers, processors, distributors, and retailers to promote food security and improve public health. Decarbonization in the food supply chain is a complex process that requires a multifaceted approach, with the entire supply chain from farm to fork being examined. Technological advances such as Industry 4.0, with a human-centric solution, could be an answer. By combining the power of Industry 4.0 with decarbonization efforts, the creation of a more sustainable and efficient food supply chain can be promised. Hence, this study utilizes a mixed-method approach to examine the Indian food supply chain, and analyses the factors that motivate stakeholders to implement decarbonized technologies. It uses opinions from industry as well as from academic experts for employing integrated Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Interpretive structural modelling (ISM). AHP revealed that “International community pressure” is the most critical factor. Further, ISM is used to explain the interrelationships among the identified factors, providing a hierarchical model. These key findings can assist policymakers to develop and refine regulations. Further, it can also help stakeholders to make an informed decision while allocating resources towards new technologies.

AB  - Industry 5.0 raises awareness towards converting conventional industrial technologies into smart technologies integrated with sustainable infrastructure for efficiently handling process systems, making them more energy and cost-efficient. New disruptive technologies are emerging due to recent scientific and technical developments, which profoundly affect various process systems. One such case of consideration is the algal cultivation for biomass production (ACB). A technology called an algal digital twin (ADT) has a great deal of promise to change existing ACB (For example raceway pond) into sustainable algal management systems (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Temperature, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), pH, Chlorophyll-a, etc.), and to develop their infrastructure in making them more energy efficient and cost-effective for the algal biomass cultivation. However, despite a recent increase in attention, there have not been adequate investigations exploring the challenges of deploying ADTs for controlling and monitoring ACB. This review provides a systematic literature analysis on adopting an ADT into ACB, which could address major difficulties and unresolved problems of the ACB. Also, this study identifies several key categories of hurdles, such as interconnection and semantics, facilities, acquiring data and actuation, data reliability, modelling (Artificial Intelligence of Things), simulation run, decision making, digitalization of data, accountability, as well as social concerns. Additionally, case studies for the ACB towards lipid production and wastewater treatment using ADT are reported. Overall, this comprehensive review aims to help practitioners gain insight into the deployment of ADT into ACB systems, “A way towards creating a sustainable smart infrastructure for ACB”.

AB  - Prostate cancer is one of the major health challenges in the world and needs novel therapeutic approaches to overcome the limitations of conventional treatment. This review delineates the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AL) in enhancing nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems for prostate cancer therapy. With its ability to optimize nanocarrier design and predict drug delivery kinetics, AI has revolutionized personalized treatment planning in oncology. We discuss how AI can be integrated with nanotechnology to address challenges related to tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and systemic toxicity. Emphasis is placed on strong AI-driven advancements in the design of nanocarriers, structural optimization, targeting of ligands, and pharmacokinetics. We also give an overview of how AI can better predict toxicity, reduce costs, and enable personalized medicine. While challenges persist in the way of data accessibility, regulatory hurdles, and interactions with the immune system, future directions based on explainable AI (XAI) models, integration of multimodal data, and green nanocarrier designs promise to move the field forward. Convergence between AI and nanotechnology has been one key step toward safer, more effective, and patient-tailored cancer therapy.

AB  - Distributed power generation from renewable energy sources is rapidly expanding and is serving as a clean energy alternative to fossil fuel-based energy sources, which pose significant environmental and health hazards. However, individuals still lack access to electricity and experience unreliable power supplies and services as demand increases. Energy distribution is still centralized, resulting in various challenges for users and contributing to disparities in energy distribution among individuals. To address these challenges, the predictive analytics approach and blockchain are employed together, while maintaining digital control and privacy for all participants in the decentralised energy trading system. The users can utilize their own historical energy consumption data to predict their own future energy requirements for the next period. Also, the prosumers (who both produce and consume energy) can predict their renewable energy generation. After analysing their consumption and generations users can use smart contracts to schedule and transfer energies over the blockchain network. This system guarantees transparency and security in energy trading between utility providers, prosumers, and consumers. The blockchain and smart contracts enables energy to be distributed fairly and automatically. This decentralization ensures digital autonomy within the energy trading system by enabling users to set their trading preferences, control their energy resources and data independently. This system with blockhain in energy trading builds trust among the participants. This proposed energy trading system is evaluated using a real world energy consumption and generation time series dataset of residential households. The proposed models for prediction are developed using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The results of both the models are compared using performance metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results of experimental evaluation show that this approach can ensure reliable and equitable energy distribution, while ensuring digital autonomy and sovereignty in the proposed energy trading system.

AB  - This paper examines linkages between digitalisation and information and communication technology (ICT)-related environmental sustainability business practices. Using a unified modelling framework and firm-level data from Ireland over 2020–2022, it provides novel evidence on complementarities between the use of digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) and the propensity of firms to adopt ICT-related environmental sustainability measures. The results indicate that the adoption of ICT-related sustainability measures has been uneven across groups of firms, sectors, and regions. The descriptive evidence shows that the most adopted measures are disposing of or recycling ICT equipment while the least adopted measures are measures to reduce the energy consumption of ICT equipment. The estimation results indicate that digitalisation is associated with a higher propensity of firms to adopt ICT-related sustainability practices over and above other firm characteristics such as firm size, employing ICT specialists, and investing in intangible assets. Firms using AI are more likely to adopt ICT-related sustainability practices. Taken together, the results of this paper suggest that targeted policy measures to incentivize more firms, in particular small and medium-sized, to adopt digital technologies and ICT-related environmental sustainability measures, could foster the twin digital and green transitions.

AB  - Heritage is a vital resource for storytelling, defining our identity and history, and adding dignity and uniqueness to our legacies for future generations. Therefore, it should be protected, and awareness needs to be created. Today, in the face of climate change challenges and natural disaster, some of our heritages, linked to natural landscapes, is endangered. This paper describes developing an alternative licensing model for NFTs and a mobile-based NFT marketplace created to promote and protect nature as a heritage in the face of climate change-induced dangers. By incorporating evidence about state-of-the-art, leveraging blockchain and NFTs technologies at the service of heritage, here we highlight two essential and unique aspects: i) ensuring the usage of zero-carbon blockchain solutions and the creation of temporary NFTs, and ii) enabling continuous income sources for the asset owners, in our case organisations devoted to the protection of the designated natural landscapes. In this paper, we describe the design process and the validation of the ideas behind the usage and licensing of zero-carbon temporary NFTs. Thus we propose a financially sustainable solution capable of showing the actual state of the lineage (for example, the changing aspect of a landscape over seasons) and promoting a continuous source of donations used to preserve the assets. We validated the concept with users and obtained good usability and design results, proving the chosen approach’s effectiveness.

AB  - According to United Nations (UN) 2030 agenda, the transportation system needs to be enhanced for the establishment of access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems along with enhanced road safety. The highway road transport system is one of the transport systems that enables to transits goods and humans from one location to another location. The agenda of UN 2030 for the transport system will be accomplished with the assistance of digital technologies like the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). The implementation of these digital technologies on highways empowers to provide reliable, smarter, intelligent, and renewable energy sources experience to the users travelling along the highways. This study discusses the significance of the digitalization of highways that supporting and realizing a sustainable environment on the highways. To discuss the significance of digitalization, the study has categorized digitalization into five subcomponents namely smart highway lighting system, smart traffic and emergency management system, renewable energy sources on highways, smart display and AI in highways. An architecture-for smart highway lighting, smart traffic, and emergency management are proposed and discussed in the study. The significance of implementing smart display boards and renewable sources with real-time applications is also addressed in this study. Moreover, the integration of AI in highways is addressed with the perspective of enhancing road safety. The integration of deep learning (DL) in the edge-based vision node for predicting the patterns of traffic flow, highway road safety, and maintenance of quality roads have been addressed in the discussion section. Embedding the deep learning techniques in the vison node at the traffic junction and the highway lighting controller is able to deliver an intelligent system that provides sustained experience and management of the highways. Smart reflectors, adoption of renewable energy, developing vehicle-to-vehicle communication in vehicles, and smart lamppost are the few recommendations for the implementation of digitalizing highways.

AB  - Electric Vehicles are considered to be dominant in the land transport system in the near future in context to decarbonisation and sustainability. Compared to conventional vehicles, electric and hybrid ones can reduce pollutants significantly. In present researches, there are many different chemistries of battery available for EV’s application but the technology which has been adopted for an effective solution for energy storage is mostly based on Li-ion. But Li-ion battery packs are highly acknowledged in EV industry as a result of their outstanding specific energy density, lifecycle, nominal voltage, low cost& performance. Monitoring on state estimation during charging and discharging becomes important so that battery pack can be utilized in better and effective manner for optimum output. Li-ion battery packs represent the soul of the majority of electric vehicles. So, its proper safe operating region must be clearly specified for desired output. To tackle these concerns, Battery Management System is such an important embedded mechanism to enhance the effectiveness of performance of the battery pack which includes precise monitoring, supervision of charging-discharging phenomenon, cell balancing, thermal management, safety of battery pack. The various intelligent strategies and cell balancing strategies used for the battery management system in EVs have been analysed i.e., review assesses experimental, model-based, and data-driven approaches. The detailed analysis has been incorporated in this review for intelligent algorithms i.e. FLC, SVM, PSO, ANN, and GA for battery SOC estimation in terms of their types, features, accuracy, key advantages, and key limitations.

AB  - Energy has been recognized as an essential contributor to the spread of prosperity and, consequently, an indispensable component in the economic growth of a nation. Renewable energy resources (RESs) have tremendous potential to enhance the sustainability of the energy system at a social, economic, and environmental scale. There are numerous RES in the form of hydropower, solar, biogas, biomass, wind, tidal, ocean thermal energy conversion, and geothermal energy. They have fewer adverse environmental impacts than conventional energy sources, and adopting such clean energy sources could also reduce costs. Renewable energy (RE) additionally enhances a substantial portion of the population to access it, while lessening the emission of domestic and international pollution. A distributed network approach can also provide low-cost environment-friendly electricity to rural areas. The financial barrier and geographical strata are often the main obstacles to adopting RE, particularly the initial costs of designing and operating turbines and solar power plants. This chapter aims to introduce RE regarding its sources, technologies, and applications. The description of the historical expansion of various RESs, their advantages and disadvantages concerning the environment, and climate change is given in this chapter. The significant steps for the optimum application of the advanced techniques of RES are recommended in this chapter.

Employing an analysis of six leading B2B firms engaged in digital servitization, we conceptualize the perceptive, predictive, and prescriptive capacities of AI, which enhance resource efficiency by automating and augmenting data-driven analysis and decision making. We further identify two innovative classes of AI-enabled CBMs – augmentation (e.g., optimization solutions) and automation (e.g., autonomous solutions) business models – and their main circular value drivers. Finally, our research reveals novel dynamic capabilities underpinning the innovation of AI-enabled business models – value discovery, value realization, and value optimization capabilities – which enable manufacturers to make economic and sustainable values come to life in collaborating with customers and ecosystem partners. This study represents an important step in our understanding of how AI can drive circularity and sustainable innovation in industrial digital servitization. Overall, our study contributes to practice and the academic literature on AI, circular business models, and digital servitization by highlighting the potential of AI to empower CBMs for industrial manufacturers and the underlying processes of this digital transformation.

AB  - Digitalization is a primary driver of sustainable development. We investigate the impact of digitalization on the carbon footprints of the (national) government sector, households, enterprises, non-governmental organizations, and imported carbon footprints. We use panel data analysis to study the link between digitalization and sustainable economic growth by monitoring digital carbon footprint patterns. Our study results show that digitalization has a positive and statistically significant impact on sustainability development measured by the sustainable development goals (SDG). Furthermore, our results support the hypothesis that advancing total factor productivity, referring to green total factor productivity, is critical for meeting SDGs. Notably, we determine that the ecological footprint across sectors and countries is diverging, or at best, slowly converging at a pace that is not even close to that required to meet the 2030 SDGs. Therefore, policymakers and practitioners must strategically revise sustainability policies to ensure industrial and economic transition and adaptability to climate change and advance economic green growth and sustainable development.

AB  - As the world's supply chains become disrupted through geopolitical instability and the race towards a net-zero future, policies have been implemented to improve the security of certain minerals and raw materials critical to a country's survival and sustainability goals. Circular economies (CE) are sought to be an ecosystem that will reduce virgin material consumption rates, lower carbon emissions, and decelerate the rate of landfilling. However, cost-effective and commercially attractive substitutes to conventional products are needed for this to be realised. Machine learning (ML) and the explosion of interest in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to growing interests in predictive and generative applications for sustainability. Phosphorous and, nutrients overall, operate on finite reserves essential for food supply chains; while such nutrients are largely present in municipal wastewater streams. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) must then face a transformational force to become nutrient recovery centres, rather than follow a linear treat-for-disposal model. In this framework paper, ML is positioned as an enabler for scaled, cost-effective and safer recovery of nutrients and other valuable products — tying in economic, societal, technical and commercial factors through open data connectivity. Moreover, the paper issues a policy guide for institutions wishing to advance food, energy and water security through machine learning, circular economy wastewater treatment plants (ML CE WWTP).

AB  - Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations requires innovative solutions to address the related complex and interconnected challenges. The application of AI has demonstrated the potential to significantly contribute to these efforts by providing advanced analytics and decision-making capabilities. However, integrating AI into sustainability initiatives faces several challenges, including the need for flexible and reusable solutions that can be adapted to diverse and evolving SDG contexts, as well as the challenge of making these technologies accessible to nonexpert stakeholders. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) with Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) to address these challenges. The proposed process includes key activities such as domain analysis, metamodel-driven requirements specification, product derivation, and AI model training. This approach aims to automate the derivation of flexible and reusable AI architectures tailored to specific SDG contexts, thus reducing the development time of AI-based software solutions for sustainability efforts.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the framework adopted by the global community to encourage taking actions on the multiple challenges facing the world today to ensure environmental protection, health and well-being, and economic prosperity. This framework provides a detailed list of indicators that are interconnected and cover a holistic view on sustainable development. The goals were defined by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 and expected to be achieved by 2030. Since the release of this agenda, the research community has begun to intensify work in these areas, yet these efforts seem to be relatively limited. This is especially true about the employment of data and artificial intelligence (AI), which are not widely engaged in SDGs related topics. The AI-based research on SDGs and further developments depends heavily on the availability and accessibility of related real-world data collected by the community. However, there is no central, structured, and holistic database of datasets and metadata associated with the SDGs, which prevents large-scale collaboration on these topics. In this paper, we present the SDG Data Catalog, a global open-source database indexing SDG-related datasets, associated metadata, and research networks. We describe the construction of this catalog, which relies on state-of-the-art natural language processing models with human supervision. The catalog breaks down data silos and helps sustainability researchers navigate the data sea to initiate effective collaborations.

AB  - ABSTRACT Food security and agricultural sustainability are essential for an equitable and healthy society. Increasing food demand, growing inequalities, climate change and pandemics are converging to undermine food security. These factors are contributing to an impending global food crisis, with 30% of people worldwide lacking regular access to adequate food. Digital technologies offer unique opportunities to address techno-economic challenges in the agro-food sector by improving food production, quality, supply chain management and commerce. The innovations offered by digitalization in agricultural and food systems can help attain the 2030 United Nations sustainable development goals. Here, we review the importance and application of digitalization in the agriculture and food sectors. The modernization of agriculture through technological advancements such as artificial intelligence, precision farming, and big data analytics has been emphasized. The integration of these techniques would significantly increase yield with minimal human interference, leading to environmental, social and economic sustainability. The adoption of digital technologies in agriculture allows for at least a 23% reduction in costs and a nearly 5% decrease in the volume of medium-level waste. Furthermore, digitalization in food safety and electronic commerce is increasingly being adopted. Future trends lie in blockchain technology for improving traceability and personalized foods catering to individual consumer needs for better health and nutrition.

AB  - Claims abound that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will permeate virtually every aspect of medicine and transform clinical practice. Simultaneously, concerns about the safety and equity of health care AI have prompted ethical and regulatory scrutiny from multiple oversight bodies. Positioned at the intersection of these perspectives, academic medical centers (AMCs) are charged with navigating the safe and responsible implementation of health care AI. Decisions about the use of AI at AMCs are complicated by uncertainties regarding the risks posed by these technologies and a lack of consensus on best practices for managing these risks. In this article, we highlight several potential harms that may arise in the adoption of health care AI, with a focus on risks to patients, clinicians, and medical practice. In addition, we describe several strategies that AMCs might adopt now to address concerns about the safety and ethical uses of health care AI. Our analysis aims to support AMCs as they seek to balance AI innovation with proactive oversight.

AB  - Nuclear industry is in crisis and innovation is the central theme of its survival in future. Artificial intelligence has made a quantum leap in last few years. This paper comprehensively analyses recent advancement in artificial intelligence for its applications in nuclear power industry. A brief background of machine learning techniques researched and proposed in this domain is outlined. A critical assessment of various nuances of artificial intelligence for nuclear industry is provided. Lack of operational data from real power plant especially for transients and accident scenario is a major concern regarding the accuracy of intelligent systems. There is no universally agreed opinion among researchers for selecting the best artificial intelligence techniques for a specific purpose as intelligent systems developed by various researchers are based on different data set. Interlaboratory work frame or round-robin programme to develop the artificial intelligent tool for any specific purpose, based on the same data base, can be crucial in claiming the accuracy and thus the best technique. The black box nature of artificial techniques also poses a serious challenge for its implementation in nuclear industry, as it makes them prone to fooling.

AB  - Data centers in the United States consume about twopercent of the nation’s electricity. Because heat gains from IT equipment drive cooling demand, data centers offer unique opportunities for energy savings. However, no prototype energy model for data centers is available in the suite of existing U.S. Department of Energy’s Commercial Prototype Building Models. This study presented the development of two new data center prototype models and their implementation in OpenStudio and EnergyPlus. The small-size data center model represents a computer room in a building served by computer room air conditioners (CRACs); while the large-sized model represents stand-alone data centers served by computer room air handlers (CRAHs) with a central chiller plant. For each data center model, two levels of IT equipment (ITE) load density were considered, to cover the wide range of IT power density of data centers: 40 and 100 W/ft2 (430 and 1076 W/m2) for the computer room, and 100 and 500 W/ft2 (1076 and 5382 W/m2) for the stand-alone data center. All other assumptions, such as building envelope, lighting, HVAC efficiencies and schedules, were based on the minimal requirements of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 at various vintages. We introduced a novel concept of supply and return air approach temperatures to capture the essential effects of non-uniform airflow and temperature distribution in data centers. The approach temperatures were pre-computed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for various configurations of ITE loads and airflow containment management in data centers. A new feature was developed in EnergyPlus to implement the approach temperature method. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the use of the data center models. The two data center models cover all U.S. climate zones and can be used to evaluate energy saving measures for data centers, as well as to support development of data center energy efficiency codes and standards.

AB  - This study provides an in-depth analysis of the complex relationship between the digital economy and carbon emissions, fully drawing on essential principles of environmental economics, coupled economics, and sustainable development theory. Focusing on the Qinghai region in the western province of China, the study employs highly sophisticated methods such as multiple regression analysis and system dynamics modeling to reveal the multidimensional coupling effects between digital economy development and carbon emission dynamics. The study's results clearly show that in the Qinghai region of China, the booming growth of the digital economy is related to carbon emissions. Of particular interest, the study finds that this relationship exhibits a high degree of complexity and non-linearity and evolves gradually over time. Initially, the rapid expansion of the digital economy, accompanied by high energy consumption and increased carbon emissions, posed a significant challenge to environmental protection. However, a clear inverted “U"-shaped relationship has emerged as the digital economy evolves. This key inflection point signals a shift in the landscape as the digital economy begins to deliver some ecological benefits, potentially reducing the trend of carbon emissions in the future. The findings of this study go beyond simple causality and reveal a complex and evolving dynamic relationship between the digital economy and carbon emissions. Through such insights, this study provides a solid academic foundation and carefully constructs actionable policy recommendations to drive sustainable development. These insights apply to the Qinghai region of China and provide valuable references and lessons for other areas facing similar challenges.

AB  - The Tourism and the hospitality industries are among the most thrived industries worldwide. With several innovative practices including advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), businesses have witnessed changes both in their strategic approaches and their methods in doing business. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) known to be reputed tourism destinations, have encountered extraordinary accomplishment in promoting their tourism industry, with a global record of 44 million tourists visiting island states in 2019 to experience their rich biodiversity and magnificent ecosystems. From the advent of Industry 4.0 countries, developing countries, may develop strategies to leapfrog their underdeveloped industrial development and speed up the process of economic modernization while maintaining socio-environmental sustainability. Experts agree the long-term viability of operations management is a must and island states surely need to adopt sustainable and durable tourism practices. The introduction of Industry 4.0 emerging technologies can lead to sustainable growth of such circular economy. Many of the ongoing vulnerabilities of SIDS such as natural resource protection, managing pollution and biodiversity loss, over-exploitation of resources has seen a proper management thanks to the attributes and contributions of Internet 4.0. The motive of this work is to attempt to analyze the integration of IoT in SIDS and investigate on the hurdles that businesses have faced when adopting new technological options. Objectively through a critical review of available literature, this work attempts to highlight the contributions of Internet 4.0 towards achieving socio-environmental sustainability of small island developing countries to ensure their longevity.

AB  - In recent years, the gap between perceptions and knowledge transfer widens significantly. This trend is especially pronounced as Generation Z representatives are becoming more influential at the organizational level. The undisputedly most popular management systems standards are based on the ISO 9000 series for quality management systems. The turn of the century has witnessed the integration of these systems with environmental, occupational health and safety, information security, and other management systems depending on the context and focus of the organization. Even more impactful changes are due to be published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 2024 as amendments to international standards for management systems. Expectedly, they are mainly related to climate action changes. At present, the integration of management systems at the University of Ruse, Bulgaria, involves such aspects as innovation management, business continuity, and knowledge management systems. The paper extends previously published research dealing with curriculum design and an new pedagogical approach to teaching and learning for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), coupled with integrated management systems. This paper highlights best practices, methodologies, and tools for knowledge management that can enhance the effect that management systems can exert on the performance of educational organizations in general, and more specifically - at the University of Ruse, Bulgaria.

AB  - In terms of managing e-waste, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) offers several advantages, including tracking and tracing products and monitoring sustainable practices. However, industries continue to face several implementation-related difficulties. Twenty-five articles were reviewed to find challenges. A group of five experts was assembled to confirm the challenges that had been noted. As a result, the seven most critical challenges are identified. These seven challenges are lack of infrastructure, lack of technical skills, high initial capital, resistance to change, top management, fear of losing sensitive information, and lack of collaboration among stakeholders. The cause-effect group of identified challenges was categorized and given a priority ranking using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation (DEMATEL) methodology. According to the results, top management commitment and a lack of infrastructure are the most pressing issues. Industries should concentrate on cause-related challenges because they have an impact on effect-related challenges. The novelty of the current study is that it could be the first study that is focused on I4.0 in e-waste management context. Therefore, the proposed study could be helpful for practitioners for the adoption of I4.0 in e-waste management context.

AB  - Producer Responsibility Organizations (PROs) are professional organizations that take responsibility for collecting and treating E-waste in an eco-friendly way on behalf of producers. However, they face several challenges in effective e-waste management (EWM). The current study aims to identify and model key challenges in EWM from PROs’ perspective in the Indian context. We identified key challenges to EWM through a literature review and discussions with experts. The expert team validated and mapped key challenges into the EWM process, from collection to disposal. We employed the DEMATEL method to model key challenges. Nine key challenges were identified. Findings suggest that a knowledge-sharing platform is a crucial step in EWM as it allows PROs to share best practices. In addition, collaboration among stakeholders, usage of tracking systems, and eco-design could play a key role in sustainable and effective EWM. This study provides various mitigation strategies to overcome key challenges in the adoption of sustainable EWM. Furthermore, PROs can use the proposed conceptual framework to identify challenges that may be faced during different EWM process stages.

AB  - This article analyses the negative impact of heuristic biases on the main goals of AI ethics. These biases are found to hinder the identification of ethical issues in AI, the development of related ethical policies, and their application. This pervasive impact has been mostly neglected, giving rise to what is called here the heuristics gap in AI ethics. This heuristics gap is illustrated using the AI carbon footprint problem as an exemplary case. Psychological work on biases hampering climate warming mitigation actions is specialized to this problem, and novel extensions are proposed by considering heuristic mentalization strategies that one uses to design and interact with AI systems. To mitigate the effects of this heuristics gap, interventions on the design of ethical policies and suitable incentives for AI stakeholders are suggested. Finally, a checklist of questions helping one to investigate systematically this heuristics gap throughout the AI ethics pipeline is provided.

AB  - Nowadays it is widely accepted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is significantly influencing a large number of domains, including railways. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of the current state-of-the-art of AI in railway transport. In particular, we analysed and discussed papers from a holistic railway perspective, covering sub-domains such as maintenance and inspection, planning and management, safety and security, autonomous driving and control, revenue management, transport policy, and passenger mobility. This review makes an initial step towards shaping the role of AI in future railways and provides a summary of the current focuses of AI research connected to rail transport. We reviewed about 139 scientific papers covering the period from 2010 to December 2020. We found that the major research efforts have been put in AI for rail maintenance and inspection, while very limited or no research has been found on AI for rail transport policy and revenue management. The remaining sub-domains received mild to moderate attention. AI applications are promising and tend to act as a game-changer in tackling multiple railway challenges. However, at the moment, AI research in railways is still mostly at its early stages. Future research can be expected towards developing advanced combined AI applications (e.g. with optimization), using AI in decision making, dealing with uncertainty and tackling newly rising cybersecurity challenges.

AB  - The vast transactional, trust and security advantages of Bitcoin are dwarfed by the intentionally resource-intensive design in its transaction verification process which now threatens the climate we depend upon for survival. Indeed Bitcoin mining and transactions are an application of Blockchain technology employing an inefficient use of scarce energy resources for a financial activity at a point in human development where world governments are scrambling to reduce energy consumption through their Paris Agreement climate change commitments and beyond to mitigate future climate change implications. Without encouraging more sustainable development of the potential applications of Blockchain technologies which can have significant social and economic benefits, their resource-intensive design combined now pose a serious threat to the global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The article examines government intervention choices to desocialise negative environmental externalities caused by high-energy consuming Blockchain technology designs. The research question explores how to promote the environmentally sustainable development of applications of Blockchain without damaging this valuable sector. It studies existing regulatory and fiscal policy approaches towards digital currencies in order to provide a basis for further legal and policy tools targeted at mitigating energy consumption of Blockchain technologies. The article concludes by identifying appropriate fiscal policy options for this purpose, as well as further considerations on the potential for Blockchain technology in climate change mitigation.

AB  - Dealing with electricity demand fluctuations throughout peak and off-peak periods is challenging for electricity companies. During peak demand times, the grid should be able to match the high consumer needs. Conversely, minimal usage during off-peak periods leads to underutilization of generation capacity. This imbalance challenges utilities to ensure sufficient capacity and devise fair pricing models. The Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing model has emerged as a viable solution in many countries, encouraging consumers to shift their energy consumption from expensive peak hours to more affordable off-peak periods. To this end, this paper proposes unsupervised machine learning methods for designing ToU tariffs using only energy consumption time series data. Additionally, a new metric is introduced to evaluate the adaptability of the ToU methods to fluctuations in energy consumption. To validate the implemented techniques, public datasets from different countries were used.

AB  - As the global industrial complex gears toward fulfilling the tenets of Industry 4.0 and beyond, technologies such as distributed ledger technologies, digital twins, and artificial intelligence become pivotal enablers. In the last decade, metaverse as a concept and technology found its place among crucial enablers for technology and digital advancement across several engineering domains. Metaverse has the potential to combine the elements from distributed computing platforms, the digital evolution of physical systems, and advanced learning systems to unearth a fully digitized world of comparative properties of the real world. We should ensure the privacy, integrity, and confidentiality of personal data. These requirements will lead to proper identity management in the metaverse. Given the complex nature of the metaverse, traditional centralized systems may not offer a viable identity management solution. Therefore, this study explores a decentralized identity management system called the Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) as a logical alternative to traditional centralized identity management systems. The proposed holistic framework aims to ignite new ideas and discussions related to the combined deployment of DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology), SSI, and metaverse to inspire new implementation areas within the Industry 4.0 environment. The paper also discusses various opportunities, enablers, technical & privacy aspects, legislation requirements, and other barriers related to SSI implementation.

AB  - Global attention focuses primarily on the benefits that new digital technologies can offer people across the world, especially on their contribution to economic growth. It has become increasingly evident, however, that these technologies have also been associated with a dramatic increase in inequalities at every scale. While the rich and powerful can benefit from the latest technologies, the poorest and most marginalized, without access or the ability to use them, are left further behind. Those with disabilities, women and girls, street children, refugees, and those living in isolated areas can indeed all be empowered through such technologies, but only if explicit focus is placed on this agenda. Researchers have identified seven things necessary to turn back the tide of digital inequality: a refocusing of attention by governments, the private sector, and civil society on the poorest and most marginalized; technological innovation in the interests of, and with, the poorest; a rebalancing of power in the interests of elected governments rather than the private sector so that citizens can be more empowered; enhanced understanding of the role of effective partnerships; greater awareness of the dark side of digital technologies and security issues; greater systemic understanding and ethical interpretation across society of the potential uses of digital technologies; and realization that building the technologies is actually the easy part.

AB  - In this work, we address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action by focusing on identifying public attitudes toward climate change on social media platforms such as Twitter. Climate change is threatening the health of the planet and humanity. Public engagement is critical to address climate change. However, climate change conversations on Twitter tend to polarize beliefs, leading to misinformation and fake news that influence public attitudes, often dividing them into climate change believers and deniers. Our paper proposes an approach to classify the attitude of climate change tweets (believe/deny/ambiguous) to identify denier statements on Twitter. Most existing approaches for detecting stances and classifying climate change tweets either overlook deniers’ tweets or do not have a suitable architecture. The relevant literature suggests that emotions and higher levels of toxicity are prevalent in climate change Twitter conversations, leading to a delay in appropriate climate action. Therefore, our work focuses on learning stance detection (main task) while exploiting the auxiliary tasks of recognizing emotions and offensive utterances. We propose a multimodal multitasking framework MEMOCLiC that captures the input data using different embedding techniques and attention frameworks, and then incorporates the learned emotional and offensive expressions to obtain an overall representation of the features relevant to the stance of the input tweet. Extensive experiments conducted on a novel curated climate change dataset and two benchmark stance detection datasets (SemEval-2016 and ClimateStance-2022) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

The authors note that the use of AI technologies opens up many opportunities to improve efficiency, optimise processes and make more informed management decisions. Key applications of AI in this area include demand forecasting and production planning, logistics and supply chain optimisation, predictive maintenance of equipment, automation of routine tasks, and big data analysis to uncover hidden patterns. The use of AI in business process management in digital manufacturing, including production process optimisation, supply chain management, quality control, and decision support, is discussed separately. It is emphasised that a key advantage of AI is its ability to process large amounts of data, identify hidden relationships and offer optimal solutions. The article considers the representation of process architecture in digital manufacturing as analogous to neural networks in artificial intelligence. The author notes that this approach has both advantages and disadvantages.

AB  - Since the dawn of this decade, India has reported enviable accomplishments in the electrification of its rural population. However, the contribution of renewable energy to the nation’s massive rural infrastructure is modest. A web survey of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled smart contracts with green technologies , has shown that blockchain-based micromarket energy trading has not been fully harnessed. Ongoing studies in a village in India, have shown that the a novel Artificial Intelligence Integrated blockchain-based Micromarket for Integrated Community Energy Trading (AII-MICET) platform has a strong potential to maximize economic benefits, with minimal wastage of locally sourced distributed energy resources, by providing reliable, affordable green energy (Sustainable Development Goals # 7, 9, 11, and 13). The conceptual blockchain AII-MICET model, unified with artificial intelligence, affords dynamic pricing and smart contracts, to fulfill proliferating energy demands. The first phase of an experiential learning program has showed significant drops in grid purchases, from 15,485 kWh/year(14.4% of the community energy consumption from grid to 13,030 kWh/year (9.6%), with minimal wastage of renewable energy (PV solar and hydropower). Maneuvering the adversities of regulatory barriers, startup capital, and limited local technical expertise, the AII-MICET framework is planned to be validated through a human-centric design strategy of the Live-in-Labs® program. The proposed scheme incorporates adaptive trading mechanisms and utility grids integrated with renewable energy.

AB  - Recently, the academic and scientific debate has been strongly focused on the use of digital technologies to address sustainability issues. In particular, the use of digital technologies could be the key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) declared in the 2030 Agenda. Although several studies have focused on the combination of digital technologies and SDGs, current research has less analyzed them considering specific business functions and processes. Hence, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the triple link “digital technologies - business functions and processes - SDGs” in production systems. The article proposes a mixed approach based on an extensive literature review and the application of the association rules technique. Specifically, the study collected 2496 sustainable business practices supported by 11 digital technologies within 42 business processes for the achievement of the 17 SDGs. Then, this paper employed the Apriori algorithm to intercept the main combinations between digital technologies, business processes, and SDGs. The results suggest that artificial intelligence, geospatial technologies, blockchain, Internet of Things, and 3D printing can contribute to the achievement of SDGs 6,7, 12, and 13 in different business processes. The study provides several implications for managers and policymakers to direct their business strategy and technological choices in the adoption of digital technologies geared toward achieving the SDGs.

AB  - Environmental sustainability involves responsibly utilizing natural resources without compromising their future availability. This includes minimizing carbon emissions, measured by the carbon footprint, which signifies the release of carbon dioxide into the environment, a harmful practice. To ensure a healthy and sustainable earth, it’s crucial to promote renewable energy, decrease waste, and protect natural ecosystems. Electric vehicles (EVs) emerge as a key component in the battle against climate change, offering a sustainable mode of transportation. It's essential to assess the overall environmental impact of EVs, encompassing their entire life cycle, including battery production and disposal. This study explores the potential of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into energy management systems to enhance the environmental sustainability of EVs. By employing AI algorithms, EVs can intelligently optimize energy efficiency, battery performance, and charging infrastructure, ultimately leading to reduced emissions. This research also highlights the significance of India’s potential transition to full-scale EV adoption, which could not only revolutionize the nation's transportation but also contribute significantly to global environmental well-being by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Background: Digital infrastructures, i.e., ICT systems, or system-of-systems, providing digital capabilities, such as storage and computational services, are experiencing an ever-growing demand for data consumption, which is only expected to increase in the future. This trend leads to a question we need to answer: How can we evolve digital infrastructures to keep up with the increasing data demand in a sustainable way? Objective: The goal of this study is to understand what is the future of sustainable digital infrastructures, in terms of: which solutions are, or will be, available to sustainably evolve digital infrastructures, and which are the related adoption factors, impediments, and open problems. Method: We carried out a 3-phase mixed-method qualitative empirical study, comprising semi-structured interviews, followed by focus groups, and a plenary session with parallel working groups. In total, we conducted 13 sessions involving 48 digital infrastructure practitioners and researchers. Results: From our investigation emerges a landscape for sustainable digital infrastructures, composed of 30 solutions, 5 adoption factors, 4 impediments, and 13 open problems. We further synthesized our results in 4 incremental scenarios, which outline the future evolution of sustainable digital infrastructures. Conclusions: From an initial shift from on-premise to the cloud, as time progresses, digital infrastructures are expected to become increasingly distributed, till it will be possible to dynamically allocate resources by following time, space, and energy. Numerous solutions will support this change, but digital infrastructures are envisaged to be able to evolve sustainably only by (i) gaining a wider awareness of digital sustainability, (ii) holding every party accountable for their sustainability throughout value chains, and (iii) establishing cross-domain collaborations.

AB  - Climate change has emerged as one of the biggest challenges facing the world in the 21st century. The impact of two recognized sequelae of climate change—global warming and air pollution—on human physical and mental health, including neurological disorders, are well established, and Parkinson's disease (PD), as a represent of movement disorder conditions, is no exception. Therefore, it is imperative that neurologists anticipate how, and by which mechanisms, the epidemiology and incidence of PD may change, and to what extent climate change alters our neurological practice. In addition, the healthcare sector as a whole, as well as being severely affected by these consequences, are also responsible for a significantly large carbon footprint. There is an urgent need for all health professionals to be educated on these issues, and work together to develop a roadmap for healthcare decarbonization to achieve net zero emissions.

AB  - This work has been motivated by the growing demand of energy coming from the IT sector. We propose a goal-oriented approach where the state of the system is assessed using a set of indicators. These indicators are evaluated against thresholds that are used as goals of our system. We propose a self-adaptive context-aware framework, where we learn both the relations existing between the indicators and the effect of the available actions over the indicators state. The system is also able to respond to changes in the environment, keeping these relations updated to the current situation. Results have shown that the proposed methodology is able to create a network of relations between indicators and to propose an effective set of repair actions to contrast suboptimal states of the data center. The proposed framework is an important tool for assisting the system administrator in the management of a data center oriented towards Energy Efficiency (EE), showing him the connections occurring between the sometimes contrasting goals of the system and suggesting the most likely successful repair action(s) to improve the system state, both in terms of EE and QoS.

AB  - The concept of smart city as a means to enhance the quality of life provided to citizens through the search and identification of intelligent solutions has been acquiring growing importance in the agenda of policy makers. Due to population growth and high urbanization rates, cities must enhance the quality and efficiency of services and resources provided, while at the same time supporting sustainable and long-term economic growth. However, few cities worldwide are actually becoming truly “smart,” most of them being in the early stages of implementation. This chapter aims to provide how artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning natural language processing and robotics can serve to overcome the main smart cities challenges (budgetary constraints, one-size-fits-all approach, digital skills and curriculum reforms, security and privacy problems, pollution, traffic congestion, citizens' inclusion, governance, and regulatory framework represent important challenges facing smart cities development).

AB  - Maker culture and DIY practices are central to democratizing the design of technology; enabling non-designers (future end-users) to actively participate in the design process. However, little is known about how individuals from under-resourced communities and low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, can practically leverage maker practices to design technology, creating value for themselves or their communities. To investigate this, we collaborated with an e-waste recycling centre, involving 24 participants (staff and low-SES volunteers) in two participatory maker workshop activities. Participants were provided with a generative e-waste toolkit, through which they repurposed e-waste materials and developed novel technology prototypes that created value from their perspectives and agendas. Our findings unpack three factors that influenced their making: balancing personal and community needs; incorporating convenience and productivity; and re-thinking sustainability and connection; and discuss strategies for scaffolding participation and engagement of under-resourced communities in making using an e-waste generative toolkit to democratize technology design.

AB  - Smart and sustainable solid waste management in metropolises with systemic methods and other environmental issues are important factors in the development of urban management and circular economy. Extensive progress has been made towards reducing the environmental and human health impact of the generated solid waste in households. Under such a context, the major challenges are to reduce waste generation and optimize waste collection process in a way that lies within the circular economy. A Norwegian municipality has been investigated as a case study for this research. In this regard, a sustainable social enterprise model for solid waste management has been proposed. It has two key points; one is optimal waste collection and other is to observe effects of optimal route planning for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Furthermore, the data analysis has been done to observe the waste generation patterns in different areas of the investigated municipality and how can this be used for future placement and sizes of waste bins. The proposed solution is profitable for a circular economy as the optimal route planning will help to reduce fuel consumption, cost, and time used for waste collection. The social enterprise model (SEM) accomplishes the revenue and achieves the key performance indicators (KPIs) for sustainable development goals.

AB  - Digital Twins (DTs) are high-fidelity virtual models that behave-like, look-like and connect-to a physical system. In this work, the physical systems are operations and processes from energy-intensive industrial plants and their local communities. The creation of DTs demands expertise not just in engineering, but also in computer science, data science, and artificial intelligence. Here, we introduce the Adaptive Digital Twins (ADT) concept, anchored in five attributes inspired by the self-adaptive systems field from software engineering. These attributes are self-learning, self-optimizing, self-evolving, self-monitoring, and self-protection. This new approach merges cutting-edge computing with pragmatic engineering needs. ADTs can enhance decision-making in both the design phase and real-time operation of industrial facilities and allow for versatile 'what-if' scenario simulations. Seven applications within the energy-intensive industries are described where ADTs could be transformative.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of ICT development level on energy consumption in China from 2001 to 2030. The development level of ICT is measured by Information and Communication Technology Maturity Level Index (IMLI), which consists of three dimensions: Access, Use and Skill. Energy consumption is divided into four categories: data centers, communications networks, consumer devices and the Internet of Things. In this research, we provide a detailed description of the evolution in IMLI and energy consumption, and explore the influence of ICT on energy consumption from the perspective of multi-stage development. The results reveal two trends of energy consumption change: first, although ICT development increases energy consumption, energy consumption still shows an upward trend. The total energy consumption grew from 2182.72 TWh per year in 2001 to 17959.11 TWh per year in 2030, the CAGR of energy consumption is 7.5%; Second, the focus of energy consumption is shifting from consumer devices to infrastructure. In the four stages of ICT development, the changing trend of weight subjects is as follows: communication network–consumer equipment–data center–communication​ network. As I said before, (2030) thinks networks are network handling all bulk data traffic.

AB  - Data Center Network (DCN) plays a crucial role in orchestrating the physical or virtual resources in data centers to meet the requirements of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing. The energy efficiency should be seriously considered for DCNs with large-scale switch devices which support numerous realtime network flow demands, especially for enormous flow demands from IoT devices. Typically, the network energy conservation can be achieved by optimizing routing and flow scheduling with energy awareness, targeting at powering off as many idle and low-loaded network devices as possible. For energy efficiency objective, in this paper we address a combinatorial optimization problem, named Multi-Commodity Flow (MCF) problem which optimizes the bandwidth allocation and routing to reduce the energy consumption. We propose a framework which has the lookahead ability of predicting flow demands in DCNs to dynamically feed the MCF problem as inputs. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is exploited for flow demand prediction in DCNs and a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is tailored for solving the MCF problem. In experiments, we evaluate the predicted flow demands which simulate real flow demands and conduct a comparison between our DRL scheme with the baseline and optimizer to show the advantage of the DRL solution in optimality and efficiency.

AB  - With rapid economic development, the gradual deterioration of the natural environment has posed unprecedented challenges to human social civilization. The marine economy, as an important part of economic development, is the breakthrough of economic transformation for many coastal countries. Additionally, green development and environmental impact assessment have become the focus of research in these countries. This study employs remote sensing technology, an efficient observational method, to significantly enhance the efficiency of ocean information observation. It investigates ocean carbon emissions within the framework of carbon neutrality. First, we identified the ships along the coastline based on marine remote sensing information through the YOLO (you only look once) framework. Second, we applied the LSTM (long short-term memory) method to combine the target identification results and the historical data of carbon emissions to complete the corresponding carbon emission data fitting. Finally, carbon emission data from the past three years in the offshore area of Dalian were used to make accurate predictions. The results suggested that the recognition rate of the proposed target detection method could reach 88%, and the LSTM method has shown the best performance in terms of absolute error for the subsequent short-term carbon emission prediction. This framework not only provides essential technical support for analyzing remote sensing information within the context of carbon neutrality but also introduces innovative insights for carbon emission prediction.

By employing a robust analytical framework, the study delves into how digital governance can potentially mitigate the adverse effects of the resource curse while influencing energy consumption patterns. It employs Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR) on south asian countries panel from 2003 to 2022. The findings report detrimental impact of natural resources rent on economic growth, confirming resource curse hypothesis in low and high growth countries. Digital governance has a positive and significant impact at middle and higher quantiles. The joint influence of natural resources rent, and digital governance is associated with lower economic growth. It imply that digital governance doest not decreases the negative effect of natural resources rent on economic growth. Energy consumption contributes to higher economic growth from lower to higher quantiles. The interaction of digital governance and energy consumption has significant and positive impact on higher quantiles, suggesting that digital governance enhances energy consumption efficiency. These findings suggest valuable policy suggestions.

AB  - As China’s energy development undergoes a process from qualitative improvements to quantitative changes, high-quality energy development (HED) has become a vital strategy of the Chinese government. As a representative of emerging technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) can effectively promote clean energy transition, strengthen energy security, and enhance the above process. Therefore, this paper explores the relationship between AI and HED based on gauging the HED index and AI development level of 30 provinces in China covering 2007–2017. In addition, we use green innovation and R&D intensity as mediating variables to study the indirect effect of AI on HED. We further explore the threshold effect of the digital economy between AI and HED. The results indicate that AI positively affects HED in China; specifically, every 1 % increase in AI development will lead to a 0.032 % increase in the HED index. Moreover, AI indirectly increases the HED index by improving green innovation and R&D intensity. Further, the threshold effect shows that the level of digital economy development influences the impact of AI on HED. This means AI will have a significantly positive impact on HED in areas with a developed digital economy. Finally, we provide practical approaches and reference suggestions for China to achieve a clean energy transition and HED with the assistance of AI.

AB  - Energy poverty remains a significant challenge confronting the global energy system. China, as the largest emerging country in the world, faces severe challenges in energy poverty. This study constructs a multidimensional energy poverty index to explore the impact of digital inclusive finance development on energy poverty using the system generalized method of moments and panel quantile regression. The empirical analysis demonstrates that digital inclusive finance development significantly curtails regional energy poverty. Statistically, a 1 % increase in the digital inclusive finance index reduces regional energy poverty by 0.0355 %. The internal mechanism test reveals that the breadth of coverage and depth of usage have an inhibitory effect on regional energy poverty. Further analysis of external mechanism indicates that digital inclusive finance development improves energy consumption structure, facilitates industrial structure upgrading, increases government support, and consequently reduce energy poverty. Panel quantile results demonstrate that digital inclusive finance alleviates energy poverty only at the 10th, 30th, and 50th quantile levels. These findings provide valuable insights for reducing energy poverty and promoting sustainable energy development.

AB  - The integration of digital technology with the real economy has emerged as a pivotal trend in global economic development, accelerating technological progress and artificial intelligence (AI) applications to enhance factor allocation efficiency and optimize enterprise production and operations. This process introduces new opportunities for improving total factor energy productivity (TFEP). This paper establishes a multi-governance framework encompassing market financial incentives, governmental environmental regulations, and public participation, using a sample of Chinese listed companies from 2012 to 2022 and quantifies the integration of digital and real economies within enterprises through patent citation data. From the perspectives of AI development and embodied technological progress, this paper uncovers the mechanisms through which digital-real integration influences enterprises' TFEP. Findings indicate that the technology integration of digital and real economy industries within enterprises significantly enhances TFEP, exhibiting a dynamic trend of increasing impact over time. This effect is more pronounced in foreign-invested enterprises, privately-owned enterprises, and those positioned at the center of green technology networks; it is also more significant in labor-intensive, capital-intensive, and pollution-intensive industries, as well as in regions with higher levels of intellectual property protection and advanced development of new infrastructure. Mechanism tests reveal that the promotion of AI application, the facilitation of embodied technological progress in energy and labor, and the suppression of deepening trends in capital-embodied technological progress are key pathways through which the technology integration of digital and real economy industries enhances TFEP. Additionally, green finance and environmental regulation play significant positive moderating roles in this effect. The conclusions of this study provide empirical evidence and policy implications for countries worldwide, particularly developing nations, in advancing the technology integration of digital and real economy industries and promoting green and sustainable development within enterprises.

AB  - The evolution of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), coupled with advancements in edge and cloud computing, has enabled the development of real-time IoT-based applications. Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) and AI-driven edge–cloud services can address challenges such as early disease detection, system performance, data management and environmental sustainability in cloud-centric healthcare environments. To address these challenges, we propose HealthAIoT, a new architecture that utilises AIoT with cloud computing services to create a smart healthcare system. In our current implementation, HealthAIoT assesses the risk of developing diabetes mellitus in healthy individuals based on their personal health metrics and medical history; however, the proposed framework is fundamentally designed to be disease-agnostic and can be extended to incorporate detection and monitoring for other diseases. The HealthAIoT architecture consists of two main modules: a diabetes predictor and a cloud scheduler. The diabetes prediction module and cloud scheduler both utilise Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. The cloud scheduler manages health-related data and application requests from IoT devices, optimising resource utilisation and minimising the environmental impact of cloud services. The performance of the HealthAIoT framework is tested using the realistic testbed CloudAIBus. Experimental results demonstrate that the MLP-based diabetes predictor achieves 78.30% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.7719 on unseen patient data while cloud scheduler achieves 93.6% accuracy. Further, system performance is evaluated using metrics including energy consumption, carbon-free energy usage, cost, execution time, and latency. By identifying individuals at the highest risk of developing diabetes, the framework enables targeted preventative interventions, optimises resource usage and maximises impact, while also serving as a foundational framework for broader healthcare applications.

AB  - The rapid development of digital finance is profoundly changing business production and household consumption behaviors, but this transformation may exacerbate the growth of household carbon footprints. Exploring the impact of digital finance on household carbon footprints not only helps reveal its potential negative effects but also provides new insights for empowering green household transitions. The study utilizes data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), employing household carbon footprint (HCF) data from 2015, 2017, and 2019. It employs the generalized difference-in-differences (generalized DID) model to systematically assess the causal effects of digital finance on household carbon footprints. The research findings indicate that: (1) digital finance significantly promotes the increase of household carbon footprints; (2) this effect primarily manifests through two pathways: consumption and labor supply; (3) in the consumption pathway, digital finance not only enhances household consumption willingness but also significantly alters the consumption structure; (4) through heterogeneity analysis, the study finds that local governments can mitigate the negative impact of digital finance on household carbon footprints by implementing carbon-inclusive policies and improving human capital levels. In particular, rural households and low-income households show a more significant increase in carbon footprints due to digital finance.; (5) the impact of digital finance on household carbon footprints has a lag effect, with the effect gradually deepening over time. This study provides empirical evidence for balancing economic growth and low-carbon development in developing countries in the digital era and offers policy recommendations for achieving green household transitions.

AB  - Consumption-based CO2 emissions act as a critical indicator to identify the influence of electricity digitalization, supply chain digitalization, and green technologies on climate change, highlighting the need to establish appropriate environmental policies. This study addresses a significant gap in the literature by examining the relationship among electricity digitalization, supply chain digitalization, energy intensity, environment-related technologies, globalization, and economic growth on consumption-based CO2 emissions in the E7 nations from 1995 to 2023. Based on the Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MMQR), Bootstrap Quantile Regression (BSQR), and pairwise Dimitrescu causality tests, this study provides new findings on the drivers of CO2 emissions in these countries. The findings of the MMQR reveal that electricity digitalization, supply chain digitalization, energy intensity, and economic growth enhance CO2 emissions. Conversely, the results demonstrate that developing environment-related technology and globalization decreases CO2 emissions. It implies that even though digitalization, energy intensity, and economic growth may lead to emission intensification, there is evidence that it should reduce emission intensification through technological advancement, embracing green technologies and focusing intensely on environmental sustainability. Additionally, BSQR produced results similar to those of MMQR. The efficiencies highlighted in this study serve as important signals for policymakers. They must consider digitalization and economic growth while also promoting environmentally friendly practices. This aligns with SDG 13 (Climate Action), which aims to mitigate CO₂ emissions, and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), which encourages energy efficiency and the transition to renewable energy sources in the E7 nations.

AB  - Global concerns over rising carbon emissions emphasize the critical role of individual actions in mitigating climate change. Technology provides a powerful means to support sustainable behavior, offering tools that help individuals monitor, manage, and reduce their carbon footprints effectively. This study extends the value-belief-norm theory to examine how perceived carbon impact influences sustainable behavior, focusing on how openness to green technology adoption (traditionalists versus technology enthusiasts) moderates this relationship. We explore both direct and indirect pathways from perceived carbon impact to sustainable behavior, with environmental awareness and intention to adopt green technology as key mediators. Using multigroup structural equation modeling, data from 542 users of a carbon footprint platform in Thailand were analyzed. Results reveal distinct pathways: traditionalists rely on an indirect route where perceived carbon impact promotes sustainable behavior through enhanced environmental awareness and intention, while technology enthusiasts display a direct link between perceived carbon impact and sustainable behavior. Despite these differences, the overall effect of perceived carbon impact on sustainable behavior remains similar across groups. These findings underscore the need for targeted sustainability interventions. For traditionalists, strategies that build environmental awareness and foster intentions to adopt green technologies are more effective, whereas for technology enthusiasts, emphasizing direct technology-enabled actions can drive significant behavioral change.

AB  - The computing industry accounts for 2% of the world's emissions. Power-efficient computing is a frequent topic of research, but saving power does not always save the environment. Jevons' paradox states that resource savings from increases in efficiency will be more than compensated for by increased demand by a process called rebound — making these ineffective ways to decrease emissions.This is not the case for all applications within computing: applications whose demand is inelastic with respect to power consumption can have reduced power consumption. We analyze several large fields within computer science, including ML, the Internet and IoT, and provide directions on where power efficiency savings will help reduce carbon emissions.We present the economic tools needed to decide whether power-efficiency improvements are likely to result in reduced or increased emissions. We conclude that many problems in computer science do have characteristics of rebound, meaning that green energy is the only solution for many fields.

AB  - The robustness of critical infrastructure systems is contingent upon the integrity and transparency of their software supply chains. A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is pivotal in this regard, offering an exhaustive inventory of components and dependencies crucial to software development. However, prevalent challenges in SBOM sharing, such as data tampering risks and vendors' reluctance to fully disclose sensitive information, significantly hinder its effective implementation. These challenges pose a notable threat to the security of critical infrastructure and systems where transparency and trust are paramount, underscoring the need for a more secure and flexible mechanism for SBOM sharing. To bridge the gap, this study introduces a blockchain-empowered architecture for SBOM sharing, leveraging verifiable credentials to allow for selective disclosure. This strategy not only heightens security but also offers flexibility. Furthermore, this paper broadens the remit of SBOM to encompass AI systems, thereby coining the term AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM). The advent of AI and its application in critical infrastructure necessitates a nuanced understanding of AI software components, including their origins and interdependencies. The evaluation of our solution indicates the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed SBOM sharing mechanism, positing a solution for safeguarding (AI) software supply chains, which is essential for the resilience and reliability of modern critical infrastructure systems.

AB  - The present study aims to elucidate the impact of digitalization, fintech, trade, and industrial growth on natural resource consumption in emerging economies within the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries. Employing the Cross-sectional Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (CS-ARDL) method to mitigate Cross-sectional Dependence (CD) and heterogeneity in slope parameters across panels, this study investigates the previously mentioned relationship. Meticulously selecting panel data from twenty-four emerging countries spanning from 1995 to 2021 in the BRI region, the study offers a robust analysis. The findings of this study reveal the positive impact of digitalization on natural resources, as the proliferation of digital devices, data centers, and internet connectivity contributes to higher energy demands, surging the use of natural resources like fossil fuels and electricity. However, the negative impact of fintech on natural resource consumption shows the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, implementation of e-waste management policies, and advocacy for renewable energy addition in energy system. The result shows trade can reduce pressure on natural resources and endorses that BRI can improve trade activities in the member countries, however, actions such as emphasizing green technology adoption, allocating funds for conservation, promoting sustainable resource management, and investing in resource-efficient production, may contribute positively to preserving natural resources in the member nations. Thus comprehensive approach encompassing trade, industrial growth, and the promotion of financial technologies, collectively could strengthen sustainable resource management efforts in the BRI economies.

The digital innovation cycles were measured using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Various influencing factors, including digital technologies, organisations, users, and the environment, were analysed based on the Technology Affordance Theory (TAT). The results indicated that digital innovation efficiency in the Chinese manufacturing industry exhibited a fluctuating development trend and had considerable potential for future development. Digital innovation varied across sub-sectors, and the high-knowledge-intensive industries were subject to the greatest weaknesses. Digital innovation also changed significantly across regions in China. Furthermore, digital strategic orientation, executive education level, digital infrastructure, and regional digitalisation level negatively affected digital innovation. However, customer concentration positively affected digital innovation efficiency. Comprehensive guidance and implications for multiple perspectives are presented to enhance digital innovation by manufacturing enterprises.

AB  - Economic progress drives industrial development, leading to increased natural resource extraction. The excessive use of natural resources through practices such as cultivation, deforestation, and excavation can harm ecological quality. In line with this, the present study examines the influence of natural resources on CO2 emissions in China. The study covers 31 years, from 1990 to 2021, and employs the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributive Lag (NARDL) methodology. The empirical findings indicate that a positive shock in natural resources reduces CO2 emissions, while a negative shock in natural resources increases CO2 emissions. Additionally, the study reveals that information and communication technology (ICT) and foreign direct investment (FD) contribute to the rise in CO2 emissions. Causality analysis further confirms these associations. Based on the empirical investigations, it is deduced that the economy should devise strategies to manage natural resources effectively. Furthermore, adopting renewable energy emerges as a crucial approach to mitigate CO2 emissions in the studied economy.

AB  - Urbanization as a global phenomenon is a multifaceted process, that affects the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in and around urban areas. Here we do the first global attempt to characterize the complexity of urbanization from 2000 to 2015 in terms of population, built-up structure, and greenness, as well as monitoring land-energy-air SDG trends at the grid level covering all inhabited areas. We used Global Human Settlement Layer to assess population, built-up structure, and land use efficiency (SDG 11.3.1), combined MODIS/Terra & GIMMS NDVI to monitor greenness, distributed statistical energy consumption by night lights and population for energy efficiency (SDG 7.3.1), and used near-surface PM2.5 dataset to represent air quality (SDG 11.6.2). Results show that 1) increased population density and built-up patch density were dominant in Asia and Africa, while urbanization in Europe and North America took a rather steady pace; 2) in land-energy-air sustainability trends, urban areas perform relatively better than rural areas in the Global South, while urban areas in the Global North tend to be less sustainable than their surrounding rural regions; 3) urbanization processes would not slow down the achievement of SDGs after a turning point. Our findings facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the global urbanization-land-energy-air nexus. Integrating Earth Observation data is crucial for tracking urbanization and SDGs, and can guide context-specific strategies towards a sustainable and livable future instead of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ policy for cities.

AB  - In response to the international situation, climate change, and the impact of limited energy resources, countries have seen a rise in environmental awareness, leading to the emergence of green design and the circular economy. In 2015, the United Nations identified major global issues and proposed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which encompass economic, social, and environmental dimensions. These 17 goals are to be reviewed in 2030 to assess the progress and actions taken by countries. Taiwan is also facing various changes and developed the "Taiwan Sustainable Development Goals" in 2019 to align with international sustainable development trends. Education crucial role in cultivating core knowledge, attitudes, and skills in students. Building on this foundation, this st udy aims to implement SDGs in communication courses and explore the feasibility and impact of integrating SDGs into university- level communication curricula. The experimental process was divided into two phases. The first phase involved 111 students from the Department of Mass Communication, while the second phase included 58 students from 11 different colleges, representing diverse interdisciplinary backgrounds. The experimental results indicated that: (1) Over 68% of the participants used social networks for more than 3 hours daily; (2) Instagram was the most used social media platform (over 91%), followed by YouTube (over 87%) and Line (over 84%); (3) The most viewed content type was "entertainment" (over 91%), followed by "lifestyle" (over 69%) and "knowledge" (over 47%); (4) The impact of communication courses on SDGs development focused on "interdisciplinary integration," "digital revolution," and "circular economy" as the top three areas. Media is not only a tool for creating awareness of the SDGs but also plays a crucial role in the communication process, becoming a pillar in building a socially sustainable development. Strengthening the promotion of sustainable development education through school education is essential not only for environmental awareness but also for enabling people to make informed decisions that achieve environmental integrity, economic feasibility, and social justice and soundness.

AB  - Mitigating climate change and improving global energy security require a shift to renewable energy. United Nations has declared, switching to renewable energy as one of its sustainable development goals. To achieve this, renewable energy production and consumption, has to be analyzed.. To estimate the ratio of renewable energy output to consumption, we use a variety of machine learning models, including XGBoost, CatBoost etc and evaluation metrics like R2, MSE etc. for performance evaluation. According to our findings, several important variables can be used to forecast the energy efficiency of renewable sources, including production capacity, grid integration, levels of energy use etc. With high R-squared values of 0.9291 and 0.9483, the Gradient Boosting and XGBoost Regressor respectively, exhibit excellent performance, underscoring their resilience in terms of prediction accuracy. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders to optimize renewable energy strategies globally, contributing to a more sustainable energy future.

AB  - The uneven matching of distribution and targets in practicing carbon emission reduction has led to emission reduction inequality, while digital technology innovation (DTI) is expected to reduce these gaps. Therefore, this study casts new insights into modeling the nexus between DTI and carbon inequality using China's 286 prefecture-level cities from 2000 to 2021. Remarkably, city-level DTI performance is innovatively proxied by the related patent application volume, while the carbon inequality index within the region is measured using the environmental Gini coefficient. The main findings of this study include: (1) DTI robustly mitigates China's carbon inequality. (2) The effect of DTI is asymmetrically more significant in regions with a higher carbon inequality index. (3) DTI heterogeneously reduces carbon inequality more obviously in the eastern and central regions, and technology innovation in digital product manufacturing and digital technology application industries reduces carbon inequality more significantly. (4) More precisely, DTI strengthens carbon justice through income equalization, spatial agglomeration, and digital inclusion effects. Specifically, DTI significantly reduces income inequality and the digital economy's spatial agglomeration level and enhances digital financial inclusion, thereby reducing carbon inequality. This study also provides the policy implications for China.

AB  - Food fraud is a pressing global challenge with far-reaching implications, necessitating robust preventive measures. The safeguarding of consumers from hazardous products, the preservation of supply chain integrity, and the assurance of fair competition all rely on effective anti-fraud strategies. Intelligent packaging technologies are pivotal in reducing food fraud through anti-tampering measures and traceability. However, standalone intelligent packaging technologies cannot alone establish comprehensive traceability within the food chain. This review asserts that integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can bolster traceability and combat food fraud. Blockchain enhances transparency, while AI enables precise analysis of extensive datasets. This comprehensive review critically examines the potential of combining blockchain and AI technologies with intelligent packaging to address food fraud. It thoroughly delineates the strengths and limitations of these technologies in detecting and mitigating fraud across the supply chain. The amalgamation of diverse technologies within intelligent packaging presents a holistic approach to mitigating significant fraud, contingent upon the effective resolution of technical, cost, and safety challenges. In conclusion, integrating sophisticated technologies into intelligent packaging offers a promising avenue to effectively combat food fraud, instill consumer trust, and maintain the integrity of the food supply chain.

AB  - ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with an increasing popularity and applications in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. Although many of these areas closely relate to the urban context, there is limited understanding of the trending AI technologies and their application areas—or concepts—in the urban planning and development fields. Similarly, there is a knowledge gap in how the public perceives AI technologies, their application areas, and the AI-related policies and practices of our cities. This study aims to advance our understanding of the relationship between the key AI technologies (n = 15) and their key application areas (n = 16) in urban planning and development. To this end, this study examines public perceptions of how AI technologies and their application areas in urban planning and development are perceived and utilized in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories. The methodological approach of this study employs the social media analytics method, and conducts sentiment and content analyses of location-based Twitter messages (n = 11,236) from Australia. The results disclose that: (a) digital transformation, innovation, and sustainability are the most popular AI application areas in urban planning and development; (b) drones, automation, robotics, and big data are the most popular AI technologies utilized in urban planning and development, and; (c) achieving the digital transformation and sustainability of cities through the use of AI technologies—such as big data, automation and robotics—is the central community discussion topic.

AB  - ABSTRACT The urbanization problems we face may be alleviated using innovative digital technology. However, employing these technologies entails the risk of creating new urban problems and/or intensifying the old ones instead of alleviating them. Hence, in a world with immense technological opportunities and at the same time enormous urbanization challenges, it is critical to adopt the principles of responsible urban innovation. These principles assure the delivery of the desired urban outcomes and futures. We contribute to the existing responsible urban innovation discourse by focusing on local government artificial intelligence (AI) systems, providing a literature and practice overview, and a conceptual framework. In this perspective paper, we advocate for the need for balancing the costs, benefits, risks and impacts of developing, adopting, deploying and managing local government AI systems in order to achieve responsible urban innovation. The statements made in this perspective paper are based on a thorough review of the literature, research, developments, trends and applications carefully selected and analyzed by an expert team of investigators. This study provides new insights, develops a conceptual framework and identifies prospective research questions by placing local government AI systems under the microscope through the lens of responsible urban innovation. The presented overview and framework, along with the identified issues and research agenda, offer scholars prospective lines of research and development; where the outcomes of these future studies will help urban policymakers, managers and planners to better understand the crucial role played by local government AI systems in ensuring the achievement of responsible outcomes.

AB  - As a cross-regional infrastructure and major public project, high-speed rail (HSR) can significantly impact regional economic development, but few studies focus on its effects on intra-regional inequality. This study takes the opening of HSR stations as a quasi-natural experiment and employs a staggered difference-in-differences (DID) model to empirically examine the characteristics and mechanisms of HSR's impact on intra-city digital inequality. The results show that: (1) The opening of HSR stations reduces digital inequality within a city, mainly because it significantly enhances the digital development level of disadvantaged counties compared to advantaged ones. (2) Mechanism analysis indicates that HSR reduces the digital divide by stimulating innovation equilibrium, financial equilibrium, and local fiscal revenue equilibrium effects within a city. (3) Heterogeneity analysis shows that HSR significantly impacts internal digital inequality only in high-slope, economically underdeveloped, and peripheral areas. (4) Spatial tests reveal that HSR also helps reduce digital inequality within neighboring cities. This study not only enriches the theoretical understanding of the economic effects of HSR development but also provides policy insights on how regions can eliminate digital inequality and close intra-regional digital divides.

The majority of these products have a short lifespan before being discarded, creating a significant amount of e-waste. The e-waste contains toxic metals which if not disposed properly, have severe health and environmental consequences. Existing studies have been focusing on legislations and policies in tackling e-waste management in developing countries. This study aimed at understanding ICT students' knowledge and awareness of issues related to e-waste and its management in Tanzania. The data was collected from a sample of 512 students taking ICT courses in two universities using a questionnaire as a data collection tool. The study found that the knowledge and awareness of students about e-waste management was low. The implications of these findings are discussed. Finally, strategies that can be adopted to tackle e-waste problem in developing countries have been proposed and discussed.

AB  - The hospitality industry stands at the cusp of a revolutionary transformation spurred by the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This paper explores the challenges and opportunities associated with AI integration in an arena historically reliant on the nuances of the human touch. The research illuminates the potential for AI to redefine facets of the hospitality experience, from augmenting customer interactions to refining service delivery and catalysing economic growth. It examines the potential for AI to infuse the hospitality industry with unprecedented levels of efficiency and personalised service while also addressing the complexities introduced by this digital evolution. The pivot towards AI is not without its impediments. Technological constraints, such as the significant investment required for the deployment of AI and the compatibility with existing systems, pose substantial barriers. Cultural resistance emerges from a workforce accustomed to traditional service norms, and ethical dilemmas surface over customer data use and machine-based interactions' impersonal nature. This research delineates these impediments, offering a panoramic view of the intricate dynamics. In dissecting the nuances of AI adoption, the study first harnesses a comprehensive literature review to pinpoint the pivotal factors at play. These variables are then intricately modelled through Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) analysis, which unravels the interdependencies and assigns a hierarchy based on driving and dependence power. This modelling facilitates a structured understanding of the challenges, setting the stage for strategic intervention. Validation of the TISM model ensues through MICMAC analysis, further refining the categorisation of factors by their level of influence. This dual-analytical paradigm affords a granular perspective on the factors that govern AI adoption, laying the groundwork for strategic solutions that are both nuanced and actionable. The results of the analyses reveal that while AI possesses the potential to disrupt the hospitality sector positively, its implementation requires a subtle approach that mitigates the identified challenges. In the wake of this analytical journey, the paper culminates with strategic recommendations designed to steer industry stakeholders through the AI adoption process. These recommendations stress the importance of a balanced approach that harnesses the strengths of AI to complement and enhance the human elements intrinsic to hospitality. This includes investing in employee training to work alongside AI tools, adopting transparent data practices to maintain customer trust, and fostering an organisational culture that embraces technological innovation while valuing human engagement.

To address this, China has launched a bold initiative to relocate data centers to the western region, leveraging natural cooling, clean energy, and cost-effective resources. By 2030, this move is expected to reduce emissions from the data center sector by 16%–20%, generating direct economic benefits of approximately 53 USD billion. The success of this initiative can serve as a model for other countries to develop their internet infrastructure.

AB  - The integration of digital solutions into existing energy infrastructure is crucial for enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of energy systems. However, successful integration requires careful planning and implementation. Digitalization also brings efficiency, flexibility, and reliability to an energy system, which requires a strong supply chain mechanism. This paper seeks to analyze the effect of energy system digitalization on the vulnerabilities of clean energy technology value chains in the OECD countries from 2000 to 2021, controlling for ecological footprint, renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption, and economic performance. Digitalization of energy systems, renewable energy consumption and Non-renewable energy consumption are found to be inversely related to securing the supply chain. The secure supply chain of clean energy technology has a direct and positive relationship with the ecological footprint and energy system digitalization, renewable energy consumption, non-renewable energy consumption and securing supply chains for clean energy technology are interrelated. Energy system digitalization supports clean energy technology supply chain resilience by positively correlated with renewable energy consumption but negatively correlated with non-renewable energy consumption. OECD countries should set up an overarching and coordinated system for reviewing, evaluating or auditing the performance of current and proposed schemes and steps linked to sustainability, distributed generation and electricity technologies, carbon dioxide emissions, and enhancement of energy systems.

AB  - This study utilizes the Cross-Sectional Fully Modified OLS (CSFMOLS) estimation technique to analyze how advancements in the digital economy and green technological imports impact private investment in renewable energy across 13 newly industrialized countries (NICs) from 2005 to 2020. The findings indicate that a 1% increase in internet users leads to a 0.63% rise in private investment in green projects, attributed to improved access to renewable energy information and enhanced collaboration among stakeholders. Additionally, a 1% increase in imports of wind turbines and solar panels results in a 0.24% boost in private investment. However, a 1% rise in carbon footprints decreases investment by 0.11%, underscoring the negative impact of fossil fuel reliance. Higher income levels encourage private sector engagement, while poverty rates impede it. The study recommends reducing bandwidth costs, leveraging AI for green solutions, and promoting regional trade agreements to foster sustainable development in NICs.

AB  - Currently, China is vigorously promoting the transformation of industrial enterprises' manufacturing, and low-carbon development has become an important research direction in the transformation, especially in the energy industry. For China's electric power enterprises, it is urgent to create a performance evaluation system and method suitable for the characteristics of this industry. This paper uses the DPSIR-TOPSIS model to simplify the complexity of the overall problem, and fully considers the impact of the overall environment to establish an indicator system and framework. Taking Shanghai Electric Power Co., Ltd. as an example under the background of impact of AI on low-carbon production as an example. Through the DPSIR-TOPSIS analysis driven by AI, the enterprise should have a clearer planning and understanding of the future strategy. On this basis, according to result of evaluation, combining with analysis of each yearly work done by the company, suggestions like companies need to keep informed of their state and respond,and to encourage relevant research, and form special support funds or support policies were given to improve the further low carbon work of China's power industry.

AB  - With growing attention on digitization and artificial intelligence (D&AI), interpreting their impact on urban carbon emissions has become critical. This study proposes an interpretable deep learning modeling framework considering variable feature interaction and heterogeneity to explore D&AI's carbon impacts. Random Forest (RF) is used to explore variable importance and optimize model parameters, followed by constructing a Decision Deep & Cross Feature-Transformation Network (DDCFTN) for high-fitting accuracy. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and causal inference are employed to interpret variable effects and heterogeneity. Using data from 275 Chinese cities (2000–2021), DDCFTN outperforms traditional statistical or machine learning models (RMSE=579.88, MAE=440.91, Radj2=0.994). Key findings include: 1) D&AI's contribution to carbon emissions is underestimated—interactive effects increase the carbon impact by 665.569%. 2) Staged interaction patterns are observed: Digitization initially suppresses AI-related emissions (-34.017% to -96.361%) but later enhances them (13.191% to 45.353%). 3) Asymmetrical interactions exist, with AI's impact on digitization's emissions peaking at just 0.119%, following an inverted U-shaped trend due to retro-regulation effects. 4) City characteristics (e.g., Location Conditions and Urban Scale) reshape the heterogeneity of D&AI emissions through chain reactions, acting as key antecedents. This study introduces a novel analytical paradigm for interpreting D&AI's carbon impact and guiding urban decarbonization policies.

AB  - Energy system resilience has become an escalating concern amid global economic developments, worsening climate change impacts, and localized regional conflicts. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal tool for enhancing energy system resilience. This study delves into the association between AI and energy system resilience, investigating underlying mechanisms and heterogeneity using a fixed effects model applied to data from the Group of 20 (G20) economies. Energy system resilience can be characterized by a country's energy vulnerability. Our findings suggest that AI effectively mitigates energy vulnerability. Specifically, its impact is more pronounced in high carbon-emitting countries, while it plays a more limited role in highly developed economies. Conversely, in less economically developed countries, AI adoption may exacerbate energy vulnerability. Through mediation analysis, we validate the role of AI in fostering industrial structural transformation and upgrading. However, the direct impact of industrial structure on energy vulnerability was statistically insignificant, warranting further investigation. These results underscore AI's efficacy in reducing energy vulnerability and provide strategic insights for addressing global energy challenges and promoting sustainable development on a global scale.

AB  - To figure out equitable and inclusive strategy to mitigate inequality of carbon emissions, we investigate the solution to narrowing carbon inequality from the perspective of developing artificial intelligence by using the generalized method of moments model and employing a panel dataset from 74 countries during 2000–2019. The asymmetric impact of artificial intelligence on carbon inequality is also checked. In addition, we examine the moderating and mediating effects in the nexus between artificial intelligence and carbon inequality. We find that (1) artificial intelligence has a negative causal relationship with carbon inequality, which indicates that developing artificial intelligence is essential for narrowing carbon inequality. (2) With the increase of the quantile of carbon inequality, artificial intelligence exerts a more remarkable inhibiting effect on carbon inequality, which implies that when the level of carbon inequality is more severe, the implementation of artificial intelligence proves to be a more potent tool for narrowing the disparity of emissions. (3) With the help of climate finance, artificial intelligence becomes even more effective in reducing carbon inequality, verifying the synergistic effect of climate finance and artificial intelligence on carbon inequality eradication. (4) Energy structure transition and industry structure transition are pathways through which artificial intelligence affects carbon inequality. Some concrete policy implications are drawn from the above main findings.

AB  - Alleviating cybersecurity risks associated with centralized AI training and implementation is a burgeoning challenge in the construction industry. This paper addresses two primary questions: (1) What is the knowledge of AI security vulnerability in construction, and (2) How can AI be decentralized using blockchain? To this end, this paper proposes a blockchain-AI integrated framework (BAII), enabling AI to be trained, verified, and applied on a decentralized blockchain. The framework has been successfully validated in an excavator pose recognition scenario, demonstrating acceptable latency and high performance with 95 % accuracy, 94 % precision, and 96 % recall. This research is pivotal for construction managers and IT security professionals, enhancing the reliability and safety of AI applications in construction. The decentralized AI (DAI) approach can also inspire further research into motivating constructors to contribute to AI modeling and training through incentive mechanisms in the blockchain.

AB  - Circular Economy and Sustainability in Industry 4.0 Era are promoters for carbon neutrality transformation, while their interconnected nexus and specific roles in low-carbon transition have not been clearly revealed. Furthermore, an integrated circular economy framework with buildings, PVs, battery and EVs, with overlaps in renewable-driven operational stages has not been considered in lifecycle decarbonization. This study is to reveal the nexus between Circular Economy and Sustainability in Industry 4.0 Era. Operational modes and mechanism of Circular Economy in PVs, buildings, electric vehicle industries and batteries are specifically analysed, together with energy and carbon flow analysis and optimization. Roles of Circular Economy in Sustainability have been provided, through an integrated circular economy framework with buildings, PVs, battery and electric vehicles (EVs), considering the overlap in renewable-energy driven operational stages in lifecycle decarbonization. Last but not the least, waste material recovery and waste-to-energy conversion have been analysed within the close-in-loop cycle for sustainability transition. Advanced digital technology in future Circular Economy is formulated with data-driven circular economy and internet-of-thing (IoT)-based waste-to-energy framework. Research results indicate that circular economy plays significant roles in sustainability, including cascade reuse paradigm, reverse supply chain with the recovery of end-of-life batteries, EV lifetime extension via repair and reuse, low carbon with refurbishing and remanufacturing, and less new primary materials via recycling materials, waste material recovery and waste-to-energy conversion. The renewable-driven battery-building-transportation-waste circular economy chain with the cross overlap in clean energy utilization can partially offset carbon emissions during the raw materials mining, manufacturing and recycling stages. This study can promote the waste to energy and advanced machine learning techniques with Circular Economy and Sustainability in Industry 4.0 Era.

AB  - The emission-reduction effects of the digital economy (DE) in the production sector have been extensively verified. Conversely, the impacts of the DE on consumption-side emission reduction remain a subject of debate and inconsistency. Hence, our study seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating the low-carbon footprint of the DE, drawing from micro-level data of Chinese residents. By employing the Consumer Lifestyle Approach (CLA) for measuring Residential Consumption Carbon Emissions (RCCE) and utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to gauge DE's development level, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: DE has resulted in an increase rather than a reduction in RCCE. These results are both statistically significant and robust, passing rigorous validity tests. The unanticipated outcome can be attributed to the DE's role in stimulating consumption expenditure through income and price effects. Furthermore, our research uncovers regional disparities in the impact of the DE on RCCE, primarily due to the presence of the digital divide. To mitigate this, we recommend targeted government interventions promoting green consumption practices, including awareness campaigns and eco-guidelines, to foster a sustainable consumption transition. These insights offer pivotal strategies for aligning the DE's progression with carbon reduction targets.

AB  - Investigating the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on energy vulnerability (EVI) is crucial to understanding how technological advances are changing the resilience and sustainability of energy systems. However, their quantitative relationship still lacks empirical evidence. This study first constructs the EVI of 54 global economies from the perspective of energy security, energy consumption, energy efficiency, and energy availability from 2000 to 2019. Then, a fixed-effect model is employed to investigate the relationship between AI and EVI. Results show that (1) AI can considerably reduce global EVI. The core findings remain reliable after several robustness checks. (2) Mechanism analysis implies that AI can reduce EVI by promoting financial development and technological progress. (3) Heterogeneity analysis implies that the impeding role of AI on EVI is more pronounced in countries with low incomes and industrialization levels. Furthermore, the hindering effect of AI on EVI is strengthened after Industry 4.0 and the financial crisis. Some policy implications are further proposed accordingly to reduce global EVI.
